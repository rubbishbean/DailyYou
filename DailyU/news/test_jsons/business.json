It's not real, at least in the sense that it's not meant to be taken seriously.\nBut in the far-right media, nobody appears to be in on the joke\u2014the joke, in this case being InfoWars host Alex Jones.\nThat's not an opinion, or any kind of hot take from us. That's actually via his lawyer .\nJones, who's emerged in recent years as a leading voice in (very) conservative media, is preparing to argue that his public persona is fake. He's a \"performance artist,\" Jones' lawyer told a court, during a recent hearing in preparation for a child custody trial between Jones and his ex-wife.\nThe lawyer reportedly used an analogy to Jack Nicholson playing the Joker in \"Batman,\" arguing that in a child custody case, Nicholson wouldn't be judged based on having once played the Joker, according to the Austin American-Statesman .\nWhether arguing that Jones is the Joker (or a joke), the fact that he's taken very seriously by his fans is an undisputed reality.\nFor those who might've lived a blessed life free of Jones, he's the radio host and CEO of Infowars.com, best known for peddling conspiracy-based \"news,\" like a \"report\" that the Sandy Hook massacre never happened . Jones also tends to go off on bizarre rants and, sometimes, rips his shirt off.\nJones (or at least his lawyer) is making this argument at what's arguably the height of his fame. Once just another shock jock, Jones built a strong following among anti-establishment conservatives that would later be seen as a major source of support for Donald Trump . Since his election, Infowars in particular has emerged as a reliably pro-Trump outlet. There were even reports that the Trump White House would be issuing press credentials to Infowars .\nInfowars , however, is Alex Jones, much in the way that Glenn Beck (in many ways the precursor to Jones) turned himself into a multimedia presence that catered to the far right. But where Beck's toned down his rhetoric and even seemed to take a step back from the spotlight, Jones is constantly front-and-center of his empire.\nAnd that person\u2014Alex Jones, of Infowars \u2014according to Jones' lawyer, is just an act.\nTo bolster his case, Jones is echoing a similar claim from a high profile trial that happened just more than a year ago\u2014 Hulk Hogan's lawsuit against Gawker.\nHogan at the time claimed that his privacy had been violated by the website's posting of a short clip of a sex tape depicting Hogan and the wife of a friend. Gawker claimed Hogan's own speech concerning his sex life made the footage newsworthy. Hogan then claimed that those public statements were part of his persona, and that the tape was of Terry Bollea (Hogan's given name).\nA Florida jury sided with Hogan, awarding him more than $140 million\u2014a finding that would force Gawker to be sold off. And Jones certainly can seem like a professional wrestler, growling into a microphone, or even confronting his rivals in person.\nIf Jones can use the Hogan defense, then the equivalence is clear: For Alex Jones and the far right, there's little (if any) difference. The world Jones inhabits is filled with cartoonish figures with shifting alliances and few journalistic scruples. Look at the adventures of figures like Milo Yiannopolous and Tomi Lahren, the latter of which became a far-right star after finding that embracing the fringe put her on television. Their calculated personas rival anything seen on the WWE\u2014just replace spandex with business casual, and the wrestling ring with Twitter.\nIt's a pretty nihilistic way to look at modern media, though not one entirely without its fans. Jeff Zucker, president of CNN, recently responded to criticism of the channel's willingness to put on less-than-qualified pro-Trump voices by saying that they're all \"characters in a drama.\" That drama? It's pushed CNN to the most successful run in its history .\nHow does journalism or the search for truth factor into all this? For Jones's character, it's a combination of the honesty of the jester and the \"I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore\" rage made famous in \" Network .\" Jones seems to ask: Can you trust your anchor if he's not tearing his shirt off? (Looking at you, Wolf Blitzer.)\nWhether Jones wins in court isn't terribly important to the media world (it is extremely important, of course, to the future of his family). In the Trump-based reality in which we now live, Jones is trustworthy even if he does end up telling a judge that his public persona is entirely fabricated. Besides, a Jones supporter might retort, all of media is fabricated .\nIt's just that Jones is just the most honest liar. Take his word for it.\nWATCH: 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' teaser trailer is finally here", "uuid": "ef4f963df94382a3c9d8aecc7a16bd55e004ab3c", "entities": {"organizations": [], "persons": [], "locations": []}, "highlightTitle": ""}, {"published": "2017-04-17T19:40:57.000+03:00", "highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3IPHFITWlqNQaFYYF_H3rMLp0hyHHN3OdlVDagmwM6ujKYNO2PYkMNr70KtUEK2uBAWz8UbCZKJt8Nduf9EU9nkRbEXcil3nnV60uNP.eQ2Ij8Q1B7KjRn6qzO3e4pMqPImzOd0dlEnVpMIVV0pMFMuQY_ku_sKuLn93QDiduZAig--", "thread": {"published": "2017-04-17T19:40:57.000+03:00", "spam_score": 0.0, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/j.JM_ertN3IPHFITWlqNQaFYYF_H3rMLp0hyHHN3OdlVDagmwM6ujKYNO2PYkMNr70KtUEK2uBAWz8UbCZKJt8Nduf9EU9nkRbEXcil3nnV60uNP.eQ2Ij8Q1B7KjRn6qzO3e4pMqPImzOd0dlEnVpMIVV0pMFMuQY_ku_sKuLn93QDiduZAig--", "site_full": "economictimes.indiatimes.com", "domain_rank": 116, "main_image": "http://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-58227720,width-672,resizemode-4,imglength-29172/news/defence/plastic-bullets-to-be-used-for-crowd-control-in-kashmir.jpg", "replies_count": 0, "title": "plastic bullets: Plastic bullets to be used for crowd control in Kashmir", "participants_count": 1, "section_title": "Defence-News-The Economic Times", "performance_score": 9, "site": "indiatimes.com", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 985, "likes": 985}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}}, "uuid": "654179da40084019d0b9fa4311011e632ba66a04", "site_section": "http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/defence/rssfeeds/46687796.cms", "country": "IN", "site_categories": [], "title_full": "plastic bullets: Plastic bullets to be used for crowd control in Kashmir - The Economic Times", "site_type": "news"}, "crawled": "2017-04-17T19:40:57.000+03:00", "rating": null, "title": "plastic bullets: Plastic bullets to be used for crowd control in Kashmir", "language": "english", "author": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "ord_in_thread": 0, "text": "NEW DELHI: Non-penetrative plastic bullets are likely to be used in Jammu and Kashmir for crowd control or stone-pelting mobs to reduce collateral damage during counter-insurgency operations. \n\nHowever, the pellet guns will continue to be used as the last resort in the non-lethal category. \n\nThousands of plastic bullets were produced and sent to the Kashmir Valley for use by the law enforcement agencies, official sources said. \n\nThe plastic bullets are non-penetrative and can be fired from INSAS rifles, the sources said. \n\nSecurity forces often face violent protests and stone pelting mobs, especially during stiff resistance from the locals, when they are engaged in gunfight with militants, who at times manage to escape with the help of the crowd. \n\nSo far, security forces are using PAVA shells and pellet guns, the last option in the non-lethal category before the use of assault rifles, to control the mobs. \n\nPAVA (Pelargonic Acid Vanillyl Amide) is a chilli-based ammunition, which is less lethal and immobilises the target temporarily. \n\nOther less-lethal weapons used include dye marker grenade with irritant which causes sensory trouble to the target once fired.

He was an assistant professor of finance at Stony Brook University, and he blogs at Noahpinion. Noah Smith \nEconomists who lean toward the free-market side of the ideological spectrum often say that tax cuts help the U.S. economy by encouraging people to work more. Greg Mankiw, a Harvard economist who earns a very high income from his famous textbooks, has repeatedly claimed that higher taxes will discourage him from working more. The supposed mechanism is simple -- tax cuts raise the amount of money you receive for an hour of labor, making people want to put in more hours. \nOthers are more skeptical. They point out that the top marginal federal income tax rate has fallen from more than 90 percent in the 1950s and \u201960s to less than 40 percent today, but instead of rising, the hours worked by employed people has actually fallen: Less Time in the Salt Mines Average annual number of hours worked per person* Source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis * Data series discontinued \nOf course, it might have fallen even more if tax cuts hadn\u2019t encouraged people to keep working. But careful research by economists has shown that taxes tend to have little effect on labor supply. One reason is that as taxes go down, people feel wealthier, and so don\u2019t feel as much pressure to work. By the same token, when taxes go up, people feel they need to put in more hours to make ends meet. These are what economists call income effects. A second reason taxes might have little impact is that most people don\u2019t get to choose how many hours they work -- their boss chooses for them. \nSo it looks as if Mankiw and others exaggerate the effects of tax cuts. But new research is finding that there\u2019s a big, important exception. When taxes go down for the poor, they really do work more. \nA recent paper by the University of Chicago Booth School of Business professor Owen Zidar demonstrates the differences between cutting taxes for the well-off and cutting them for those of modest means. He writes: \nTax cuts that go to high-income taxpayers generate less growth than\u2026cuts for low and moderate income taxpayers. In fact, the positive [overall] relationship between tax cuts and employment growth is largely driven by tax cuts for lower-income groups and the effect of tax cuts for the top 10%...is small. \nZidar looked at what happened to different states when federal taxes went up or down. Some states, such as Connecticut, have a lot of rich people, while others, like Mississippi, have a lot of poor people. Also, some federal tax cuts are weighted more toward the poor than others. Zidar found that tax cuts boosted employment in poorer states more than in richer ones, and the effect on those states was greater when those tax cuts favored the poor more. \nWhy do tax cuts for the poor help more than cuts for the rich? One reason is that rich people just aren\u2019t that likely to change how much they work in response to changes in tax rates. Most high earners receive a salary rather than getting paid by the hour, so they can\u2019t adjust how much they work. Nor are most executives, doctors, lawyers and financiers going to quit working because taxes went up. On top of that, it\u2019s possible that many top earners work because they like it, or because work itself brings them status, or because they need to maintain a wealthy lifestyle for social reasons. Middle-class people, on the other hand, are more likely to work because they need to buy things for their families -- tax cuts help them buy more necessities per hour worked, giving them reason to work more. And for poor people, a tax cut might make the difference in their decision whether to get a job or go on welfare, sponge off family or sell drugs. \nA second reason is that tax cuts have an effect on aggregate demand. Rich people save most of their money, so when you cut their taxes they tend to stick the extra money in the bank. But if you give poor or middle-class people a tax cut, they tend to go out and spend it, which increases demand via a multiplier effect . That tends to raise employment. \nSo if you want to boost the economy through tax cuts, give them to the middle class and the poor rather than the rich. That raises an interesting question -- how do you cut taxes for the poor? Low earners pay little if any income tax, but they do pay payroll taxes and sales taxes. \nA large portion of payroll taxes in the U.S. go to pay for Medicare. The U.S. could cut payroll taxes and shift Medicare funding toward income taxes. At the state level, shifting from sales taxes to income taxes could have similar effects. \nAnother way to cut taxes for the poor is to raise the level at which welfare benefits are phased out, or make phase-outs more gradual. When benefits disappear as income rises, it acts like a tax, because it effectively takes away some of each additional dollar earned. Raising the income cap for government benefits, or making the benefits disappear more slowly, acts like a tax cut for the poor. \nHigher earners certainly are not going to like the idea of shifting more of the tax burden onto their shoulders. But it\u2019s probably good for the economy, and for keeping the working class working.

Several vehicles are also understood to have caught fire. The light aircraft is said to have landed on a lorry which was unloading in the supermarket car park. Video footage taken by onlookers showed huge plumes of black smoke rising into the air from the scene of the crash. Ramiro Ribiero/Facebook Horrified locals survey the scene after the fatal crash \nThere is still no word on whether anyone on the ground was hurt or injured. The plane, believed to be registered in Switzerland, had just taken off from an aerodrome in Tires. The victims are being reported locally as the pilot and three passengers. \nA Twitter user who claims to have seen the crash said: \n\u201cI saw the plane going down!!

Mashable . \nSEE ALSO: United kicked off a bride and groom headed to their wedding, obviously \nPreviously crew members could get seats up until the very last minute \u2014 a policy which resulted in

This is one of our initial steps in a review of our policies in order to deliver the best customer experience,\" spokewoman Maggie Schmerin said in a statement.\n\"Our review continues and we will share the results and additional concrete actions we will take by April 30.\"\nThe incident has highlighted the ways airlines handle bumping passengers off flights. At least two other airlines have changed or emphasised policies. Delta Airlines has reportedly authorised employees to give up to $10,000 in compensation to those on overbooked flights who give up their seats. American Airlines has said it won't remove a revenue passenger who is already on board to give a seat to another passenger.\nAs for United the image problems keep coming. The airline made headlines again over the weekend for kicking a bride and groom heading to Costa Rica for the wedding off a flight. The airline said they refused to leave seats they didn't pay for but the couple disagrees. However it really went down, it's still a headache for United and it doesn't seem like the headaches will go away any time soon.\nUPDATE: April 17, 2017, 1:25 p.m. BST Added additional info from United statement.\nWATCH: If you give up your seat on a Delta flight you could get almost $10,000", "uuid": "7e78f41bec69e736236e7c4e7c925856c80e90cf", "entities": {"organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "united"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "united airlines"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "utc"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "delta"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "american airlines"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "delta airlines"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "david dao"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "liza hearon"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "costa rica"}]}, "highlightTitle": ""}, {"published": "2017-04-17T08:00:00.000+03:00", "highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpeA7d5kQu_ox8Fegh9nXHF", "thread": {"published": "2017-04-17T08:00:00.000+03:00", "spam_score": 0.153, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCpeA7d5kQu_ox8Fegh9nXHF", "site_full": "backlinko.com", "domain_rank": 10466, "main_image": "http://backlinko.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/backlinko.png", "replies_count": 0, "title": "SEO Training and Link Building Strategies \u2013 Backlinko", "participants_count": 0, "section_title": "", "performance_score": 8, "site": "backlinko.com", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 450}, "vk": {"shares": 1}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 810, "likes": 810}, "linkedin": {"shares": 71}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}}, "uuid": "5241a9a93e439d057a70c15fe8623eaa9165032f", "site_section": "", "country": "US", "site_categories": [], "title_full": "SEO Training and Link Building Strategies \u2013 Backlinko", "site_type": "news"}, "crawled": "2017-04-17T13:49:45.000+03:00", "rating": null, "title": "SEO Training and Link Building Strategies \u2013 Backlinko", "language": "english", "author": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "text": "Enter your email below to get access to my proven SEO and traffic tips Sign Up \nWhen it comes to link building, Brian Dean is the best in the business.

Now she rakes in millions of dollars for charities. by \nAbra Annes. Photographer: Michael Short/Bloomberg \nAbra Annes doesn\u2019t get uncomfortable. The emotion evoked by first dates, small talk, and personal questions doesn\u2019t plague a woman who\u2019s made a career asking strangers for huge sums of money while wearing head-to-toe floral print. \n\u201cA big piece of my job is embracing the awkward silences of fundraising,\u201d the 35-year-old Californian says. \u201cYou have to ask, and then just shut your mouth and enjoy the silence. The silence settles and it can be heavy\u2014and sometimes people get so uncomfortable that they\u2019ll give more to fill the void. I enjoy the silence.\u201d \nAs a professional fundraiser, Annes works primarily with non-profits to rake in as much cash as possible from wealthy donors. Her consulting fee starts at $4,000 and tops out at $10,000\u2014plus a bonus if she brings in more than the preset goal. \nAnnes is a benefits auctioneer, among the fastest growing specialties in the industry, according to the National Auctioneers Association . Benefits auctioneers specialize in nonprofit fundraising\u2014they aren\u2019t the buttoned-up, gavel wielding art house auctioneer that may come to mind, and certainly not the hundred-miles-a-minute version that presides over a cattle pen. \nMillions of dollars are forked over annually in the name of some greater good as Americans bask in the self-affirming glow of a charitable event. Charities host them for two primary purposes: soliciting donations, and meeting new people from whom they can solicit more donations. \nIn exchange, eventgoers are treated to an open bar, dinner, entertainment, and cameras ready to plaster their faces on the society page. The fundraising element can come in many forms: a silent auction, a traditional auction in which items and elaborate trips are sold off, or so-called fund-a-needs\u2014Annes\u2019 specialty. The charity business \nTypically, Annes is hired six months before an event. She gets involved in everything from social media strategy to the style of invitations, as the tiniest detail can influence how guests donate. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you can have a successful fundraiser unless I know how the fundraiser is supposed to work,\u201d she says. \u201cYour auctioneer up on stage is basically the emissary of the organization.\u201d \nBefore she agrees to a job, she researches the group to ensure her values align with it. Her passions include the environment, social services, education, Jewish services, and children\u2019s aid. She declines requests to discuss politics on stage. \nIf she signs on, Annes and the charity\u2019s staff conduct a series of calls to plan out the strategy, invitation list, event flow, honorees, and social media strategy. Perhaps most importantly, she focuses on seating so she knows where to look for the most money. \n\u201cWhere are your heavy hitters?\u201d is the key question she asks. \nAt a fund-a-need event, the audience is asked to make a donation in exchange for nothing but gratitude, albeit in a public forum. The auctioneer begins by asking if anyone is willing to donate an enormous sum of money\u2014in some cases $100,000 or more\u2014then works their way down to more accessible donation requests. \n\u201cAt any auction, no matter what the organization, you only have, total, maybe eight to 15 bidders. They\u2019re going to bid on everything. The rest of the audience will sit there and watch,\u201d Annes says. \u201cBut in the fund-a-need, everyone can participate. Everyone has the capacity to give. Everyone can afford $50. That\u2019s where most organizations bring in the big money.\u201d \nAnnes contends she can typically increase donations by 50 to 100 percent from a previous year\u2019s event during a fund-a-need. \u201cYou should really only hire me if you\u2019re ready to take your auction to the next level,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you want to move from $500,000 to $1 million, or $1 million to $2 million. But I don\u2019t do your neighborhood school auction.\u201d Cruise line warm-up act \nAnnes has a signature opening move. \u201cI go out into the audience and I ask for something, something that\u2019s auctioned off somebody. I've taken a dollar out of a tech founder\u2019s wallet, or I\u2019ll take a tie off of the Ambassador to India, or M.C. Hammer\u2019s glasses or Will.I.Am\u2019s headphones,\u201d she explains, checking off some boldface names. \u201cThey go anywhere from $500 to $20,000. A one dollar bill and used headphones have no value. [But] that gets the crowd warmed up and ready to go.\u201d Photographer: Michael Short/Bloomberg \nIt\u2019s all an illusion, of course. The tech founder, Ben Silbermann of Pinterest, was approached in advance to ask if he would be comfortable having a dollar with his signature auctioned off, she says. Annes even handed him the buck to use. Will.I.Am (real name: William Adams) doesn\u2019t randomly wear headphones to a charity event\u2014Annes says she asked the music mogul to don them so she\u2019d have something to take off of him and auction. This behind-the-scenes orchestration is a take away from her former, less glamorous career as a cruise ship \u201centertainer,\u201d which meant everything from warming up a crowd to organizing hairy chest contests. \nWhile studying at Northwestern University, Annes got a gig as a dancer for an entertainment company that hosted Bar Mitzvahs and birthdays. She worked her way up to emcee, and during her summers spent time interning for a communications firm, which offered her a job upon graduation. \u201cMy senior summer, I realized I hadn\u2019t had a lot of fun in college,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI had been on a cruise and had seen all these cruise entertainer people using microphones. I went on Monster.com, I searched cruise. I got a call the next day.\u201d Annes asked for a delayed start date at the firm, flew to Florida and boarded a Carnival cruise liner. \u201cIf I can ask people to be in a hairy chest contest, I can certainly ask people to donate money.\u201d \nAfter a month, Annes realized she wasn\u2019t going back. Instead, she worked about four hours a day setting up entertainment for cruise ship guests, much of which had to be organized ahead of the event. \u201cWe would go out on the pool deck and do \u2018spontaneous\u2019 games,\u201d she says. One of the more frequent forms of entertainment was a hairy chest contest. \u201cThey would ask all the men with hairy chests to come down. But we would make sure the hairiest men were down already.\u201d \nIn her off hours, Annes would bum around the ship, sunbathe, and occasionally sit in on art auctions. The auctioneer sometimes asked her to clerk the event. After seeing her work the mic during a pool deck event, he asked Annes to warm up the auctions. She stayed on the boat for almost three years, learning to work a crowd. \nBy the time she left the cruise ship, she was in her mid 20s, jobless, and carless. \u201cA lot of my friends had gone the consulting route, Bain, McKinsey. And I could not get a job.\u201d On a whim, she applied to the fundraising division of the Jewish Federation of Minneapolis. \u201cI told them because I was on a cruise ship, I had a lot of experience selling things to people. If I can ask people to be in a hairy chest contest, I can certainly ask people to donate money.\u201d Language and tactics \nMentored by a fundraising expert who taught her the language and tactics of the industry, Annes stayed with the nonprofit for several years, jumping to the San Francisco office. \u201cI went to a charity auction myself and there was a terrible, terrible auctioneer,\u201d she recalled. \u201cI said, \u2018Oh my god, this is everything I know how to do. I know how to entertain and ask for money.\u2019\u201d \nAt another event, Annes ran into a more skilled auctioneer and took down his phone number. She repeatedly contacted him\u2014and three other auctioneers\u2014until she got a job. After some time working for someone else, she launched Generosity Auctions. \u201cI get hired most of the time for those three or four sentences. Then I go get the money.\u201d \nToday, Annes says she gets more requests than she can handle, doing as many as 50 events a year. She practices her fundraising skills constantly, recites speeches into a hairbrush while driving, talks to every person she encounters, and records each event to review later. But part of her skill as an auctioneer is a sort of sixth sense. \nAnnes has developed a formula for the fund-a-need: first she does an introduction and brings the room to a dead quiet. Then either a heart-wrenching or heart-warming story about the charity\u2019s work is told, either by a speaker or through a video. \n\u201cPeople have to be focused. Then comes the transition from the speaker or video to the fund-a-need,\u201d she says. \u201cThat transition has to be spot on. Perfection. I get hired most of the time for those three or four sentences. Then I go get the money.\u201d \nFund-a-needs typically begin with a lofty donation in the tens of thousands. The big donor is committed in advance (part of Annes\u2019 set-up) and usually gives at least $25,000, she says. \nAnnes on stage at the San Francisco Design Center. Photographer: Michael Short/Bloomberg \nSometimes, though, she will start higher than the pre-committed amount, depending on how the event feels to her. \u201cThat\u2019s something I know in my bones,\u201d she says. \u201cIt also depends how amazing the speaker was before me.\u201d \nAnnes is mindful of her word choice. \u201cYou have to be willing to ask in a way you would want to be asked,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have to sound very fun, very kind, very light. A lot of \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018we\u2019 language, instead of \u2018you.\u2019 During the fund-a-need, Annes uses inspiring language: she requests \u201ca generous gift\u201d or a \u201cbeautiful donation.\u201d Sometimes she asks the crowd to make \u201can investment in the organization.\u201d \nIn addition to reviewing footage of her events and rehearsing speeches, she practices memorizing names with mnemonic devices, so when she transitions from the event\u2019s cocktail hour to the seated auction or fund-a-need, she can refer to people by name. Floral, metallic, and baby pink \nAs a woman in a male-dominated industry, Annes is mindful of her appearance. \u201cI study the shit out of all the other auctioneers in the industry. I know what they all wear. I have a spreadsheet,\u201d she says. \u201cMost of the women wear dresses and men wear tuxedos. What could I wear that will set me apart?\u201d Your cheat sheet on life, in one weekly email. Get our weekly Game Plan newsletter. Sign Up \nFloral, metallic, and baby pink. Annes wears eye-popping suits, always completing the outfit with a metallic shoe\u2014gold, silver, or even a blingy copper. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be the person who asks for money, you need to really own who you are and be able to be seen. Like, \u2018yep, she\u2019s the auctioneer!\u2019\u201d Her choice of attire is so popular that clients often make requests on which suit she should wear. She has a spreadsheet for this too, making sure the same crowd doesn\u2019t see the same outfit twice. \nAnnes says she\u2019s not just an auctioneer, but a participant in charitable giving as well. She sits on nonprofit boards and donates in the five figures annually. Startups have approached her to help with funding rounds, she says, but she\u2019s not interested\u2014though she says she\u2019d love to get into political fundraising. \n\u201cI always work with people I believe in,\u201d Annes says. \u201cI don\u2019t identify as an auctioneer\u2014I feel more like a philanthropist. This is money we\u2019re raising together. I\u2019m helping other people raise their hand.\u201d Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

He \"shut down all his emotions\" for nearly two decades, despite his brother Prince William trying to persuade him to seek help.\n\"My way of dealing with it was sticking my head in the sand, refusing to ever think about my mum, because why would that help?\" he said .\n\"(I thought) it's only going to make you sad, it's not going to bring her back. So from an emotional side, I was like 'right, don't ever let your emotions be part of anything.'\"\nHe realised that he had never dealt with the grief and he needed help. \n\"Some of the best people or easiest people to speak to is a shrink or whoever - the Americans call them shrinks - someone you have never met before.\n\"You sit down on the sofa and say 'listen, I don't actually need your advice. Can you just listen'. And you just let it all rip,\" he said. \n\nPrince Harry with his mother in July 1986.\nImage: Tim Graham/Getty Images\nAs a coping strategy he advises taking up a hobby or sport, instead of trying to take things out of your life.

We have bitten our lips, slapped on rictus grins, kept buggering on.\"\n\"He has shown the world that talking about your problems is nothing to be ashamed of \u2013 that actually, it is something to be positively encouraged.

Robert W Taylor, a computer scientist who was instrumental in creating the Internet as well as the modern personal computer, has died at the age of 85. Mr. Taylor, who is best known as the mastermind of ARPAnet (precursor of the Internet), had Parkinson's disease and died on Thursday at his home in Woodside, California, his son Kurt Kurt Taylor told US media . While the creation of the Internet was work of many hands, Mr. Taylor made many contributions. As a researcher for the US military's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in 1966, Taylor helped pioneer the concept of shared networks, as he was frustrated with constantly switching between 3 terminals to communicate with researchers across the country. His frustration led the creation of ARPAnet \u2014 a single computer network to link each project with the others \u2014 and this network then evolved into what we now know as the Internet. In a legendary 1968 essay , Mr. Taylor correctly predicted ARPAnet would become an efficient and necessary utility for the public in the future: a vast, decentralized grid of interconnected devices that would reshape communication at every level. \"In a few years, men will be able to communicate more effectively through a machine than face to face,\" Taylor wrote in the 1968 paper. Besides this, Mr. Taylor also played a key role in the creation of the computer Mouse . While working as a project manager for NASA in 1961, he learned of research into the direct interaction between humans and computers being conducted by computer scientist Douglas Engelbart (who died in 2013) at the Stanford Research Institute. Mr. Taylor directed much funding to Engelbart's research, which led to the invention of the mouse, that became an essential element of both Macintosh and Microsoft Windows-based PCs. After almost a decade, Taylor moved on to Xerox's legendary Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in Northern California, where he oversaw the creation of the Alto , a pioneering personal computer. The Alto was the first PC designed to support an operating system based on a graphical user interface with icons, windows, and menus instead of typing text commands in computer language \u2014 a concept that's copied by the operating systems that would follow. Taylor's engineering team also helped develop the networking technology Ethernet and a word processing program called Bravo that became the basis for Microsoft Word. Born in Dallas on 10 February 1932, Mr. Taylor was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 1999 for \"visionary leadership in the development of modern computing technology, including computer networks, the personal computer, and the graphical user interface.\" Mr. Taylor, along with other PARC researchers, was also awarded the National Academy of Engineering's Draper Prize in 2004 for the development of \"the first practical networked personal computers.\" Mr. Taylor retired in 1996.

It cost about 12 million krona ($1.3 million) to hire the 17 extra staff members needed to fill the gaps created by shorter work hours. The city had only budgeted for two years, and legislators said it would be too expensive to implement the project across the entire municipality. \nSo, for now, the project has come to an end. Yet, there are longer term savings the study didn\u2019t take into account. Working shorter hours resulted in healthier workers, researcher Bengt Lorentzon found in a new paper. \u201cThey were less tired, less sick, had more energy coming home and more time to do activities,\u201d said Lorentzon. \nSpecifically, the nurses took fewer sick days than they did when working longer, eight hour days. They also took fewer sick days than nurses in the control group. In fact, they took fewer sick days than nurses across the entire city of Gothenburg. \nOverall, they took 4.7 percent fewer sick days over the period of the experiment, while nurses in the control group took 62.5 percent more sick days over the same time frame. Nurses who worked fewer hours took less unexpected time off, too. \nWhile the study found health and productivity benefits, it didn\u2019t measure the potential long term cost savings of healthier nurses. But one thing is clear, Lorentzon says : These improved attitudes and health led to higher quality care at the nursing home.In general, the working population of nurses in Sweden are in worse health than the average Swede. The women in the facility have higher body mass indices than the average worker, for example. While the study didn\u2019t run long enough to fully measure health effects of shorter days, the research indicates nurses working only six hours will experience permanent health benefits, resulting in savings. \n\u201cThe satisfactory blood pressure is slightly lower for nurses at Svartedalens and the reference facility in comparison to the normal value for all professional women,\u201d the study found. \nHealthier employees spend half as much on health care, a new study published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings found. Looking at 10,000 employees at a health system in Florida, researchers found that those who were in \u201cideal\u201d cardiovascular health, using the American Hearth Association's Life\u2019s Simple 7 measurement 1 The American Heart Association has found that not smoking, eating healthy, being physically active, having a healthy weight, blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose levels correlate with low morbidity. People who fall in the ideal range for at least six of the seven metrics are considered in \"ideal\" cardiovascular health. Those who fall into the ideal range for two or less are considered in \"poor\" condition. , spent $4,000 a year less on health care costs than those in \u201cpoor\u201d heart health.

Sign Up \n\u201cA more complete analysis [of Sweden] would include the upside of having done it,\u201d said Eduardo Sanchez, one of the authors of the American study and Chief Medical Officer for Prevention at the American Heart Association. \u201cThe question is what were they measuring in terms of cost and what was included and what wasn\u2019t included?\u201d The Svartedalens experiment didn\u2019t calculate the health savings cost of healthier nurses at all, let alone consider long term savings. \nThe nurses working six hour days reported having more energy and less stress during the trial. Sanchez points to research that\u2019s found that people who feel good about their employer deliver better results at work. \u201cYou\u2019re going to be a better nurse when you have good feelings about your employer,\u201d he said. \nOther Swedish municipalities have started their own experiments on workforces with high burnout and poor health, but short-term costs remain their ultimate nemesis. Also, some studies conducted before the Gothenburg trial had less encouraging results than those at Svartedalens. \nBut even more daunting is the political reality facing such projects: The Left Party, which is behind the move away from 40 hour weeks, got only 6 percent of the vote in Sweden\u2019s last general election. Conservative politicians have already expressed opposition to the shortened workday, and even tried to shut down the Svartedalens experiment one year into its tenure. \nIn the U.S., some companies spend hundreds of dollars per employee on workplace wellness programs, hoping to save money on healthcare while maintaining productivity, albeit with the understanding that the eight-hour day should be viewed as a minimum at best. \nMaybe the solution isn\u2019t step challenges and diet contests, but shorter workdays.

Atheists should embrace the science of religion \u201cBelief-ologists\u201d are revealing how religion works. Belittling their work does nothing to further the secularists\u2019 cause, but learning from it might Steve Rainwater CC BY-SA 2.0 \nIT IS just over a decade since Richard Dawkins lit the blue touchpaper with his book The God Delusion . It introduced much of the world to the so-called new atheism \u2013 a forceful rejection of religion based on the premise that scientific materialism offers a superior explanation of the universe, while religion is a corrosive influence on society: a pathological meme planted in the minds of defenceless children. \nThough a great read and a liberating influence for many closet atheists, The God Delusion largely omitted a new strand of scientific enquiry emerging around the time it was published. Those working on the \u201cscience of religion\u201d \u2013 a motley crew of psychologists, anthropologists and neuroscientists \u2013 explained it as a by-product of normal cognition. Thanks to evolution, they argued, our explanation-seeking minds find religious ideas intuitively appealing, gobbling them up as a hungry trout swallows a fishing fly. Advertisement \nTo many disciples of the new atheism, this was little more than, well, heresy. They decried it as \u201caccommodationism\u201d \u2013 an illogical and often harmful attempt to pretend religion can still serve a purpose now that science rules the roost. Never mind that the cognitive by-product theory does not imply that religious beliefs are true \u2013 far from it. Nor does it claim religion and scientific materialism are compatible. It merely attempts to explore religious belief and disbelief using the tools of science, rather than rhetoric. \nThe new atheists attacked it anyway. In terms of public debate around the appropriate role of religion in society, this was a mistake. It alienated as many people as it won over, leaving the new atheists preaching to the converted, polarising the debate and dissuading moderates of both secular and religious persuasions from getting involved at all. \u201cTarring militants with their own brush undermines atheists\u2019 claim to occupy the intellectual high ground\u201d \nPerhaps most damagingly, it fostered an idea already doing the rounds: that atheism is a belief system whose adherents can be as blindly dogmatic as any other. In other words, that it is \u201cjust another religion\u201d. \nAt first glance this has all the sophistication of a playground taunting match: you smell. No, you smell. But as a rhetorical device it is highly effective. Tarring militant atheists with their own brush undermines their claims to the intellectual high ground, and when it came to some of the new atheists, it had the ring of truth to it. But is it really true of all the godless? \nOnce again, those practising actual science offer answers. The science of atheism, brought to you by the people who brought you the science of religion, says that atheism really isn\u2019t just another religion but something altogether different \u2013 although not for the reasons you may think (see \u201c Faith of the faithless: Is atheism just another religion? \u201c). No doubt militant atheists will say \u201cwe knew it all along\u201d; but perhaps they will also find some common ground with those they had dismissed as apologists. \nOr perhaps not. The science of religion challenges core elements of the new atheism: for example, the belief that religion leads on the whole to misery and suffering. Belief-ologists say religion was the \u201csocial glue\u201d that held early societies together . That doesn\u2019t mean religion is required to play that role today. But simply ignoring or high-handedly dismissing its power will not abolish its sway or further the secularist cause. And given the rise of religiosity in global affairs, there is much more than a rhetorical joust at stake. \nThis article appeared in print under the headline \u201cHolier than thou?\u201d \n ", "uuid": "b60f8f35b86c3b2835f4785aef7bbefb85c46da6", "entities": {"organizations": [], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "richard dawkins"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "steve rainwater"}], "locations": []}, "highlightTitle": ""}, {"published": "2017-04-17T12:51:09.000+03:00", "highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YuZjPcTcrfKQXWWp.8B_z87wDFwH_p5tJ.SrPIjSIGscpEo9cgTbhowgrQY9sQFGjYZj7Omzqpa.JB0ahsW_oi5ZrRBAkN8hj4t8CF_4BhRs8s407mJeKGmN.AZKFgAW36sJMA9fN73a8uHNkwHifsYo0KbBYF1yl94mdXMyyzm5UrHYl3NHDARlPTNAu9xA-", "thread": {"published": "2017-04-17T12:51:09.000+03:00", "spam_score": 0.0, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YuZjPcTcrfKQXWWp.8B_z87wDFwH_p5tJ.SrPIjSIGscpEo9cgTbhowgrQY9sQFGjYZj7Omzqpa.JB0ahsW_oi5ZrRBAkN8hj4t8CF_4BhRs8s407mJeKGmN.AZKFgAW36sJMA9fN73a8uHNkwHifsYo0KbBYF1yl94mdXMyyzm5UrHYl3NHDARlPTNAu9xA-", "site_full": "www.financialexpress.com", "domain_rank": 4726, "main_image": "http://images.financialexpress.com/2017/04/MODI-TWITTER.jpg", "replies_count": 0, "title": "PM Narendra Modi inaugurates fully automatic cattle feed plant in Gujarat; here\u2019s all you need to know", "participants_count": 1, "section_title": "The Financial ExpressThe Financial Express", "performance_score": 7, "site": "financialexpress.com", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 727, "likes": 727}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}}, "uuid": "46721bad1457a57ca4f32342ef3abd9a29a19c70", "site_section": "http://www.financialexpress.com/feed/rss", "country": "US", "site_categories": [], "title_full": "PM Narendra Modi inaugurates fully automatic cattle feed plant in Gujarat; here\u2019s all you need to know", "site_type": "news"}, "crawled": "2017-04-17T12:51:09.000+03:00", "rating": null, "title": "PM Narendra Modi inaugurates fully automatic cattle feed plant in Gujarat; here\u2019s all you need to know", "language": "english", "author": "FE Online", "ord_in_thread": 0, "text": "India news PM Narendra Modi inaugurates fully automatic cattle feed plant in Gujarat; here\u2019s all you need to know PM Narendra Modi inaugurates fully automatic cattle feed plant in Gujarat; here\u2019s all you need to know Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday inaugurated a fully automatic cattle feed plant of Sumul Dairy at Bajipura village in Tapi district.

(Twitter image) \nPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday inaugurated a fully automatic cattle feed plant of Sumul Dairy at Bajipura village in Tapi district. Apart from this, he also inaugurated an ice-cream plant. PM Modi is in Gujarat on a two-day visit. Stressing on the need to increase per capita milk production, PM Modi said, \u201cAs far as milk production is concerned, we are doing well but we can do lot more.\u201d He also said that in the agriculture sector, this is the time for value addition and food processing. Lauding the SUMUL, PM Modi said, \u201cwe can also see the good that happens when farmers and dairies work closely.\u201d\u201cHere, in SUMUL we see the positive results that can be achieved when Sahkar and Sarkar work together.\u201d PM Modi said, \u201cTapi district is one of the newer districts of Gujarat. I am glad that the district has achieved remarkable progress.\u201d \nSumul or The Surat District Co-operative Milk Producers\u2019 Union Ltd, is one among the 17 district unions which acts as manufacturing units of dairy products for Gujarat Co-operative Milk Marketing Federation Limited, the marketers of Amul brand of products. \nYou may also like to watch \nSurat District has been a Pioneer in India in channeling trade in Cotton and Milk through co-operatives. \nEarlier today, PM Modi indicated that his government may bring in a legal framework under which doctors will have to prescribe generic medicines, which are cheaper than equivalent branded drugs, to patients. \nModi said his government brought in a health policy after 15 years and capped the prices of medicines and stents, which has angered some pharmaceutical companies. \nSpeaking at the inauguration of a charitable hospital here, he exhorted the wealthy people to come forward and contribute towards health care of the needy people. \nThis country has not been built by the kings and leaders alone but by the power of the people, he said. \n\u201cDoctors write prescriptions in such a way that poor people do not understand the handwriting, and he has to buy that medicine from private stores at high prices,\u201d Modi said. \n\u201cWe will bring in a legal framework by which if a doctor writes a prescription, he has to write in it that it will be enough for patients to buy generic medicine and he need not buy any other medicine,\u201d he said. \n\u201cIn our country doctors are less, hospitals are less and medicines are expensive.

The younger brother of SoftBank Group Corp.\u2019s founder said in Singapore on Monday he\u2019d become frustrated by regulation in Japan as well as the country\u2019s education system. \nTaizo Son Photographer: Akio Kon/Bloomberg \n\u201cI tried very hard by lobbying the Japanese government: \u2018Why don\u2019t we have a regulatory sandbox to bring some innovative ideas?,\u201d\u2019 Son told the event arranged by the private bank of DBS Group Holdings Ltd. \u201cBut the country\u2019s too big and very slow to move. But here, even the government, regulators are innovation-minded.\u201d \nSingapore\u2019s high rate of internet use and a reliance on online data-processing has helped propel Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong\u2019s Smart Nation initiative since it was launched in 2014. The program has seen the government, agencies and companies look to use technology to change how things are done, from self-driving buses and traffic management to public transport fares that are charged automatically. \nWith little crime, low personal tax rates and no capital gains tax, the country has already drawn other billionaires, including Eduardo Saverin, a co-founder of Facebook Inc. \nTaizo Son founded gamemaker GungHo Online Entertainment Inc. and is now chief executive officer of Mistletoe, a combination of early-stage venture firm, incubator and entrepreneur-in-residence program. His brother Masayoshi Son is chairman of SoftBank and is Japan\u2019s second-richest man with a net worth of $12.9 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. \nAfter moving to the wealthy enclave of Sentosa, Taizo Son expects to receive his permanent residency within three months. \nHe was partly motivated by his three-year-old son after losing confidence in Japan\u2019s education system, which he said has failed to adapt from the approach used to build the company into a postwar industrial giant. \nThe Japanese system is \u201cextremely terrible\u201d at creating entrepreneurs and Son said he intends to open a school in Singapore after recently opening a new school near Tokyo that encourages children to learn without teachers. \nAmong his existing investments in the region is games and e-commerce operator Garena, the most valuable startup in Southeast Asia. \nAt the event, Son laid out his vision for a futuristic city where large vehicles go underground, commuting is done on personal mobility devices and people can shower with water purification systems the size of a suitcase. \n\u201cI\u2019m getting an inspiration from Venice because inside Venice there is no car,\u201d he said. He added an aspiration to redesign cities away from the industrialized, car-centric model of the 20th century to one that is more \u201chuman-centric.\u201d Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Or at least that was my preference. \n\u201cBut I was puzzled by the absence of Guardiola. Ultimately I didn\u2019t want to go to Barcelona because of Guardiola\u2019s behaviour. But also because Mourinho was fighting so hard to get me, was so convincing, so warm, so keen. He was the complete opposite of the Barcelona coach.\u201d Times Newspapers Ltd Guardiola did not take the time to meet Ozil as he was on holiday Getty Images 3 Ozil is yet to sign a new contract with Arsenal leaving his future in doubt \nIn the book, Ozil also shed light on the deterioration of his relationship with Mourinho which ultimately led to him joining Arsenal. \nSpeaking about a half-time incident in the dressing room during a game with Deportivo, he said: \u201cTen minutes of the half-time break are over and Mourinho still isn\u2019t finished. I\u2019ve had enough now. \u2018What do you actually want from me?\u2019 I snap back at him. \u201c\u2018I want you to play as well as you can,\u2019 Mourinho yells. \u2018I want you to go into tackles like a man. Do you know what it looks like when you tackle? No? Let me show you.\u2019 Mesut Ozil passing to a substitute summed Arsenal's night up at Palace \"Mourinho stands on tiptoes, thrusts his arms down by his sides, purses his lips and minces around the dressing room. \u2018That\u2019s how you tackle. Ooh, I mustn\u2019t get hurt. And absolutely mustn\u2019t get dirty,\u2019 he shouts while repeating his Ozil tackle parody. \"\u2018If you\u2019re so great, why don\u2019t you get out there and play yourself?\u2019 I scream now, ripping off my jersey and hurling it at his feet. \u2018Here.

I wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on this and the Centre's explanation was baffling. They say they don't have a leader of opposition so they cannot appoint Lokpal yet.\" \n\nHazare shared his views in a telephonic conversation from Ralegan Siddhi as he was unable to make it to a day-long seminar organised by India Against Corruption Volunteers Association due to ill-health. Expressing anguish over the delay in appointing a Lokpal, Hazare issued a subtle warning of \"a churning\" that could take shape of a fresh movement against corruption. \"I think it's time to return to Ramlila Maidan once again. I don't know when that will be as yet, but for the next few months, we will go around the country and create awareness about Lokpal and electoral reforms to mobilise people,\" Hazare told TOI. \n\nHazare also talked of doing away with party symbols on EVMs. \"The Constitution talks about individual candidates contesting the polls, but since the first elections in 1952, the basic spirit has been violated as party symbols are attached to identity of the candidate. This needs to stop and Election Commission needs to step in for this to happen.\" Hazare said once a candidate's name and photo made it to the EVM, people would try to find out more about them instead of just pressing the button based on a political party. \n\nThe Gandhian also dismissed the idea of doing away with EVMs and replacing them with paper ballots as \"regressive in the age of information technology\". \n\nAt the Delhi seminar, meanwhile, renowned jurist Fali S Nariman asserted that \"a movement of the kind Anna Hazare led in 2011 and the momentum it gained is required now to bring both electoral and systemic reform\". He added: \"We believe in Lokpal: the Act is there but there's no Lokpal. The excuse given by the Attorney General to Supreme Court is that there is no leader of opposition so we cannot appoint a Lokpal. It is a peculiar logic.

It was the first back-to-back acceleration in seven years. \nOther indicators released Monday by the National Bureau of Statistics showed: Fixed-asset investment excluding rural areas expanded 9.2 percent for the first three months, accelerating from 8.1 percent growth last year Retail sales increased 10.9 percent from a year earlier in March, compared with a median estimate of 9.7 percent in a Bloomberg survey Industrial output rose 7.6 percent last month from a year earlier, compared with an estimated 6.3 percent rise \n\"For the first time in the recent years, China starts a year with a strong headline GDP,\" said Raymond Yeung, chief greater China economist at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in Hong Kong, who correctly forecast the growth pace. \"Thanks to strong investment and property, the economy is performing well.\" \nThe expansion further cements a rebound as producer prices surge, industrial output picks up and soaring credit fuels investment. Policy makers have shifted to a more neutral monetary stance as they seek to ease financial risk and reduce excess industrial capacity. \n\"The first quarter growth is mainly driven by reflation and very strong property sales and investment,\" said Larry Hu, head of China economics at Macquarie Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. \"This strong data would give more confidence to maintain a tightening stance.\" \nThe broadest measure of new credit rose more than estimated last month amid strong growth in shadow banking. Aggregate financing grew 2.12 trillion yuan ($308 billion). Nominal Surge \nIn current-price terms, the economy expanded 11.8 percent from a year earlier, according to Bloomberg Intelligence estimates. \n\"That\u2019s making the problem of excess leverage look a little more manageable \u2013 at least as long as factory reflation stays strong,\" BI economists Tom Orlik and Fielding Chen wrote in a \nThe labor market has been holding up too: The surveyed jobless rate fell in March from February, while the level in big cities was below 5 percent at end of last month, the NBS said. China added 3.34 million new jobs in the first quarter. \nOther data pointed to further rebalancing away from the old industrial growth drivers. Consumption contributed 77.2 percent to growth in the first quarter, an NBS spokesman said at a briefing in Beijing. Last year, 64.6 percent of growth came from consumption. \n\"The rebound in retail sales growth was particularly important as it indicates that consumer spending remains strong,\" said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist at IHS Markit in Singapore. \"The upturn in Chinese growth is a very positive indicator for the Asia Pacific and world growth in 2017, as well as underpinning the near-term outlook for global commodities.\" \nOne measure of consumer earnings slowed. Growth of median per-capita disposable income decelerated to 6.7 percent in the first quarter, down from 8.3 percent last year and slower than GDP expansion for the first time since NBS began releasing the gauge in March 2014. Investment Momentum \nDespite recent property tightening measures, investment momentum is likely to stay strong in coming months amid heavy infrastructure investment. The April 1 announcement of the new Xiongan economic zone portends massive construction spending and suggests authorities are likely to remain reliant on investment to help support longer-term growth. \nThe Xiongan New Area will \"hugely\" promote economic development, an NBS spokesman said at a briefing in Beijing. \nElsewhere in data released Monday: China, which produces half the world\u2019s steel, churned out a record quantity in March as production of crude steel expanded 1.8 percent from a year earlier Coal production rebounded in March after the government said it doesn\u2019t intend to reintroduce widespread restrictions this year as long as prices remain acceptable to regulators Oil production stagnated in the first quarter, averaging 3.91 million barrels a day \nInvestment in property development rose 9.1 percent in the first three months from a year earlier, compared with 8.9 percent in the first two months and 6.9 percent in 2016. Yet developers may find 2017 more challenging, as about a dozen cities have imposed tighter restrictions on purchases to curb a frenzy of speculation. \n\"Growth remained strong on the back of continued strength in housing activity, resilient infrastructure investment, and better external demand,\" said Robin Xing, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley in Hong Kong. \"The strong growth and better external demand has provided room for a faster pace of countercyclical monetary policy tightening.\" \n\u2014 With assistance by Xiaoqing Pi Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

Time of Publication: 9:26 pm. 9:26 pm Facebook Streams a Murder, and Must Now Face Itself FACEBOOK \n[ UPDATE: 4/16/17 8:29 P.M. PST \u2014 Facebook has responded to various news reports, claiming that while Steve Stephens did post a Facebook Live at some point during the day, the shooting in question was not broadcast via Facebook Live. Rather, it was recorded and then uploaded. We\u2019ve clarified the story throughout to reflect the new information. ] \nThe video is shaky, like so many other handheld Facebook videos. A steering wheel fills the foreground, and a bright sunny day bobs by outside the car\u2019s windows. The man filming drives slowly, narrating as he goes. He isn\u2019t talking to just anyone, though anyone could be watching; he is talking to one woman, whom he blames for what\u2019s about to happen next. He stops the car. \u201cI found somebody I\u2019m \u2019bout to kill,\u201d he says, opening the door. \u201cI\u2019m \u2019bout to kill this guy right here, the old dude.\u201d A chime sounds, reminding him that he\u2019s left the keys in the ignition. He ignores it, and heads across the street to confront the man. Within seconds, one of the most horrific acts ever to appear on Facebook will be broadcast. A random murder, on Easter Sunday. \nThe entire video is 57 seconds long. Less than a minute: That\u2019s all it takes to broadcast a cold-blooded homicide to thousands of people around the world. And all it takes to raise questions about the limits and responsibilities of a platform that has pledged to reflect humanity in its purest form. \nWhen Facebook launched Facebook Live just under a year ago, Mark Zuckerberg told Buzzfeed that \u201cwe built this big technology platform so we can go and support whatever the most personal and emotional and raw and visceral ways people want to communicate are as time goes on.\u201d Well, Facebook Live has certainly succeeded in that effort, though some of that communication may be rawer and more visceral than the company had anticipated. Since its launch, Live has provided an unedited look at police shootings , rape , torture , and enough suicides that Facebook will be integrating real-time suicide prevention tools into the platform. And though murders have been captured by witnesses on Facebook Live\u2014and people have even been killed as they were streaming to the service\u2014this appears to be the first time a killer has streamed themselves preparing to commit a homicide, and then uploading the act itself, as happened earlier today. \nIn the video, a man that Cleveland police have identified as 37-year-old Steve Stephens gets out of his car and approaches an elderly shopper carrying a grocery bag. Stephens demands his target repeat a woman\u2019s name\u2014the woman who he is apparently making this video for. By this point the barrel of the gun is visible in the frame, and the victim senses that something is very wrong. As Stephens fires a single shot, the camera jostles away, so it actually misses the one moment he was seemingly so intent on capturing\u2014but when it pans back, his victim is lying in a pool of blood. \u201cThat motherfucker dead \u2019cause of you,\u201d Stephens concludes, addressing his intended audience. Homicide suspect Steve Stephens. Cleveland Police/AP \nIn a brief press conference held at 6pm CT\u2014broadcast on Facebook Live\u2014Cleveland police chief Calvin Williams claimed that, while Stephens had asserted that he had killed 13 people today, law enforcement officials had found no evidence of any other murders; Robert Godwin, 74, seems to be the only victim. Then again, when this article was published, Stephens was still at large, the subject of a massive manhunt by federal and state authorities. \u201cWe have brought everything to bear on this,\u201d Williams said. \u201cEverybody is out there looking for Steve.\u201d Presumably, when authorities do find Stephens, it will be in part because of clues embedded in the video he so freely shared: the make and model of his car; details of his physical appearance; what he\u2019s wearing. \nAnd when the manhunt is over, and the grieving begins, so too will Facebook\u2019s soul-searching. \nFacebook is not the first media company to struggle with the prospect of unwittingly broadcasting violence shortly after being uploaded. When news anchor Christine Chubbuck killed herself on live TV in 1974, the station was unable to stop the event from airing, but never showed the footage again. The number of viewers who actually saw the event was minimal. Facebook has taken similar steps, pulling Stephens\u2019 video shortly after it was posted. \u201cThis is a horrific crime and we do not allow this kind of content on Facebook,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cWe work hard to keep a safe environment on Facebook, and are in touch with law enforcement in emergencies when there are direct threats to physical safety.\u201d More Stories", "uuid": "f6ef590cffd1ba0e44f896d449506f6229484101", "entities": {"organizations": [], "persons": [], "locations": []}, "highlightTitle": ""}, {"published": "2017-04-17T05:02:00.000+03:00", "highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTUdeK56G.tyiB9DIr8dEt3M7qwCWnNJ0UFFLaBZz8ZHyOXB3GO3Aa3QTr8e2vZbK7hLL4h1lIcdI6_pyjOYK6T7oxtIk4LABzRvyBvp_I8hK_IK245rXXT", "thread": {"published": "2017-04-17T05:02:00.000+03:00", "spam_score": 0.0, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTUdeK56G.tyiB9DIr8dEt3M7qwCWnNJ0UFFLaBZz8ZHyOXB3GO3Aa3QTr8e2vZbK7hLL4h1lIcdI6_pyjOYK6T7oxtIk4LABzRvyBvp_I8hK_IK245rXXT", "site_full": "sputniknews.com", "domain_rank": 1616, "main_image": "https://cdn3.img.sputniknews.com/images/105269/99/1052699989.jpg", "replies_count": 0, "title": "Three US Aircraft Carriers Directed Toward South Korean Shores", "participants_count": 0, "section_title": "Sputnik International - Breaking News & Analysis - Radio, Photos, Videos, Infographics", "performance_score": 6, "site": "sputniknews.com", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 8}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"comments": 7, "shares": 664, "likes": 664}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}}, "uuid": "ba847f84ace327c996a3d3b5700a0d504e803b73", "site_section": "http://sputniknews.com//export/rss2/archive/index.xml", "country": "RU", "site_categories": [], "title_full": "Three US Aircraft Carriers Directed Toward South Korean Shores", "site_type": "news"}, "crawled": "2017-04-17T05:02:00.000+03:00", "rating": null, "title": "Three US Aircraft Carriers Directed Toward South Korean Shores", "language": "english", "author": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "text": "Three US Aircraft Carriers Directed Toward South Korean Shores \u00a9 Photo: Pixabay 28 21414 6 50 Amid mounting tensions in the East Asia, the Pentagon has directed three US aircraft carriers toward the Korean Peninsula, South Korean media reported quoting governmental sources. \nTOKYO (Sputnik) \u2014 Three US aircraft carriers, USS Carl Vinson, USS Ronald Reagan and USS Nimitz, will enter the Sea of Japan next week, Yonhap News Agency reported, citing a South Korean government source.

Even today, many countries depend heavily on inland water transport, especially for large and bulky cargo, as it is cheaper, more reliable and less polluting than transporting goods by road or rail. \nIndia has yet to develop this cheaper and greener mode of transportation. Goods still travel by congested road and rail networks, slowing the movement of cargo, adding to uncertainties, and increasing the costs of trade. So much so that logistics costs in India are estimated to account for as much as 18 percent of the country\u2019s GDP. \nUntil about a hundred years ago, the Ganga river, too, was a busy waterway. But with the coming of the railways, this watercourse fell into disuse. The Government of India is now reviving the Ganga watercourse \u2013 known as National Waterway 1 or NW1- to ferry cargo from the eastern seaport of Haldia to Varanasi, some 1,360 km inland. The waterway has the potential to emerge as the leading logistics artery for northern India. Freight movement on waterways across countries. (World Bank) \nThe waterway\u2019s stretch between Kolkata and Delhi passes through one of India\u2019s most densely populated areas. A sizeable forty percent of all India\u2019s traded goods either originate from this resource-rich region or are destined for its teeming markets. While the region is estimated to generate about 370 million tonnes of freight annually, only a tiny fraction of this - about 5 million tonnes - currently travels by water. \nCurrently, cargo from the Gangetic states of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh takes circuitous land routes to reach the sea ports of Mumbai in Maharashtra and Kandla in Gujarat, rather than going to the much-closer port at Kolkata. The development of NW1 will help these states direct some of their freight to the Kolkata-Haldia complex, making the movement of freight more reliable and reducing logistics costs significantly. \nThe World Bank is financing the development of the Ganga waterway with a loan of $ 375 million. The Capacity Augmentation of National Waterway 1 Project will help put in place the infrastructure and services needed to ensure that NW1 emerges as an efficient transport artery in this important economic region. \nOnce operational, the waterway will form part of the larger multi-modal transport network being planned along the river. It will link up with the Eastern Dedicated Rail Freight Corridor, as well as with the area\u2019s existing network of highways. This web of water, road and rail arteries will help the region\u2019s industries and manufacturing units switch seamlessly between different modes of transport as they send their goods to markets in India and abroad. Farmers in the agriculturally-rich Gangetic plain will also benefit, as the waterway opens up markets further afield. World Bank World Bank \nSetting up Navigational Infrastructure \nSince the absence of essential infrastructure such as cargo terminals and jetties has been one of the reasons for the slow development of water transport in the region, the Project will help establish six multi-modal freight terminals - at Varanasi, Ghazipur, Kalughat, Sahibgunj, Triveni and Haldia. In addition, five new Roll On-Roll Off (RO-RO) crossings at different locations will help trucks and other vehicles transfer from road to river and vice versa. The six new cargo terminals have the potential to evolve into thriving logistics hubs, providing jobs for thousands of people in one of the poorest and most populous parts of the country. The Project will also help set up a vessel repair and maintenance facility at Doriganj. \nIn addition, the Project will support the modernization of the ageing Farakka lock, built some 40 years ago. At present, vessels often have to wait for up to six hours to cross the lock; nor is two-way traffic possible through its narrow gates. To facilitate the faster and smoother passage of boats through the passage, the lock will not only be upgraded but a new lock will also be built, allowing barges to travel both upstream and downstream simultaneously. These improvements will dramatically reduce the time taken to cross the lock. \nFurthermore, the Project will help set up a state-of-the-art River Information System (RIS). Among its many benefits, the RIS will enable barge-operators and cargo-owners to track their vessels, locate berths in advance in terminals and better plan their logistics. To make navigation safe both day and night, the Project will help mark out the central channel for boats to ply in and install night navigation facilities. Besides, detailed protocols are being laid down for dealing with emergencies, including for tackling the spillage of oil from boats. \n\u2018Working with Nature\u2019 \nSince the Ganga occupies a special place in the social, cultural and environmental landscape of the country, the Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) has sought to adopt the least intrusive methods of making the river navigable. It has therefore followed the principle of \u2018working with nature\u2019 while planning the Ganga waterway. \nUnlike many of the world\u2019s major watercourses, the Ganga is a seasonal river that swells with the monsoon rains and recedes in the dry winters. While small boats can indeed ply along this seasonal river, large cargo barges need a minimum depth to sail in. Shipping on the Ganga has thus been limited by the varying depths of water found in the river. Currently, traffic is largely limited to the river\u2019s downstream stretch between Farakka and the Haldia where the water is deep enough - 2.5 m to 3.0 m - for boats to sail in throughout the year. \nTypically, making such a river navigable would call for large scale dredging of the riverbed to attain the depth needed by larger boats, especially for large barges carrying up to 2,000 tonnes of cargo. In the Ganga\u2019s case, special care has been taken to accommodate such vessels while keeping the need for dredging to the minimum. \nA 45 metre-wide channel has been earmarked in the river\u2019s deepest part, and the Least Available Depths (LAD) needed for navigation has been determined keeping in mind the need to reduce dredging. The channel\u2019s depth thus follows the river\u2019s natural gradient in different stretches and is sufficient to support the two-way movement of large barges. \nThese measures will reduce the need for dredging to just 1.5 percent of the river\u2019s annual silt load of 10-11 million cubic metres. Even this limited dredging will only be done when absolutely necessary and then too using modern, less intrusive technologies. Among these technologies is the proposed water injection method that will use water pressure to liquefy silt deposits and wash them away. The dense slurry that results will then be deposited - either naturally or through induced currents - into depressions along the riverbed, ensuring that sediments remain within the river\u2019s ecosystem. \nWhere large shoals and islands exist, temporary structures made of natural materials such as bamboo will be erected to channelize the water flow. These temporary structures \u2013 or \u2018 bandals \u2019 as they are known \u2013 will be especially erected near aquatic sanctuaries to protect the Ganga\u2019s diverse fauna. \nContracts will also be tailored to reduce the need for dredging. \nProtecting Aquatic Biodiversity \nIWAI is also ensuring that water traffic does not impact the two aquatic wildlife sanctuaries that fall along this stretch of the river -- the Kashi Turtle Sanctuary at Varanasi and the Vikramshila Dolphin Sanctuary at Bhagalpur. \nAs a first step, information about these protected aquatic habitats and other sensitive areas such as wetlands will be fed into the new River Information System being developed under the World Bank-supported Project. This will ensure that vessels plying in these areas comply with the operational framework that has been put into place for minimizing impacts in sensitive zones.

The latest local poll suggests that a run-off vote for the city's de-facto mayor on Wednesday is too close to call.\nThe run-off quickly became a continuation of a struggle that emerged in the initial vote , when moderates favoring a pluralistic society faced off against conservatives eager for Islam to dominate politics and society in Indonesia's huge capital city.\nFILE - Jakarta's Governor Basuki \"Ahok\" Tjahaja Purnama gestures inside the courtroom during his blasphemy trial in Jakarta, Indonesia, Jan. 3, 2017.\n\nViolence and protests marked campaigning before a three-way vote in February that left the current governor, Basuki \"Ahok\" Tjahaja Purnama, who is ethnically Chinese and a Christian, pitted against Anies Baswedan, who is Muslim. With only 164,255 votes separating the two, and third-place candidate Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono holding a 17-percent share of the vote, neither Purnama nor Baswedan won a majority, and a run-off was required. \nFILE - An election official explains to an elderly woman how to give her vote at a polling station in Jakarta, Feb. 15, 2017.\nThis stage of the campaign has been punctuated on social media by the frequent use of a word once heard only rarely in public discourse in Jakarta \u2014 \u201ckafir,\u201d or heathen, to describe Purnama and the voters supporting him, even those who are Muslim. Banners commanding \u201cDon't vote for a heathen\u201d hang throughout Jakarta, the capital of a Muslim-majority nation that recognizes all citizens' right to freedom of religion.\nThe change in the tone of the campaign reflects Baswedan's changing views. The former education minister in the government of President Joko Widodo has courted conservative and hard-line Muslims. While he once described the Defenders of Islam Front (FPI) as a radical group, photos of him with the FPI chairman taken in January remain popular on social media. After the first round of voting, local media reports said he suggested there may have been fraud at polling stations in predominantly ethnic-Chinese areas.\nAnies Baswedan (C) is seen with his wife Fery Farhati Ganis (L) and his daughter Mutiara Annisa Baswedan as he casts his ballot during an election for Jakarta's governor in Jakarta, February 15, 2017 in this photo taken by Antara Foto.\n\nBaswedan \u201chas changed his views very much on issues of pluralism and tolerance,\u201d said Sarah Shair-Rosenfield, an associate professor at the School of Politics and Global Studies at Arizona State University, who studies Indonesian elections.\n\u201cThe election, for many, seems like a sort of question for Jakarta \u2014 and perhaps to a wider extent for Indonesia \u2014 about whether or not it is acceptable to have a non-Muslim as governor of the country\u2019s largest city.\u201d\nPurnama, popular with middle-class residents for his work to curtail corruption and improve the quality of life, is a so-called \u201cdouble-minority\u201d in a majority-Muslim nation. He was accused of blasphemy, a criminal offense, last year, and his trial before a panel of judges continues; a verdict has been delayed until the day following the run-off vote. Purnama has apologized for his comments and denied any wrongdoing.\nProtests by hardliners against Purnama have left many \u201cconcerned about the future of pluralism in Indonesia,\u201d said Jeremy Menchick, an assistant professor at the Pardee School of Global Studies at Boston University, whose book Islam and Democracy in Indonesia: Tolerance without Liberalism was published last year. \u201cThere\u2019s also a perception that intolerance is winning.\u201d\nFILE - A Muslim man shouts slogans during a rally against Jakarta's minority Christian Governor Basuki \"Ahok\" Tjahaja Purnama demanding him to be sacked outside the parliament in Jakarta, Indonesia, Feb. 21, 2017.\n\nShair-Rosenfield suggested that while public support for groups such as the FPI fluctuates, \u201cit is a little concerning\u201d to see candidates who are \u201cwilling to make deals with hardliners.\u201d\nBoth academics said the race is close, a perception borne out by a survey conducted between March 31 and April 5 by Saiful Mujani Research and Consulting (SMRC). It puts Baswedan as the front-runner, based on 47.9 percent of the respondents saying they would vote for him. Purnama stood at 46.9 percent, and the survey noted that 5.2 percent of voters remained undecided.\n\u201cThe gap between them is too narrow, so we cannot say that Anies [Baswedan] is leading,\u201d SMRC researcher Deni Irfani said on Wednesday.\nAccording to the survey, 32.4 percent of Baswedan\u2019s voter base cited \u201csimilar religion\u201d as the reason they would vote for him. More than 40 percent of Purnama\u2019s base credited his track record in governing the city as the factor that earned their votes.\nA combination picture shows people raising their finger after voting during an election for Jakarta's governor in Jakarta, Indonesia February 15, 2017.\n\nLocal media have reported the Jakarta Military Command, the Jakarta police and the Jakarta Public Order Agency will have as many as 64,000 officers deployed for Wednesday's vote.\n\"Each polling station will be guarded by a police officer and an army officer,\" and other personnel will be stationed throughout the capital, the military commander of Jakarta, Major General Jaswandi, has told reporters.\nThis report originated with VOA Indonesia .", "uuid": "49de3dbbef70473908f967b3fa01db1fd09392b7", "entities": {"organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "islam front"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "boston university"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "school of politics"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "pardee school of global studies"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "jakarta military command"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "arizona state university"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "voa"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "jakarta public order agency"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "fpi"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "saiful mujani research and consulting"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "shair-rosenfield"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "anies baswedan"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "jaswandi"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "purnama"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "deni irfani"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "mutiara annisa baswedan"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "baswedan"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "sarah shair-rosenfield"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "basuki"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "tjahaja purnama"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "jeremy menchick"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "agus harimurti yudhoyono"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "joko widodo"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "fery farhati ganis"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "antara foto"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "jakarta"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "washington"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "purnama"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "muslim-majority"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "indonesia"}]}, "highlightTitle": ""}, {"published": "2017-04-17T02:08:48.000+03:00", "highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_.HGlZHWbGbjpKO17stI5E_6n.b0m6wxy3WZxHcMdydstBc1tO5Ff5yq96tmFRc_UtBt0OSAL6UbMbl1B8ckgL3htdCpjyLLBdjNl1Y5oE9y2vHyjIvVPLsmc8L3I64e7rYHaUrU0SGg--", "thread": {"published": "2017-04-17T02:08:48.000+03:00", "spam_score": 0.0, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_.HGlZHWbGbjpKO17stI5E_6n.b0m6wxy3WZxHcMdydstBc1tO5Ff5yq96tmFRc_UtBt0OSAL6UbMbl1B8ckgL3htdCpjyLLBdjNl1Y5oE9y2vHyjIvVPLsmc8L3I64e7rYHaUrU0SGg--", "site_full": "www.voanews.com", "domain_rank": 5139, "main_image": "https://gdb.voanews.com/67C3594F-30AD-411B-B995-6F1903E65342_mw1024_mh1024_r1_s.jpg", "replies_count": 0, "title": "Pakistan Arrests Woman Who Allegedly Wanted to Attack Christians for IS", "participants_count": 1, "section_title": "Voice of America", "performance_score": 7, "site": "voanews.com", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 2}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 774, "likes": 774}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}}, "uuid": "023626444a2bed721a1c27f6ab721ee3f5cc39a7", "site_section": "http://www.voanews.com/templates/Articles.rss?sectionPath=/english/news/middle-east", "country": "IT", "site_categories": [], "title_full": "Pakistan Arrests Woman Who Allegedly Wanted to Attack Christians for IS", "site_type": "news"}, "crawled": "2017-04-17T02:08:48.000+03:00", "rating": null, "title": "Pakistan Arrests Woman Who Allegedly Wanted to Attack Christians for IS", "language": "english", "author": "webdesk@voanews.com (Noor Zahid)", "ord_in_thread": 0, "text": "Pakistani authorities arrested a woman on Saturday on suspicion of planning to target Christian gatherings on Easter Eve in Lahore, the capital of Punjab province.\nPunjab\u2019s Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) said Noreen Laghari, a second year student at Pakistan's Liaquat University of Medical Science, returned from Syria with the intent of targeting minority Christians in Pakistan.\n\nLaghari had left her home in Pakistan for college in early February of this year and never returned home.\n\nOn Saturday, the country\u2019s security forces raided a suspected location in Lahore and rounded up four suspected Islamic State militants, including Laghari.\n\n\u201cI think the girl [Laghari] established contacts with them [IS militants] through social media.

risky in future unless authorities act quickly to cut the use of antibiotics in Australia, infectious disease experts warn. \nTheir warning was sparked by a woman who died in the United States after doctors were unable to find an antibiotic that could treat an infection she developed after breaking her leg. \nThe Australasian Society for Infections Diseases experts say the woman's death may herald a post-antibiotic era in which high-level antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is widespread, meaning disease-causing bacteria could become untreatable. Related reading Australia facing health threat from GPs 'over-prescribing antibiotics' The Australian government has committed $9.4 million to combat the growing issue of antimicrobial resistance in the population, which could have dire health consequences. \n\"Should this be the case, it would profoundly affect all areas of health care, and society,\" wrote the society's president Professor Cheryl Jones and her colleagues in the Medical Journal of Australia on Monday. \n\"Simple childhood infections would once again be life-threatening events, major surgery would be associated with high mortality, chemotherapy for cancer and organ transplantation would no longer be possible.\" \nAustralians are among the biggest users of antibiotics in the world. \nProf Jones and her colleagues argue that while some steps have been taken in Australia to reduce usage rates, more needs to be done to cut antibiotic use in humans and animals. \nThey want urgent priority given to the development of a co-ordinated approach targeting drivers of AMR, including the unrestrained use of antibiotics and the consumption of imported foods such as seafood and meat containing AMR organisms. \nProf Jones said the death of the woman in Nevada deeply alarmed her organisation and other experts around the world after it was reported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in January. \nThe woman had broken her thigh bone while travelling in India in 2016. \nShe was initially hospitalised and received antibiotics before returning to the US, where she developed systemic inflammatory response syndrome. \nHer doctors identified an infection that was resistant to multiple drugs and the woman died of untreatable septic shock. \nProf Jones and her colleagues wrote that infectious disease experts and Australian government officials are expected to begin work on drafting an action plan at the Australian AMR Summit in Melbourne in June.

Feeling some Easter vibes, Sarah Palin 's daughter posted a proud pic cradling her baby bump on Instagram earlier today. \nThe bumpin' snap features a profile shot of the personality, highlighting her growing belly. The photo of the expectant mother had the simple caption, \"3 weeks left.\" \nAs we all know, babies rarely come on their actual due date, which means Bristol and Dakota could be expecting an arrival from the stork at any moment! Photos A post shared by Bristol Meyer (@bsmp2) on Apr 16, 2017 at 1:05pm PDT \nThe former teen mom has been closely cataloging her third pregnancy for her 131K Instagram followers. Bristol has also made sure to post a plethora of pics of the couple's 1-year-old daughter, Sailor Grace Meyer , who was born on Dec. 23, 2015, and her 8-year-old son, Tripp , from a previous relationship with Levi Johnsto n. \nIn December 2016, Bristol and Dakota, who were married in June 2016, announced via an adorable photo that the family of four was going to become five. Six weeks ago, the couple also shared the news that they were having a baby girl on Instagram. They posted a sweet image of the two of them staring into each other's eyes holding a paddle that read, \"It's a girl!\" \nDespite a rocky past , things seem to be going swimmingly for the duo, who previously called off their engagement on May 18, 2015, just days before their wedding. \nLast December, Bristol penned an emotional blog post addressing her on-again and off-again status with her now-husband, a U.S. Marine vet who received a 2009 Medal of Honor. \"Dakota and I have been through trials in the public eye, and I am so thankful for where we are today,\" she wrote. \nBristol added that she'd wanted a third child despite all the backlash surrounding her previous two pregnancies. \"While pregnant with Sailor (under more unconventional circumstances) I always knew a third child someday would complete our family,\" she wrote. \n\"The family are extremely happy and looking forward to the blessed event and to their growing family,\" Palin's rep previously told E!

This might seem like a great money-saving idea, but there are some drawbacks you need to think about, as I explained in this valuable Tip . However, one drawback I haven't covered yet is a problem with cellphones themselves. How strong is your provider's cell signal INSIDE your home? \nDo your calls drop out, text messages get stuck and never send or perhaps your internet browsing slows to a crawl? I've heard of some people who have great reception in some rooms at home and virtually none in others. Someone else had excellent coverage with one provider, but then switched carriers for a new plan. Only then did she find out that her new phone rarely connected inside her home. If you are going to use your cellphone as your primary phone, you really need better reliability than that. \nSome buildings seem like they were designed to block your reception. It might be a particular room, a certain spot or anywhere you stand. There's not much you can do about poor reception when using your phone at the store or work, but at home, you don't have to put up with it. \nThat's why I researched ways you can actually boost your cellphone signal inside your home. With a stronger signal, you can feel free to walk from one room to another while talking or be confident that your text messages will actually send. Before you decide to dump your landline, see if these ideas will work for you to ensure you have dependable cell service at home.", "uuid": "87c1ba1099c73afbe41fc61cd94a5dec0c9d01a6", "entities": {"organizations": [], "persons": [{"sentiment": "neutral", "name": "antonio guille"}, {"sentiment": "neutral", "name": "komando"}], "locations": []}, "highlightTitle": ""}, {"published": "2017-04-17T00:35:09.000+03:00", "highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8fS.PpxCE87yKGMFBJ5_.m1Brx5RTp6CKaZhne5xZ9MOYnhqSR7gg8PkkEKWXbsssKMOjhCH1fAFyYLxbWJuBWYY1ihhC3Hq.2ZXGYOUNojt7gegpHQBfHSIi_ZIwvJLG7lSp2SAwjX89eUE94uMPzs9iLIPGqF_1lKF7xRfRs4RASe3GmJne1", "thread": {"published": "2017-04-17T00:35:09.000+03:00", "spam_score": 0.0, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8fS.PpxCE87yKGMFBJ5_.m1Brx5RTp6CKaZhne5xZ9MOYnhqSR7gg8PkkEKWXbsssKMOjhCH1fAFyYLxbWJuBWYY1ihhC3Hq.2ZXGYOUNojt7gegpHQBfHSIi_ZIwvJLG7lSp2SAwjX89eUE94uMPzs9iLIPGqF_1lKF7xRfRs4RASe3GmJne1", "site_full": "www.premiumtimesng.com", "domain_rank": 7198, "main_image": "http://media.premiumtimesng.com/wp-content/files/2017/01/elrufai-southern-kaduna-e1485101000951.jpg", "replies_count": 0, "title": "Gunmen attack Southern Kaduna community as El-Rufai launches operation to end violence", "participants_count": 1, "section_title": "Premium Times Nigeria", "performance_score": 7, "site": "premiumtimesng.com", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 757, "likes": 757}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}}, "uuid": "0e6cce3b69c9d432d90e393b53f49bfa6dd4e08d", "site_section": "http://www.premiumtimesng.com/feed", "country": "US", "site_categories": [], "title_full": "Gunmen attack Southern Kaduna community as El-Rufai launches operation to end violence", "site_type": "news"}, "crawled": "2017-04-17T00:35:09.000+03:00", "rating": null, "title": "Gunmen attack Southern Kaduna community as El-Rufai launches operation to end violence", "language": "english", "author": "Premium Times", "ord_in_thread": 0, "text": "Gov.

blocks by unlawful revenue collectors across the country. \nA statement issued by the Force spokesperson, Jimoh Moshood, in Abuja on Sunday, said that the Special X-Squad Teams of the Force had been deployed to begin the exercise on April 17. \nMr. Moshood said the exercise would remove obstructions on public highways and roads mounted by unlawful revenue and tax collectors including the transport union, NURTW. \nMr. Moshood said the X-Squad reams were under strict instructions to also arrest, investigate and prosecute any person or group of persons found committing this illegal act. \n\u201cIt is unlawful and contrary to the laws for any individual, or group under any name to take laws into their hands and block any road or highway under the guise of collection of Revenue/Tax,\u201d he said. \nHe advised all relevant state and local government councils, as well as boards of internal revenue services across the country to desist from the acts as it was against the laws of the nation. \nThe spokesperson said that these illegal road blocks were most times taken over and used by armed robbers and kidnappers to rob, kidnap and maim innocent travellers and other road users. \nHe warned that anyone arrested in the act would be prosecuted along with their sponsors. \n\u201cParents and guardians are also enjoined to monitor their children and wards not to be used to commit illegal acts under the pretence of employment. \n\u201cThe renewed commitment of the Nigeria Police Force to continue to enforce the law, guarantee adequate security and safety of every

Image: AP/REX/Shutterstock \nIf you said his Mar-a-Lago estate, there's a 54 percent chance you're right and the Center For American Progress (CAP) is keeping track of all kinds of numbers related to Trump's frequent Florida fly-away weekends. Why is @BarackObama always campaigning or on vacation? \n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 17, 2011 \nThe site \u2014 Is Trump At Mar-a-Lago? \u2014 tracks not only whether or not Trump is spending the weekend at the estate but also how much money it's costing taxpayers. \nAnd to twist the knife a little, it also calculates what that money could be used for instead of Trump's weekends away, focusing on programs that are under the knife from the Trump administration. @BarackObama , the habitual vacationer, should read #TimeToGetTough during his upcoming 17 day Hawaii vacation. \n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2011 \nFor instance, according to the CAP, the $25 million reportedly spent thus far on Mar-a-Lago trips (including Easter weekend) could buy 9,000 meals for Meals on Wheels. Or it could fund 7,000 Pell Grants a year. Why was the Hanukah celebration held in the White House two weeks early? @BarackObama wants to vacation in Hawaii in late December. Sad. \n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 9, 2011 \nWhile we're not yet even at the milestone 100 Day mark for the Trump presidency, one of the (many, many) eye-opening things about Trump's tenure thus far is the large amount spent on time away from the White House. \nAs for CAP's number of $25 million thus far, it should come with a grain of salt. They cite the U.S. Government Accountability Office as their source. The GAO is currently investigating the long-term costs at the request of a group of Democratic senators, including Elizabeth Warren (D-MA). The habitual vacationer, @BarackObama , has sacrificed so much. He is delaying his 17 day Hawaii vacation a couple of hours. \n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 14, 2011 \nMuch has been made in the media recently about Trump being on pace to spend in one year what President Obama spent on travel over his entire eight years in office. With a record deficit and $15 trillion in debt, @BarackObama is spending $4 million of our money on his Hawaii vacation. Just plain wrong. \n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 19, 2011 \nBut those numbers also deserve some skepticism. Most media reports , including CAP's numbers, are all based on a previous GAO report on the cost for a 2013 trip by then-president Barack Obama to Chicago and Palm Springs, which was pegged at $3.6 million. The Obama's Spain vacation cost taxpayers over $476K http://t.co/W6kIpd5x They love to spend money. \n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 27, 2012 \nDo a little math \u2014 seven Trump trips in three months works out to 28 trips over a year, times $3.6 million a trip using that Obama GAO report\u2014 and you get over $100 million, a number that surpasses the $96 million that the conservative group Judicial Watch reported Obama spent on time off during his entire time in the White House. Pres. Obama is about to embark on a 17 day vacation in his \u2018native\u2019 Hawaii, putting Secret Service away from families on Christmas. Aloha! \n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 19, 2013 \nBut that's assuming each Trump trip to Mar-a-Lago costs the same as that Obama trip, which likely isn't the case since the trips aren't exactly the same. Judicial Watch puts the number for each Trump trip much lower than what's being reported, at around $1 million a trip . \nBut we won't know until the GAO reports its findings. Secret Service members on break from Obama\u2019s $4M vacation are more than welcomed to relax at Hawaii\u2019s top hotel @TrumpWaikiki . \n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 20, 2013 \nWhatever the cost ultimately turns out to be, there's no denying that spending 7 of 13 weekends in Florida is a steep ratio, even if a few of those trips were \"business.\" Factor in other costs, including those incurred in protecting First Lady Melania Trump and First Kid Barron Trump who are still currently in New York City, and, yeah, it seems that a hefty chunk of change is being spent by the Trump White House. It's Jan. 2. President Obama should end his vacation early & get back to Washington to straighten out the ObamaCare catastrophe\u2014or end it. \n\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2014 \nAt least at a time when the Trump administration is facing criticism for these costs while also proposing a budget that significantly slashes many beloved programs (like the aforementioned Meals On Wheels ), it won't be haunted by a track record of attacks on a previous president for his vacation time.

And the second part of this famous name needs no telling. But Sachin is more than just the name of a person, it is also the name of a former princely state. Located close to Surat, it has an unusual history. A history that bears remembering in the light of recent events targeting Africans in India. India\u2019s African-ruled kingdoms Founded in 1791, Sachin was one of the many princely states in the Gujarat region. A mere 127 sq. km in area and with a population of a little more than 20,000, it did not quite capture the imagination like Hyderabad or Mysore. But a minor detail about the ethnicity of its nawab is of particular interest. The nawabs of Sachin were of Ethiopian (Abyssinian) descent\u2014Siddis, in the local parlance. Tracing their ancestry back to the soldiers who were part of Babur\u2019s invading army, it is no small wonder that these descendants of ordinary soldiers rose to such prominence that they could actually rule over not one, but two kingdoms in the region, both of which survived up to Independence. Further south from Sachin, off the coast of Raigad, is the island of Janjira. This island, along with a couple of other mainland areas constituted the kingdom of Janjira again ruled by Siddis of African descent. Bigger than Sachin in area (830 sq. km) and population (110,000), Janjira was sizeable enough and powerful enough to actually have a vassal state\u2014Jafrabad in the Kathiawar peninsula. Founded in 1489 by an African trader, Janjira was for a long time in the 15th and 16th centuries a vassal of the Bijapur sultanate. Ottoman Turk records mention that the combined forces of the Ottomans and Janjira routed a Portuguese fleet off Yemen in 1589. There are other mentions too of Ottoman-Janjira cooperation\u2014an indication that the state and its rulers counted for something in medieval times. Later, the Mughals become the overlords of this kingdom. Following the waning influence of the Mughals in 18th century, the state allied with Jafrabad in 1759 before entering into an alliance with the British in 1799. That Janjira and Sachin were able to exist as independent kingdoms owes something to a formidable personality called Malik Ambar (1548-1626). The remarkable career of Malik Ambar Born in Ethiopia and sold into slavery at a young age, Malik rose to a prominent position in the Ahmadnagar sultanate. While we do know that as a child, Malik was first sold to an individual in Yemen, moved to Baghdad, then Mecca and finally ended up in or around Ahmadnagar, the finer details of his rise are lost in the sands of time. Interestingly though, his rise echoes the rise of the eunuch slave, Malik Kafur (?-1316) in the time of Ala-ud-din Khilji. A popular prime minister, Malik Ambar maintained a force of 3,000 men and fought off the mighty Mughals and curbed their desire to incorporate the Deccan into their growing empire. Like Shivaji who came after him, he did so by engaging the Mughals in guerilla warfare. A painting of the time shows Jahangir taking aim at Malik Ambar\u2019s head, which indicates that he was quite a thorn in the Mughals\u2019 side. Towards the end of his life, however, Malik Ambar chose to ally with the Mughals. The fort of Janjira was a Malik Ambar construction. It was a fort that Shivaji attempted to occupy, but was fought off by troops under the Siddi ruler of Janjira. Malik Ambar also founded the town of Khirki which later rose to prominence under Aurangazeb and was renamed Aurangabad. Africans in medieval India History records two other areas in India which were for a time under rulers of African descent. Adoni in the Rayalseema region of Andhra Pradesh was under an African dynasty began by an Abyssinian merchant, Siddi Masood Khan. The dynasty ruled from roughly around 1565-70 till 1686. Nominally part of the Bijapur sultanate, it came to an end when Aurangzeb defeated the sultanate. An Abyssinian by the name of Barbak Shahzada laid the foundation stone of the Habshi dynasty in Bengal in 1487, and became its first ruler under the name of Ghiyath-al-Din Firuz Shah. Overcome in 1493, the Habshis of Bengal left behind one prominent monument, the Firuz Minar in Gaur in today\u2019s Malda district, bordering Bangladesh. By 1493, the Habshi sultans had been knocked off their perch by other contenders to the throne. But much before the nawabs of Sachin, Janjira, the rulers of Adoni and Bengal and Malik Ambar himself lived Jamal-ud-din Yaqut, who briefly shot to prominence in the time of Razia Sultana (1236-1240). An Abyssinian slave, he rose through the ranks, found favour with Razia and became her close adviser. Rumours abounded in Razia\u2019s court that Yaqut was her lover too. These rumours eventually resulted in a rebellion in which Yaqut was killed. In a remarkable twist, Razia went on to marry Altunia, the leader of the rebellion. Later still, Razia and Altunia were killed by Razia\u2019s brother, Bahram Shah, another claimant to the throne. Yaqut today lives on as one character in an interesting tale of love and revenge, but clearly, he was much more than that. To rise to such prominence albeit briefly would not have been possible unless he was a person of remarkable ability. Modern-day Indians of African descent Besides the descendants of the Nawabs of Sachin and Janjira, another present-day interesting African-Indian connection is in the form of the Siddis found mostly in Karnataka and Gujarat. Bantu by origin and descended from soldiers of armies of yore and escaped slaves who founded communities in remote forested areas, the Siddis today constitute a distinct community in these two states. Most Indian Siddis are Muslim or Christian, while a small number have adopted Hindu practices. The Siddis of Gujarat have adopted many local customs, but have retained the drumming and dance forms of their African ancestors. Some Gujarati Siddis look upon Malik Ambar as a patron saint of the community. The Siddis of Karnataka are largely to be found in the north-western parts of the state, bordering Goa. Like the Siddis of Gujarat, they too have adopted many local customs. Besides these two communities, a small community of African descent is also to be found in the city of Hyderabad, descended from guards employed by the erstwhile Nizam of Hyderabad. In Pakistan, Siddis (Sheedis in the local parlance) are to be found in Karachi and the Makran coast of Balochistan. The Sheedis are divided into four clans, or houses: Kharadar Makan, Hyderabad Makan, Lassi Makan and Belaro Makan. The Sufi saint Pir Mangho is regarded by many as the patron saint of the Sheedis. The attacks on African in recent times are in stark contrast to the historical ties that bind Africa and India. It is a history that has slipped under the surface, but worth reclaiming given recent events. Karthik Venkatesh is an editor with a publishing firm and a freelance writer. Views are personal.

That sets it up to beat \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens,\u201d whose 2015 international release brought in $529 million, according to ComScore Inc. \nThe car-chase film\u2019s international debut was four times bigger than the opening of an estimated $100 million in the U.S. and Canada. The film benefited from opening in China in its first weekend, while \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d didn\u2019t premiere in that country until a month after its first global release, said Paul Dergarabedian, a media analyst at ComScore. And while the Star Wars movie brought in more than double what \u201cThe Fate\u201d did domestically in its first weekend, it\u2019s overseas opening was was more in line with its sales at home. \nIn China, where the franchise has a huge fan base, \"The Fate\" fetched the highest ever three-day opening weekend, grossing 1.3 billion yuan ($190 million), almost double the size of North America opening, according to Universal. That\u2019s also the fastest a film has ever passed the 1 billion yuan mark - threshold to a hit film in China. Previous record-holder, \"The Mermaid,\" took four days to reach that mark, considered the threshold for a hit film. \n\u201cIt\u2019s just amazing how well-received this franchise is all over the world,\u201d especially in China, said Paul Sweeney, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \u201cIt\u2019s a franchise that kind of sneaks up on people -- they don\u2019t necessarily think about it in the same breath as Star Wars or other bigger franchises. But this is the eighth installment and every single one has been just exceptionally successful.\u201d \n\u201cThe Fate\u201d was the only new release of the weekend. The movie had been estimated to open at $118 million to $127 million in North America, according to analysts at BoxOfficePro.com and Hollywood Stock Exchange . \nTwentieth Century Fox \u2019s animated \u201cThe Boss Baby\u201d returned in second place with $15.5 million, missing a forecast of $15.8 million, according to BoxOfficePro.com. Walt Disney Co. \u2019s live action adaptation \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d added an estimated $13.6 million to the $1 billion it has generated in ticket sales globally. It was forecast to place third and add $14 million, according to the analysts. The most important business stories of the day. Get Bloomberg's daily newsletter. Sign Up \nThe success of \u201cThe Fate\u201d proves Comcast Corp.\u2019s Universal can continue to count on Vin Diesel and his crew of gearheads to produce reliable hits, even without one of the lead actors, Paul Walker, who died during production of the previous \u201cFurious 7\u201d film. While Hollywood has been dominated more and more by superhero movies, \u201cThe Fast and The Furious\u201d has been able to carve out a niche in the action genre with a diverse cast that has appealed to a global audience. At least two more movies are planned. \nFate of the Furious Source: Universal Studios \nThe new picture is the costliest so far, with a budget of $250 million, according to Box Office Mojo, almost double the cost of some of the earlier installments. It opened in about 4,300 theaters, which the studio described as the widest non-summer release in North America and its most ambitious. \nBefore \u201cThe Fate of the Furious\u201d was released, the series had already generated $3.9 billion globally, according to Box Office Mojo. \u201cFurious 7,\u201d which reaped $147 million in North America in its opening weekend, still ranks as the biggest April debut on record and the sixth-highest-grossing movie worldwide of all time. \nF. Gary Gray, whose credits include the surprise hit \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d for Universal Pictures, directs a cast that includes Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham and several other returning actors reprising their roles, including Chris \u201cLudacris\u201d Bridges. Charlize Theron and Helen Mirren joined the line-up for the first time. \nThe film has the usual elaborate car chases, this time through the streets of Cuba and across a frozen lake. It was the first major Hollywood picture to shoot in Cuba for more than 60 years, according to the studio. Diesel reprises the role of car racer Dominic, now married and retired. But Dom encounters a villain named Cipher (played by Theron) who tries to seduce him into a world of crime, setting the team up for a new fight. \nThe feature scored 65 percent positive reviews, according to aggregator Rottentomatoes.com.

A United crew who won\u2019t accept TSA\u2019s judgment that the device should be allowed on the plane. A honeymoon hampered-and a looming threat of arrest. That\u2019s the story told by Trey Harris , who describes himself as a former worker at both Google and Amazon . Harris suffers from spondylitis, a spinal condition which makes it difficult to walk. He uses a Segway miniPro to make life easier, and wanted to take the device with him on a March honeymoon cruise with his new husband. Get Data Sheet , Fortune \u2019s technology newsletter. He was well aware that the Segway could be a red flag for airlines, especially given recent safety concerns around so-called hoverboards. So he talked to both the TSA and United\u2019s own Special Needs desk before the trip. Both said that the Segway was safe, and United placed a notification on his itinerary about the device. Things seemed to be going according to plan on the day of the flight, as Harris and his Segway made it through airport security without issues. But when he reached the gate, Harris says United staff told him he couldn\u2019t board with the device. According to Harris\u2019s telling, they ignored both TSA\u2019s recommendation that the device was safe, and renewed assurances from United\u2019s own Special Needs representative. Ultimately, Harris claims he was forced to abandon the Segway, with United telling him he couldn\u2019t even gate-check it as cargo. Without his Segway, Harris was stuck with a much less convenient rented scooter, which kept him from fully enjoying his honeymoon cruise, and was occasionally dangerous. He insists he still had a great time, though, and isn\u2019t looking for compensation from United-\u201cnot even for the scooter rental.\u201d That\u2019s pretty magnanimous of him-especially considering that things somehow got even worse. In the middle of the cruise, Harris says he got a series of voicemails saying that he had abandoned a hazardous item at an airport-that is, the Segway. He was told he could face both criminal charges and fees for the disposal of the device. Ultimately, Harris wasn\u2019t arrested when he made it home, and he even got his Segway back. But, he says he hasn\u2019t heard anything from United, even after sending a followup letter about the incident. We\u2019ve reached out to United for comment, and will update this story with any response to Harris\u2019s story.

Once implemented, Erdogan will have authority to appoint ministers and top judges at his discretion and call elections at any time. It will also give him much greater sway over fiscal policy and may deepen investors\u2019 concerns about the independence of the central bank.\nThe win \u201crepresents a blow to the assumption that liberal or even in some cases hybrid democracies are structured to prevent authoritarian figures from hijacking the political system,\u201d Anthony Skinner, a director with U.K.-based forecasting company Verisk Maplecroft, said before the results were declared.\nErdogan triumphed by appealing to voters in the small towns that dot the Anatolian heartland where he won overwhelmingly . These Turks want a firm hand at the helm to combat the resurgence of terrorism, fight Kurdish separatism and Islamic State in Syria and defend Turkey\u2019s global interests. The result is a victory not only for him, but for type of authoritarian system exemplified by Vladimir Putin that has gained admirers around the world.\n\u201cWe want foreign countries and institutions to respect the decision of our nation,\u201d Erdogan said in a victory speech from a mansion in Turkey\u2019s largest city Istanbul, where supporters chanted that he should bring back the death penalty.\nIstanbul Against Support in urban centers was much weaker. The nation\u2019s largest city Istanbul, where the ruling Justice and Development (AK) party Erdogan founded has never lost a general election, rejected it by 51 percent. So did Turks in the capital city Ankara and more secular coastal towns along the Aegean Sea, like Izmir. Voter turnout was 87 percent among the 58 million Turks eligible to cast ballots, according to projections.\nTurkey\u2019s main opposition party, CHP, has already said it would demand a recount of about 37 percent of ballots. Erdal Aksunger, the CHP\u2019s deputy head, said Anadolu was \u201cmanipulating\u201d results as it announced them.\nWhile narrow, the victory is a remarkable turnaround for a president who just nine months ago faced down an attempted military coup. The uprising was quickly crushed and, armed with a popular mandate to consolidate his rule, Turkey\u2019s leader of 14 years now has room to crack down further on his opponents. In the nine months since imposing a state of emergency, he\u2019s already fired more than 100,000 people and jailed 40,000, among them academics, journalists and judges.\nPrime Minister Binali Yildirim called the win the \u2018\u2018the best answer\u2019\u2019 to foes including the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which is waging an insurgency in southeast Turkey, and sympathizers of Fethullah Gulen, an influential U.S.-based Islamic preacher Erdogan blames for orchestrating the coup attempt. The struggle against \u201cinternal and external enemies will intensify,\u201d he said.\nThe 18 amendments to the constitution approved on Sunday include:\nAbolishing the post of prime minister Removing the requirement for presidential neutrality, which allows Erdogan to reinstate his affiliation with the ruling AK party Enabling the president to stand in two five-year election cycles, and a third with parliamentary backing Allowing the president to appoint six of a whittled-down panel of 13 top judges, with others chosen by lawmakers The constitutional changes mean Erdogan could potentially hold the reins until 2029, a decade longer than the rule of Ataturk, the father of the modern secular nation that he has sought to roll back. Opposition politicians worry the new system will threaten the separation of powers on which liberal democracies traditionally rely.\nMarket analysts predict the victory will usher in a period of greater predictability and could lure back a bit of the foreign investment that\u2019s fled the country in recent years. The lira will probably advance 2 to 3 percent in the next month, according to UBS AG projections before the tally.\nStill, one reason the currency slumped by half in the past four years was Erdogan\u2019s propensity to meddle in central bank policy by pushing for lower borrowing costs, a concern that won\u2019t go away as interest rates climb. Turkey lost its investment-grade standing last year and growth rates are among the slowest of the century as tourism suffers under the weight of terror attacks.\n\u201cFrom a market perspective this is the best they could have hoped for: An Erdogan win, but only just,\u201d said Timothy Ash, a senior emerging-market sovereign strategist at Bluebay Asset Management LLP in London.\nRedrawing Alliances Beyond Turkey\u2019s Black Sea shores, Erdogan\u2019s next task will be to reassess political alliances. During the campaign, a diplomatic row erupted between Turkey and European Union countries like the Netherlands that prevented Turkish ministers from lobbying the diaspora, a decision Erdogan denounced as Nazi-like.\nKeep up with the best of Bloomberg Politics.

Several Turkish officials said they\u2019d press the EU harder for things like visa-free travel to citizens in exchange for upholding a critical deal on halting the flow of migrants to Europe. U.S. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, needs the support of Turkey, a NATO member, if he\u2019s serious about taking on Islamic State in Syria.\nErdogan will probably try to start a \u201ccharm offensive\u201d toward to the EU and U.S. to validate the legitimacy of the new political system, said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli, the office director in Ankara for German Marshall Fund of the United States, a global think tank.\n\u201cIf reciprocated he may reverse some of the democratic backsliding we have seen recently. However, if the charm offensive is not reciprocated we could see decisions such as reinstating of death penalty which would further and probably institutionally weaken Turkey\u2019s ties with Europe,\" he said before the vote.\nOne-Man Rule In his expanded role, Erdogan will become one of the G-20\u2019s most powerful elected leaders. By channelling nationalist sentiment and slamming segments of Turkey\u2019s older political elite, Erdogan tapped into the same forces that powered Trump to the White House, pushed Britain out of the EU and put Marine Le Pen within shouting distance of the French presidency.\nHis win is also part of a trend toward a more authoritarian style of politics mirroring Putin\u2019s Russia or Xi Jinping\u2019s China, where more and more power is accumulated around one person.\nFor Erdogan, it\u2019s a culmination of a years-long effort to consolidate power. It intensified in mid-2013 with anti-government protests that revealed cracks in the popularity that helped the AKP win consecutive parliamentary elections starting in 2003.\nWithin months, he\u2019d quashed a corruption probe targeting his government by purging police and judges he accused of being sympathizers of Gulen. Since winning the presidency in 2014 and turning what was a largely ceremonial role into a nexus of authority, Erdogan has taken an even harder line against critics.\nSome of the approved amendments -- like the abolition of high military courts -- have immediate effect, with others enacted after elections scheduled for 2019, unless they\u2019re called earlier.\n\u201cThe approved constitutional changes will institutionalize a populist one-man system equipped with vast additional powers,\u201d said Wolfango Piccoli, the London-based co-president of Teneo Intelligence, a political risk advisory firm. \u201cThere is also a considerable risk that the further consolidation of power under Erdogan will increase the volatility of the domestic political and societal backdrop.\u201d", "uuid": "760e1ff3537e8b4c3e47a2f4b2ac6be94a185715", "entities": {"organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "bloomberg"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "teneo intelligence"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "justice and development"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "istanbul against support"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "bloomberg politics"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "high election board"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "anadolu"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "chp"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "tayyip erdogan"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "erdogan"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "wolfango piccoli"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "anadolu"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "erdal aksunger"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "turkey"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "izmir"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ankara"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "aegean sea"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "istanbul"}]}, "highlightTitle": ""}, {"published": "2017-04-16T21:12:17.000+03:00", "highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.rov49A_pw5LQgPD5FV2E30KyIJh.PzWRYfCfKDxsoxmtXs8AWKtLIOYfTOODl1jZweMvw3m5ih6hRoMf5LNUonMnJiZGM_Z8I4xcOBL4TQ7YDl_1C5vI7AbqZOZWU2iBRup2RXbPJ5mpGH3YJmKce", "thread": {"published": "2017-04-16T21:12:17.000+03:00", "spam_score": 0.0, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.rov49A_pw5LQgPD5FV2E30KyIJh.PzWRYfCfKDxsoxmtXs8AWKtLIOYfTOODl1jZweMvw3m5ih6hRoMf5LNUonMnJiZGM_Z8I4xcOBL4TQ7YDl_1C5vI7AbqZOZWU2iBRup2RXbPJ5mpGH3YJmKce", "site_full": "www.eonline.com", "domain_rank": 770, "main_image": "http://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2017316/rs_600x600-170416103928-600.teen-moms.cm.41617.jpg?downsize=450:*&crop=450:350;left,top", "replies_count": 0, "title": "Farrah Abraham Say She \"Made More Views and Ratings Than All 3 Stooges on Teen Mom\"", "participants_count": 0, "section_title": "E!

He has in recent days criticized members of the press he says \" lauded \" Trump's actions. \n\"Dropping bombs, having missile strikes, doesn't make one presidential,\" Rather said. \nInstead, Rather said Trump should be judged on his ability to \"keep the peace.\" He described countries like North Korea, Syria, Iraq and Yemen as \"flashpoints\" that are \"real powder kegs with a real short fuse burning.\" \nRelated: Trump is dialing back his economic promises.

He said the action in Syria took attention away from stories about Russia's influence on the election, whether it was intended to do so or not. \n\"Journalists have a tendency to rally around powder kegs. What's best for the country is for journalists to be skeptical,\" he said. \"Not cynical, but skeptical.\" \nRather was the anchor and managing editor of \"CBS Evening News\" for more than two decades. He now hosts an interview series on AXS TV and runs a production company. \nIn the interview, Rather acknowledged his own shortcomings, saying that he did not ask \"enough of the right questions\" before the Bush administration invaded Iraq in 2003. Other prominent journalists have expressed similar regrets. \n\"I think we need to remind ourselves of that today,\" Rather said. \nRelated: Dan Rather: 'We are a deeply divided country' \nIt's not the first time Rather has weighed in on the media's coverage of Trump. \nRather has used Facebook ( FB , Tech30 ) as a platform to criticize the way some outlets report on Trump's false statements . During the campaign, he also challenged reporters to not cover Trump like a \"normal\" presidential nominee .

By: PTI | Published: April 16, 2017 10:05 PM The Telangana legislature today passed a bill which raises substantially the reservation for backward Muslims and scheduled tribes, taking the total quotas in government jobs and educational institutions much beyond the 50 per cent limit. (Source: PTI) \nThe Telangana legislature today passed a bill which raises substantially the reservation for backward Muslims and scheduled tribes, taking the total quotas in government jobs and educational institutions much beyond the 50 per cent limit set by the Supreme Court. The Telangana Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes (Reservation of Seats in Educational Institutions and of Appointments or Posts in the Services under the State) Bill, 2017, was passed by the two houses of the legislature on a Sunday amid protest by five BJP MLAs, who were suspended for the day. Barring the BJP, all other parties backed the bill. \nThe new legislation envisages raising reservation for socially and educationally backward Muslims from the existing four to 12 per cent and for Scheduled Tribes from six to 10 per cent. With this, the total quota in the state has gone up to 62 per cent from 50 per cent, which is the ceiling prescribed by the Supreme Court. \u201cThe poorer sections of Muslims have already been getting 4 per cent reservation under the Backward Classes (E) category. After the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh, population percentage of Muslims in Telangana has shot up and 90 per cent of them are poor and socially backward. Hence, we have decided to increase reservation for them treating them as OBC,\u201d Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao told the assembly. \nSpeaker Madhusudanachari suspended all five BJP MLAs as they protested carrying placards and sporting black scarves, calling the bill \u201cunconstitutional\u201d as it provided for quotas based on religion. The lone BJP member in the Legislative Council, Ramachandra Rao, staged a walkout. The BJP MLAs, however, said they supported the increase in quotas for the STs. It will now be sent for the President\u2019s assent, Rao said. He said if the Centre did not include the bill in the 9th schedule of the Constitution which will preclude a judicial review, the state government will approach the Supreme Court for a direction to the Union government. \nYou might also want to see this: \n\u201cWhy can\u2019t Muslims be given reservations? Are they sinners? They constitute one-fifth of the population of this country\u2026.Don\u2019t they pay taxes? Are they not citizens of India?\u201d he asked. \u201cI am not going to beg the Centre (for assent). I am going to fight for it, if required. If the Centre does not come forward (to facilitate assent for the bill), we will raise the issue in the Parliament,\u201d Rao said. Increasing reservation for Muslims was TRS\u2019 election promise and the people of the state had endorsed it, Rao said. Congress leader T Jeevan Reddy backed the bill, but said the state government must ensure its inclusion in the 9th schedule of the Constitution. \nBJP floor leader G Kishan Reddy said reservation for Muslims was not justified as there was no caste-based discrimination in Islam. He also said quotas for Muslims was \u201cun-Islamic\u201d. \u201cAny reservation for Muslims is un-Islamic. Dr B R Ambedkar also opposed reservations based on religion. 94 per cent of Muslim community in the state is covered by the new reservation. This would be a historic blunder of this government,\u201d Reddy said. Meanwhile, police detained BJP workers in various parts of the city as they tried to march towards the Assembly.

By: IANS | Published: April 16, 2017 9:11 PM A day after Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel\u2019s purported disinterest in expanding business to \u201cpoor countries\u201d like India created controversy in social media, parent company Snap Inc denied the allegation, saying no such remark was made, reports said on Sunday. (Source: IE) \nA day after Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel\u2019s purported disinterest in expanding business to \u201cpoor countries\u201d like India created controversy in social media, parent company Snap Inc denied the allegation, saying no such remark was made, reports said on Sunday. US-based news website Variety on Saturday quoted Snapchat\u2019s ex-employee Anthony Pompliano as saying that Spiegel in September 2015 told him that \u201cthe app is only for rich people. I don\u2019t want to expand into poor countries like India and Spain\u201d. But the company denied the remarks reports of which had resulted in the rating of the popular app dropping to a \u201csingle star\u201d from an apparent \u201cfive star\u201d on the App Store. \n\u201cThe simple fact is that he (Pompliano) knows exactly nothing about Snap\u2019s current metrics. He and his lawyers are \u2014 not to put too fine a point on matters \u2014 just making things up,\u201d Variety reported Snap\u2019s attorneys as saying. Denying the claims of Snapchat being termed as a \u2018rich people\u2019s app\u2019, the attorneys termed Pompliano a \u201cdisgruntled employee fired for poor performance\u201d. \nThe portal YourStory published an official statement from Snap that said: \u201cThis is ridiculous. Obviously Snapchat is for everyone! It\u2019s available worldwide to download for free.\u201d Meanwhile, the rating of the popular app dropped to a \u201csingle star\u201d from \u201cfive star\u201d on the App Store. According to the app info on App Store, the \u201cCustomer Ratings\u201d of the current version of the app was \u201csingle star\u201d (based on 6,099 ratings) and all versions\u2019 rating was \u201cone and half star\u201d (based on 9,527 ratings) as on Sunday morning. \nThe rating for the app on Android Play Store was \u201cfour star\u201d (based on 11,932,996 ratings). Indians did not take the comment lightly and took to social media to lash out at the statement from the CEO. As the ratings of the app dropped, the criticism of the CEO and the app increased. \u201cFirst of all, I didn\u2019t even want to give any freakin\u2019 star to this app. Evan (CEO of Snapchat) shows how stupid he is by saying this. I bet 3/4th of his company is run by Indian employees. If he didn\u2019t want to expand it to poor countries, then why is this app free? Why didn\u2019t he put any charges on it?\u201d a user wrote on App Store, condemning the CEO. \nSome users wrote, \u201cPoor India & Spain need better than Snapchat\u201d, \u201cGood bye, My Snapchat Account and Snap Inc. You\u2019ll be product of gone by era and derision\u201d, and \u201cPoor Evan Spiegel\u201d. The app was also trolled on Twitter. #boycottsnapchat became the most trending hashtag on Twitter overnight. \nYou might also want to see this: \n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen any Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians etc Tweets yet. Thanks @Snapchat for Uniting us,\u201d a user tweeted. \u201cI was addicted to @Snapchat but I love my country more than this app. Let\u2019s see how you earn without Indians. @evanspiegel #boycottsnapchat,\u201d another user wrote on twitter. \nSome users even flagged the app for hateful content and left a message, \u201cDear @snapchatsupport, flagged you for hateful content. #boycottsnapchat\u201d. According to a report in Forbes on Thursday, Facebook\u2019s photo-sharing app Instagram surpassed Snapchat in daily active users of \u201cStories\u201d feature, though the format was first launched by Snapchat in 2013. Instagram\u2019s \u201cStories\u201d feature was now used by more than 200 million people every day \u2014 an increase of 50 million since January. \nOn the other hand, Snapchat which launched the \u201cStories\u201d format in October 2013, had 161 million daily active users in February. \u201cStories\u201d feature is an ephemeral chain of photo and video clips with filters and special effects. More recently, Facebook and WhatsApp also introduced the feature, imitating Snapchat. Snapchat has more than four million users in India.

By: ANI | Uttar Pradesh | Published: April 16, 2017 9:36 PM Commenting over the issue of triple talaq, Khan told ANI that it is an issue that the masses are not very well informed about.(Reuters) \nWith the Supreme Court set to begin the hearings of the petitions against triple talaq next month, Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan on Sunday stated that even if a law contradicting Shariat is made, Muslim men will only follow the Shariat laws. \nCommenting on the issue of triple talaq, Khan told ANI that it is an issue that the masses are not very well informed about. \n\u201cThis is a debate that the country does not know about. If a law is made that is against the Shariat, even then the Muslim men will follow the Shariat laws and not something else,\u201d said Khan. \nHe added, \u201cThe truth is that those who go against the Shariat are socially boycotted.\u201d \nHis statement came hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted that Triple Talaq was a menace crippling the lives of Muslim women in India and called on the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) to attack the issue on a grass-root level. \nAlso Watch: \nMeanwhile, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMLPB) today stated that those who give triple talaq without the reasons prescribed by the Sharia law will face social boycott. \nThe Board further noted that there has been misunderstanding on this issue, and that it will issue a code of conduct on it. \nThe AIMPLB, which has opposed the PILs filed against the triple talaq in the Supreme Court, had earlier on Wednesday said the board will do away with the practice of verbal divorce in one-and-a half years, adding there is no need for government interference. A five-judge constitution bench of the apex court will start hearing from May 11 the petitions against triple talaq. \nThe court will hear pleas filed by several Muslim women challenging the practice under which men can divorce their wives instantly by uttering the word talaq thrice.

By: IANS   9:11 PM A day after Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel\u2019s purported disinterest in expanding business to \u201cpoor countries\u201d like India created controversy in social media, parent company Snap Inc denied the allegation, saying no such remark was made, reports said on Sunday. (Source: IE) \nA day after Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel\u2019s purported disinterest in expanding business to \u201cpoor countries\u201d like India created controversy in social media, parent company Snap Inc denied the allegation, saying no such remark was made, reports said on Sunday. US-based news website Variety on Saturday quoted Snapchat\u2019s ex-employee Anthony Pompliano as saying that Spiegel in September 2015 told him that \u201cthe app is only for rich people. I don\u2019t want to expand into poor countries like India and Spain\u201d. But the company denied the remarks reports of which had resulted in the rating of the popular app dropping to a \u201csingle star\u201d from an apparent \u201cfive star\u201d on the App Store. \n\u201cThe simple fact is that he (Pompliano) knows exactly nothing about Snap\u2019s current metrics. He and his lawyers are \u2014 not to put too fine a point on matters \u2014 just making things up,\u201d Variety reported Snap\u2019s attorneys as saying. Denying the claims of Snapchat being termed as a \u2018rich people\u2019s app\u2019, the attorneys termed Pompliano a \u201cdisgruntled employee fired for poor performance\u201d. \nThe portal YourStory published an official statement from Snap that said: \u201cThis is ridiculous. Obviously Snapchat is for everyone! It\u2019s available worldwide to download for free.\u201d Meanwhile, the rating of the popular app dropped to a \u201csingle star\u201d from \u201cfive star\u201d on the App Store. According to the app info on App Store, the \u201cCustomer Ratings\u201d of the current version of the app was \u201csingle star\u201d (based on 6,099 ratings) and all versions\u2019 rating was \u201cone and half star\u201d (based on 9,527 ratings) as on Sunday morning. \nThe rating for the app on Android Play Store was \u201cfour star\u201d (based on 11,932,996 ratings). Indians did not take the comment lightly and took to social media to lash out at the statement from the CEO. As the ratings of the app dropped, the criticism of the CEO and the app increased. \u201cFirst of all, I didn\u2019t even want to give any freakin\u2019 star to this app. Evan (CEO of Snapchat) shows how stupid he is by saying this. I bet 3/4th of his company is run by Indian employees. If he didn\u2019t want to expand it to poor countries, then why is this app free? Why didn\u2019t he put any charges on it?\u201d a user wrote on App Store, condemning the CEO. \nSome users wrote, \u201cPoor India & Spain need better than Snapchat\u201d, \u201cGood bye, My Snapchat Account and Snap Inc. You\u2019ll be product of gone by era and derision\u201d, and \u201cPoor Evan Spiegel\u201d. The app was also trolled on Twitter. #boycottsnapchat became the most trending hashtag on Twitter overnight. \nYou might also want to see this: \n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen any Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Christians etc Tweets yet. Thanks @Snapchat for Uniting us,\u201d a user tweeted. \u201cI was addicted to @Snapchat but I love my country more than this app. Let\u2019s see how you earn without Indians. @evanspiegel #boycottsnapchat,\u201d another user wrote on twitter. \nSome users even flagged the app for hateful content and left a message, \u201cDear @snapchatsupport, flagged you for hateful content. #boycottsnapchat\u201d. According to a report in Forbes on Thursday, Facebook\u2019s photo-sharing app Instagram surpassed Snapchat in daily active users of \u201cStories\u201d feature, though the format was first launched by Snapchat in 2013. Instagram\u2019s \u201cStories\u201d feature was now used by more than 200 million people every day \u2014 an increase of 50 million since January. \nOn the other hand, Snapchat which launched the \u201cStories\u201d format in October 2013, had 161 million daily active users in February. \u201cStories\u201d feature is an ephemeral chain of photo and video clips with filters and special effects. More recently, Facebook and WhatsApp also introduced the feature, imitating Snapchat. Snapchat has more than four million users in India.

comments row: Netizens uninstall Snapdeal app instead of Snapchat In a case of mistaken identity, many people downgraded and uninstalled the mobile application of e-commerce platform 'Snapdeal' instead of social networking app 'Snapchat'. By: PTI | New Delhi | Published: April 16, 2017 9:00 PM Snapchat\u2019s CEO Evan Spiegel. (Reuters) \nIn a case of mistaken identity, many people downgraded and uninstalled the mobile application of e-commerce platform \u2018 Snapdeal \u2019 instead of social networking app \u2018Snapchat\u2019 to mark their protest against certain unverified comments of Snapchat CEO about the Indian market. \nThe social media was today abuzz with criticism against Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel after a report quoted one of the company\u2019s former employees as saying that the top executive told him that the \u201capp is only for rich people\u201d and that he (CEO) was not interested in expanding the business to \u201cpoor countries\u201d like India and Spain. \nSnapchat, on its part, has rubbished the allegations. \nHowever, soon after the controversy erupted, #BoycottSnapchat became one of the top trending topics on Twitter and people began to uninstall the app and give it poor ratings and reviews on various app stores. \nAlso Watch: \n\u201cDear CEO of Snapchat\u2026why don\u2019t you come to India and check out Indians\u2019 phones,\u201d wrote a user in review of Snapchat\u2019s app. Many also went on to highlight that CEOs of top tech firms like Microsoft and Google are Indians. Interestingly, a section of Internet users mistook Snapchat to be Snapdeal and uninstalled the e-commerce app of the latter. This came to light after netizens started posting pictures of the blunder on Twitter. \nMany users also went on to explain how the two apps were different. \n\u201cTime to balance the ratings\u2026guys its Snapchat\u2019s CEO who said bad things. You are making Snapdeal pay that\u2026please change your ratings,\u201d wrote one of them. \nSnapdeal, which has been in news for a potential sell out to larger rival Flipkart , has faced a similar downgrade in 2015 when its then-brand ambassador Aamir Khan made a comment on growing \u2018intolerance in the country.

However, King headed to Seattle instead and revealed some surprising news on Instagram that night. \n\"Skipped out on my wedding,\" she wrote, alongside a video of her rocking out onstage with Eagles of Death Metal at the Paramount Theatre. \"I married Rock&Roll instead...so I hopped on tour with EAGLES OF F--KING DEATH METAL.\" Photos \nCeleb Wedding Dresses John Shearer/WireImage \nFerguson has not commented. He proposed to King in February 2016 on a boat under the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. \nFerguson, who is Scottish, had met King at the lobby of a hotel in London. He soon quit his job and moved to the United States to be with her. They even got tattoos of each other's names. A post shared by Elle King (@elleking) on Feb 6, 2016 at 11:34am PST \nKing chose her wedding gown, a $4,900 blush, long sleeve, off-the-shoulder, lace, beaded Stephen Yearick A-line dress, at Kleinfeld Bridal in New York City on an episode of TLC's Say Yes to the Dress that aired in March. \nKing had dropped hints in recent weeks that she and Ferguson had split. \nOn March 28, she posted on Instagram a selfie taken in the Hollywood Hills with the caption, \"Gotta say...no matter how heartbreaking one day may be, it's hard to not smile in this California sunshine,\" as well as a photo of her with her girlfriends. Mar 28, 2017 at 4:44pm PDT \n\"All my single ladies,\" she wrote. Mar 28, 2017 at 7:04pm PDT \nLast week, King posted a video of herself snuggling her dog.

But I haven't seen my sugar in a month,\" she wrote. \"Lately I don't cry very much. I feel like it will just be an explosion if I did. But seeing my little baby girl again, and having her by my side, well I lost it. She's my best friend and the only true loyalty I've ever known.\" \n\"Today someone tried to make me feel a certain way about myself,\" she continued. \"But we have to remember, no one can make you feel anything unless you let them. Don't give people power over you. As a human, other people may try to be threatening in more ways than just verbal or physical acts. Always be strong. Always have dogs. Never forget your rights and your worth. If no one has told you today, I love you and I think you're beautiful and are worthy of love and kindness.\" Apr 5, 2017 at 2:29pm PDT \nKing recently bought a house in Los Angeles. She recently made mention of a \"new chapter.\" \n\"All my s--t arrived in boxes while I slept. I think I'll just ignore the mountain for a while,\" King wrote earlier this month. \nA post shared by Elle King (@elleking) on Apr 14, 2017 at 10:59am PDT \n\"If you look at moving boxes as a mountain, it can be overwhelming and terrifying,\" she said Friday. \"But it's been a surprise each time. It's wonderful to rediscover all of your favorite things. I think our memories make up our souls. What we've done, who we've seen, what we've feared, who we've loved. Isn't that what makes us who we are? We can't control the world. All I can control is what I allow within my own world.\" \n\"I'm going to choose happiness and curiosity and try practicing more patience with this new chapter,\" she added. \"It's scary.

"webdesk@voanews.com (Associated Press)", "ord_in_thread": 0, "text": "DUBAI, UAE \u2014  A young Saudi woman's plea for help after she was stopped in an airport in the Philippines en route to Australia where she planned to seek asylum has triggered a firestorm on social media and drawn attention to the plight of female runaways.\nFor runaway Saudi women, fleeing can be a matter of life and death, and they are almost always doing so to escape male relatives.\nUnder Saudi Arabia's conservative interpretation of Islamic law, a male guardianship system bars women from traveling abroad, obtaining a passport, marrying or even leaving prison without the consent of a male relative.\nThe mystery around what triggered Dina Ali Lasloom's cry for help has only added to concerns for her safety. In an online video, the 24-year-old says her passport was taken from her at an airport in the Philippines on her way to Australia last week.\n\"If my family come, they will kill me. If I go back to Saudi Arabia, I will be dead. Please help me,\" she pleads.\nWearing a beige coat, the woman does not show her face in the video. Most women in Saudi Arabia cover their face with a veil known as a niqab. Many do so believing it is a religious obligation, in addition to covering their hair and body. Some also cover their faces due to social pressure.\n\"I am kept here as a criminal. I can't do anything,\" Lasloom says in the video. The Associated Press could not independently verify the video's authenticity.\nWomen's rights advocates in Saudi Arabia say Lasloom was ultimately forced to board a plane to the kingdom with two of her uncles, who flew from Riyadh to stop her. They said authorities then took her to a women's shelter because of the attention around her case.\nShe cannot leave, however, without a male guardian's permission. Activists say only officials and relatives can contact her there.\nAlthough there are no public statistics on how many Saudi women attempt to flee abroad, the issue has gained attention through a number of publicized cases. This despite gains made in recent years for Saudi women, including the right to run in, and vote in, local elections in 2015, and a government effort to increase women's participation in the workforce.\nWomen who have managed to flee abroad say they were barred from marrying or forced into marriages. Others have told rights groups that male relatives were abusive and confiscated their salaries.\n\"Many of them, they just want to be free,\" said Moudi Aljohani, who fled last year and is seeking asylum in the U.S.\nAljohani, 26, says her family felt she'd become \"too Americanized\" after a year of study in Miami. What was supposed to be a weeklong visit home turned into months of confinement, she says.\n\"The eight months of being locked in Saudi Arabia has created an angry, rebellious person inside of me that I don't want to be silent anymore,\" she said. \"What happened to me in Saudi Arabia created a person who just wants to speak out.\"\nFor the past 15 years, four of the late King Abdullah's daughters, Princesses Jawaher, Sahar, Hala and Maha - all in their 40s - have allegedly been held in a royal compound in Saudi Arabia. Their mother, who lives in London, has spoken out in the British press to try and bring attention to their plight. Two of the princesses managed to release videos in recent years pleading for help.\nSaudi courts have heard numerous cases of women asking for a transfer of their guardianship to more sympathetic male relatives - in some cases to their own sons.\nA Saudi women's rights activist reached by phone in Riyadh said Lasloom was apparently trying to flee relatives in Kuwait who threatened to send her to live in Saudi Arabia.\n\"There have been a lot of Saudi girls who sought asylum abroad, but now it's a trend. A lot of younger girls in their 20s are seeking asylum,\" she said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.\n\"When they say honor killings do not exist, it's not true. It's just invisible,\" she said, referring to the killing of daughters in the name of family honor.\nSara Leah Whitson, the Middle East director at Human Rights Watch, says Saudi women fleeing their family can face so-called \"honor\" violence if returned against their will. She called on Saudi authorities to protect Lasloom from her family.\nAccording to the Philippines' Inquirer news website, Lasloom was barred from her Australian-bound flight by Saudi Embassy officials in Manila who asked airport officials to stop her.\nThe Saudi Embassy in the Philippines wrote on Twitter that what occurred was \"a family matter in which a girl was returned with her family to the homeland.\"\nWhen asked by The Associated Press whether Saudi diplomats in the Philippines had requested that authorities in Manila stop Lasloom from boarding a flight to Australia, Foreign Ministry official Osama Nugali said: \"Saudi embassies abroad respect the institutions and laws of host countries and do not interfere in their affairs.\"\nManila Airport General Manager Eddie Monreal told the AP he had no knowledge about the case. An immigration official reached by the AP said the airport's immigration officers neither detained nor held any passenger under that name.\nIn Saudi Arabia, activists tracking her plea for help attempted to meet Lasloom at Riyadh airport overnight Wednesday. They say instead, another activist, Alaa al-Anazi was detained by security officials at the airport and transferred to a girl's detention center in the capital.\nThe Interior Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\nA Human Rights Watch report released last year on guardianship laws in Saudi Arabia found that even with greater opportunities for women in the kingdom, a woman's life rests largely on \"the good will\" of her male guardian.\nPowerful clerics in the kingdom support male guardianship based on a verse in the Quran that says men are the protectors and maintainers of women. Other Islamic scholars argue this misinterprets fundamental Quranic concepts like equality and respect between the sexes. Most Muslim-majority countries do not have similarly restrictive guardianship laws.", "uuid": "bb08fda9ae52d3481b0b0066ed8a471e01d323f4", "entities": {"organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "human rights watch"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "saudi embassy"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "associated press"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "foreign ministry"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "interior ministry"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ap"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "alaa al-anazi"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "sara leah whitson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "osama nugali"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "eddie monreal"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "lasloom"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "moudi aljohani"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "princesses jawaher"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dina ali lasloom"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "hala"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "abdullah"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "uae"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dubai"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "saudi arabia"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "middle east"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "sahar"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "philippines"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "london"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "manila"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "australia"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kuwait"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "riyadh"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "u.s.  aljohani"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "miami"}]}, "highlightTitle": ""}, {"published": "2017-04-16T17:10:11.000+03:00", "highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YuZjPcTcrfKQXWWp.8B_z87wDFwH_p5uP20SUI6pLrvCUGJwU1LGiMoxXLXC3fLUuRXENTRTHmLn6.ttpMQeMcIYwSnFSF8EQgjfu6h1vNCtl23jzGttv1zsq_sDYO4Lt4ZuXvd3wDH5J9NlFRDdB34vyKr.0ZkU-", "thread": {"published": "2017-04-16T17:10:11.000+03:00", "spam_score": 0.665, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YuZjPcTcrfKQXWWp.8B_z87wDFwH_p5uP20SUI6pLrvCUGJwU1LGiMoxXLXC3fLUuRXENTRTHmLn6.ttpMQeMcIYwSnFSF8EQgjfu6h1vNCtl23jzGttv1zsq_sDYO4Lt4ZuXvd3wDH5J9NlFRDdB34vyKr.0ZkU-", "site_full": "www.financialexpress.com", "domain_rank": 4726, "main_image": "http://images.financialexpress.com/2017/03/nexon-small.jpg", "replies_count": 0, "title": "Tata Nexon spied without camouflage, to be launched later this year - The Financial Express", "participants_count": 0, "section_title": "", "performance_score": 9, "site": "financialexpress.com", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 922, "likes": 922}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}}, "uuid": "365840af7fba6da47203bed658f614b3c1af003b", "site_section": "", "country": "US", "site_categories": [], "title_full": "Tata Nexon spied without camouflage, to be launched later this year - The Financial Express", "site_type": "news"}, "crawled": "2017-04-16T17:10:11.000+03:00", "rating": null, "title": "Tata Nexon spied without camouflage, to be launched later this year - The Financial Express", "language": "english", "author": "Fe Online", "ord_in_thread": 0, "text": "Tata Nexon spied without camouflage, to be launched later this year Tata Nexon spied without camouflage, to be launched later this year The SUV will get a host of other features such as touch screen infotainment system, navigation, Bluetooth connectivity, steering mounted controls, automatic climate control and keyless entry.

By: PTI | New Delhi | Published: April 16, 2017 6:12 PM Last year, at the behest of Maneka, the Ministry of External Affairs had revised its passport application rules and announced that the name of only one parent, and not both, was enough, enabling single parents to apply for passports for their children. (Reuters) \nFollowing concerns raised by single mothers, Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi has written to HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar, urging him to change the rule that requires father\u2019s name to be mandatorily mentioned on a student\u2019s degree certificate. Last year, at the behest of Maneka, the Ministry of External Affairs had revised its passport application rules and announced that the name of only one parent, and not both, was enough, enabling single parents to apply for passports for their children. \n\u201cI have been approached by several women who are separated from their husbands and who face problems getting degree certificates issued for their children without their father\u2019s name,\u201d reads the letter written by Maneka to Javadekar. She explains in her letter that \u201cbreakdown of marriages and separation between husband and wife is now a reality\u201d and rules must reflect this. \nAlso Watch: \n\u201cKeeping in view the sensitivity of the single/separated mother, we need to make a provision for this purpose by changing rules/guidelines,\u201d the letter adds. Priyanka Gupta, a single parent, had initiated a petition last year on Change.org, asking for passport rules to be altered, so that she was not required to mention her husband\u2019s name on her daughter\u2019s passport. The petition was addressed to Maneka and External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj. \nSubsequently, Maneka had written to Swaraj and a three- member committee comprising officials of the two ministries was constituted. Months later, the MEA announced the revised set of passport rules and declared that the name of only one parent was enough and that married applicants will not have to produce a marriage certificate and share their spouse\u2019s name if they were separated or divorced.

He\u2019s been there for the past 50 years\u2014yet, nobody seems to notice that one of the professors has outlasted even the most determined of tenured faculty. Who fans may recognize this from \u201cShada,\u201d a never-completed story that Adams wrote for the 1979-1980 season: that planned arc featured another Time Lord who had spent decades teaching at Cambridge University (in the fictional St. Cedd\u2019s College), with nobody noticing his agelessness. \nJust like Professor Chronotis, the renegade Time Lord in Adams\u2019 story, the current Doctor is hiding some incredibly valuable Time Lord artifact on campus\u2014though at least he\u2019s gotten himself a fancy vault for it. Plenty of other Adams fill the episode as well. \u201cBristol\u201d is the nickname the Doctor gives to Chris Parsons, one of his friends in \u201cShada,\u201d and at one point during a lecture the Doctor says \u201ctime is an illusion,\u201d which is the beginning of a Hitchhiker\u2019s quote (one which ends \u201c\u2026lunchtime doubly so.\u201d). \nEven the Dalek battle owes something to Adamas. When the Doctor takes off across the universe with his new companions Bill and Nardole, he visits a battle between the Daleks and a strangely familiar army of disco robots. These are the Movellans, who appeared in the 1979 story \u201cDestiny of the Daleks\u201d\u2014a script that may have been written by Terry Nation, but was very much a product of Adams\u2019 wholesale rewrite . \nReferences aside, last night\u2019s episode is suffused with a distinctly Adams-esque sense of fun . To wit: the introduction of Bill (Pearl Mackie), as the Doctor\u2019s new companion. A young lesbian who works in the cafeteria serving \u201cchips\u201d (fries to Americans), Bill crashes the Doctor\u2019s lectures, and he notices her curious mind. So he plucks her out of the crowd and becomes her private tutor, leading to some lovely, giddy moments\u2014like the two of them sitting and wearing paper crowns, or Bill\u2019s attempts to teach the Doctor about science fiction. \nMeanwhile, the plot is somewhat forgettable: it revolves around Bill\u2019s crush on a girl named Heather (Stephanie Hyam), who discovers a puddle that gives a strange reflection. (It\u2019s one of writer Steven Moffat\u2019s trademark \u201coptical effect\u201d monsters.) After Heather takes a dip in the puddle, she comes back as a watery zombie\u2014not unlike the watery zombies in the 2009 Who special \u201cWaters of Mars\u201d\u2014who then chases Bill and the Doctor all over the universe. \nThe real heart of the episode, though, lies in the spiky student-teacher relationship between the Doctor and Bill. With the Doctor an actual teacher (instead of simply lecturing on an amateur basis), his sparring with Bill is more vital and urgent than it has been with other recent Companions. And after years of the scarily competent Clara, it\u2019s refreshing to see the Doctor paired up with a human who\u2019s just figuring out the ropes\u2014and whose quirky observations help to deflate the Doctor\u2019s pomposity. \nMackie\u2019s mixture of wide-eyed wonder and perfect British sarcasm gives Peter Capaldi a comedic partner to play off, and he takes full advantage. Given that dynamic, Bill feels like the Twelfth Doctor\u2019s answer to Donna, the snarky maniac who had great comic chemistry, but no sexual or romantic chemistry, with the Tenth Doctor (David Tennant). That said, the humor doesn\u2019t always work: the episode could have done without the fat joke, or Bill taking twice as long as every other companion to grasp that the TARDIS is bigger inside than outside. \nAnd yet, this Doctor Who episode fully earns its Douglas Adams references; its blend of silliness and spiky wit reminds fans that the show is often at its best when it\u2019s not taking itself seriously\u2014and knows where its towel is.", "uuid": "348236bf438f97550341305def330e2137d352f0", "entities": {"organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "cambridge university"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "st. cedd\u2019s college"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "time lord"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "peter capaldi"}, {"sentiment": "neutral", "name": "douglas adams"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "nardole"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "heather"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "donna"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "david tennant"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "clara"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "adams"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "stephanie hyam"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "shada"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "chronotis"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "terry nation"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "mackie"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "steven moffat"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "bill"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "chris parsons"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "bristol"}]}, "highlightTitle": ""}, {"published": "2017-04-16T15:21:54.000+03:00", "highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKxMbCZQZwZJjeRau7BtV0KLIS3upm37PcwiRu._BcuEUJlNUFi_TbsnYQQyYW.O5eFPoNqQjHteT_E8O308erYE8jGvU2gyh5YwZuuv7Nh4gyMe8D4kW6LpSr8GVbEr.VMJgA8bNh6OszuXhyz00T9snX0Zg0IO3Z2xO6EpDIM6aA--", "thread": {"published": "2017-04-16T15:21:54.000+03:00", "spam_score": 0.0, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKxMbCZQZwZJjeRau7BtV0KLIS3upm37PcwiRu._BcuEUJlNUFi_TbsnYQQyYW.O5eFPoNqQjHteT_E8O308erYE8jGvU2gyh5YwZuuv7Nh4gyMe8D4kW6LpSr8GVbEr.VMJgA8bNh6OszuXhyz00T9snX0Zg0IO3Z2xO6EpDIM6aA--", "site_full": "profit.ndtv.com", "domain_rank": 306, "main_image": "https://i.ndtvimg.com/i/2017-04/life-line-express-650_650x400_61492344547.jpg", "replies_count": 0, "title": "Glass Roof, Rotatable Seats: Here's a Peek Into Railways New Coaches", "participants_count": 0, "section_title": "NDTV News  -  Special", "performance_score": 6, "site": "ndtv.com", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 653, "likes": 653}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}}, "uuid": "b747109e693fb6ec9998eacef2ec9ce8efd1895a", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/NDTV-LatestNews", "country": "US", "site_categories": [], "title_full": "Glass Roof, Rotatable Seats: Here's a Peek Into Railways New Coaches", "site_type": "news"}, "crawled": "2017-04-16T15:21:54.000+03:00", "rating": null, "title": "Glass Roof, Rotatable Seats: Here's a Peek Into Railways New Coaches", "language": "english", "author": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "text": "Glass Roof To Rotatable Seats: Here's A Peek Into Indian Railways' New Coaches The new coach having features like glass roof, LED lights, rotable seats, GPS-based information system among others.

Chandrasekhar Rao moved the bill to raise from the existing four per cent to 12 per cent the quota for the socially and economically backward among the Muslims under the Backward Classes (E) category. \n\nThe reservations for the Scheduled Tribes in educational institutions and government jobs has been increased from 6 per cent to 10 per cent. \n\nAfter the state legislative council passes it by late Sunday evening, the bill will be sent for the President's assent with a request to include it in the 9th Schedule of the Constitution as was done in the case of Tamil Nadu . \n\nReplying to debate on the bill, Chief Minister Chandrasekhar Rao said if the Centre refuses to accept Telengana's request, the state would approach the Supreme Court. \n\nRao said, \"Tamil Nadu is implementing 69 per cent reservations for over two decades. Five to six states are providing more than 50 per cent reservation. How can you deny this to Telangana?\" \n\nThe Supreme Court has put a cap of 50 per cent on all reservations both a the Centre and in the states. \n\nThe Chief Minister clarified that the reservations were being provided purely on the basis of socio-economic backwardness and not on the basis of religion or caste as some parties were project before the people. \n\nTerming it as a historic day, Rao said the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) had during the election campaigns promised that quota for the Backward Classes (E) and the Scheduled Tribes will be increased in proportion to their population in the state. \n\nHe assured the Backward Classes that there will be no injustice to them because of increase in quota for the BC (E) and announced that the quota for the BCs too9 will be increased. The state government has directed the Backward Classes Commission to submit a report within six months. \n\nRao also said that the reservation for the SCs, who constitute 16.3 per cent of the state's population, will be increased by one per cent. He said the government would soon constitute an SC Commission. \n\nThe SCs are currently enjoying 15 per cent reservations while the BCs have a total quota of 25 per cent. \n\nThe legislation will increase the total reservations in the state to 62 per cent. \n\nThe Chief Minister argued that there is no constitutional bar on providing more than 50 per cent reservation. \n\nRao said with 90 per cent of Telangana's population comprising the Backward Classes, SCs, STs and minorities, the state definitely needed more than 50 per cent reservation, and pointed out that states like Tamil Nadu and Jharkhand were already providing more than 50 per cent quota. \n\nThe Telangana Chief Minister made it clear that he will not beg the Centre but will fight to get the new quotas included in the 9th Schedule. \n\nKCR, as the Chief Minister is popularly known, said Telangana would raise this issue at the meeting of the Niti Aayog and in Parliament. He hoped that a debate on the issue will begin and consensus will build at the national level. \n\nHe defended the state's hike in quota for Muslims and hit back at the BJP for opposing it. \n\n\"Why can't we give them reservation? Why should they be denied reservation just because they are Muslims? Are they not part of this country,\" asked Chandrasekhar Rao in the absence of all five members of the BJP, who were earlier suspended for the day by the Speaker for disrupting the proceedings. \n\nHe pointed out that India has the largest Muslim community in the world and even some of the so-called Islamic countries do not have such a large Muslim population. \n\nKCR said the promise to increase the Muslim quota was part of the TRS manifesto and people approved this agenda by giving their mandate to the party. \n\nThe All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) suggested to the government to take steps to protect the existing four per cent reservation while increasing the quota by eight per cent. Its member Ahmed Pasha Khadri said a new category BC (F) be created for hiked quota. \n\nThe Chief Minister, however, said there was no need for any apprehensions as there will be no threat to the existing four percent reservations.", "uuid": "0e1f94650a5240908cfba65f4597c7b500f3e6d0", "entities": {"organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "bjp"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "bharatiya janata party"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "backward classes commission"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "supreme court"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "sc commission"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kcr"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "parliament"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "telangana"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "rao"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "telengana"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "majlis-e-ittehadul muslimeen"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "telangana rashtra samithi"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "k. chandrasekhar rao"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "chandrasekhar rao"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ahmed pasha khadri"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "hyderabad"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "tamil nadu"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "india"}]}, "highlightTitle": ""}, {"published": "2017-04-16T15:11:07.000+03:00", "highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTUdeK56G.tyiB9DIr8dEt3M7qwCWnNJ0VVoI1AFtqLDcVQYoMGc3mORJEEXyulrjVCJnMizVnNR3jL4xtbK.jRu7Tk8lwRd0o-", "thread": {"published": "2017-04-16T15:11:07.000+03:00", "spam_score": 0.0, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTUdeK56G.tyiB9DIr8dEt3M7qwCWnNJ0VVoI1AFtqLDcVQYoMGc3mORJEEXyulrjVCJnMizVnNR3jL4xtbK.jRu7Tk8lwRd0o-", "site_full": "sputniknews.com", "domain_rank": 1616, "main_image": "https://cdn4.img.sputniknews.com/images/105266/41/1052664195.jpg", "replies_count": 0, "title": "N Korea on 'Missile Launch': 'It's Our Right,' But it's Not Announced Officially", "participants_count": 0, "section_title": "Sputnik International - Breaking News & Analysis - Radio, Photos, Videos, Infographics", "performance_score": 6, "site": "sputniknews.com", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 4}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"comments": 1, "shares": 687, "likes": 687}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}}, "uuid": "776b125ed6c47452d26fa668cf4211ce89a45e61", "site_section": "http://www.sputniknews.com/export/rss2/archive/index.xml", "country": "RU", "site_categories": [], "title_full": "N Korea on 'Missile Launch': 'It's Our Right,' But it's Not Announced Officially", "site_type": "news"}, "crawled": "2017-04-16T15:11:07.000+03:00", "rating": null, "title": "N Korea on 'Missile Launch': 'It's Our Right,' But it's Not Announced Officially", "language": "english", "author": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "text": "N Korea on 'Missile Launch': 'It's Our Right,' But it's Not Announced Officially \u00a9 REUTERS/ Damir Sagolj 2 3476 27 2 The North Korean Foreign Ministry commented on the suspected failed missile launch conducted earlier in the day. \u00a9 AP Photo/ Wong Maye-E Trump's Long Game: Why Nuclear Apocalypse Didn't Erupt on Korean Peninsula Earlier on Sunday, Pyongyang supposedly launched an unidentified projectile , but the test appeared to have failed.

Cade Metz Business Date of Publication: 04.16.17. Time of Publication: 7:00 am. 7:00 am A Chip Revolution Will Bring Better VR Sooner Than You Think Getty Images \nDavid Kosslyn and Ian Thompson are the founders of a virtual reality company called Angle Technologies . Two years into this stealth project, backed by $8 million in funding, they won\u2019t say much about the virtual world they\u2019re building\u2014at least not publicly. But they will say that they\u2019re building it in a way that alters the relationship between computer hardware and software. When a PC or a game console runs this virtual world, the GPU chips play an unexpectedly large role, taking so much of the burden off the main processor. \nGPU is short for graphics processing unit. These chips were originally designed as a better way of rendering graphics for games and other software. And they still play this all-important role for the virtual world under development at Angle. But that\u2019s not all. Kosslyn and Thompson are shifting countless other tasks onto these chips, just because GPUs are so good at running so many calculations in parallel. A single machine can hold hundreds of GPU chips, and each chip can operate largely on its own. Juggling hundreds of digital tasks at the same time, Kosslyn and Thompson say, these chips can get you far closer to the illusion that you\u2019re standing in an alternate universe. How a Chip Is Made \nWhen they first started building their virtual world, Kosslyn and Thompson pushed most of those tasks through the CPU, a computer\u2019s main processor. But that just didn\u2019t work. As Kosslyn explains, they used the CPU to create new objects as you moved through this world\u2014trees, bushes, rocks, and whatever else they needed to mimic reality. Loading each object into the chip took about one-fifth of a millisecond\u2014far too long, considering just how many objects they needed to load. \n\u201cIf you scale that up to 10 million objects, you\u2019re suddenly crushed by the order of magnitude. Just loading the world is incredibly slow,\u201d Kosslyn says. \u201cWe thought: \u2018Man, if only we had a parallel way of doing all these pretty much independent operations really quickly.\u2019 And, well, that\u2019s exactly what the GPU is really good at.\u201d \nTheir approach is part of a much wider shift across the world of hardware and software. For decades, the processing power available from individual computer chips increased every 18 months or so, according to the oft-quoted Moore\u2019s Law . But in recent years, this trend has begun to slow, even as modern software applications demanded far more processing power than ever before. \u201cSome people call it the end of Moore\u2019s Law,\u201d says Google chip engineer Norm Jouppi. \u201cI like to call it the retirement of Moore\u2019s Law, because it\u2019s not totally dead yet but it\u2019s definitely not working as hard.\u201d The result: Companies and coders are now moving workloads off the main CPU and onto a wide range of alternative processors. If they can\u2019t get enough processing power from a single chip, they need many. \nThese changes have already pushed through the massive data centers that underpin the likes of Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Amazon. Because their sweeping online services can no longer handle all tasks on CPUs alone, these companies are moving major processing loads onto GPUs , programmable chips called FPGAs , and even custom-built chips , such as the AI processor that Jouppi helped design at Google. Neural networks and other forms of AI are often the driving forces behind this shift.

The nation\u2019s leader, Kim Jung Un, had recently said his military was close to conducting such a test. Donald Trump, the US president, warned that he was prepared to act if North Korea became more aggressive, though his public statements have been confusing and contradictory . \nThe attempted missile launch heightens what was already one of the tensest times on the Korean peninsula since North Korea began working to build nuclear weapons and intercontinental missiles.

The newspaper claims to have seen documents mentioning this amount listed under \u201cseparation/severance cost\u201d and \u201cEskom pension fund\u201d payment. \nMolefe earned about R8m a year as Eskom boss and was also allocated shares. \nREAD: Madonsela: Molefe can clear his name \nEskom board spokesperson Khulani Qoma told Fin24 that whatever Molefe received was due to him. Qoma emphasised that whatever was due to Molefe, was paid at the end of last year. He has not received anything this year. \n\"In terms of governance we have to follow a stipulated protocol. That is why we cannot make any information known ahead of the release of the annual reports,\" Qoma told Fin24 on Sunday. \n\"We maintain that there is nothing untoward in what Molefe has received. Whatever he has received was due to him and appropriate in terms of the Labour Relations Act.\" \nQoma said whatever any of the Eskom directors received, including Molefe, will be available in the audited results due out in June. \nA spokesperson for Eskom also told Fin24 on Sunday that all executive remuneration is reported in its integrated report, and as such Molefe\u2019s remuneration will be reported in the 2016/17 integrated report, which will be released later on in the year. \nColin Cruywagen, spokesperson for Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown, told Fin24 on Sunday that he wants to repeat what the minister has already said, namely that she is not aware of any severance package paid out to Molefe. \n\"It is an Eskom operational matter managed by the Eskom board. As the minister said, it will only be brought to her attention if it is something unusual,\" said Cruywagen. \n\"So, the fact that it was not brought to her attention indicates that there was nothing unusual.\" Follow Fin24 on Twitter , Facebook , Google+ and Pinterest . 24.com encourages commentary submitted via MyNews24 .
