He was 72. According to TMZ, Gooding was found dead in his car on Thursday (April 20) in Woodland Hills, California. Gooding joined The Main Ingredient in 1971 when the former lead singer Donald McPherson died unexpectedly of leukemia. He had served as a backing vocalist on some of their recordings previously. While he was with the RCA-signed band, the act scored five top 10 hits on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, including their highest-charting effort: 1972's \"Everybody Plays the Fool,\" which peaked at No. 2 for three weeks. The track also was their biggest hit on the all-genre Billboard Hot 100, climbing to No. 3. The Gooding-led act also notched top 10s on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart with \"Just Don't Want to Be Lonely,\" \"Happiness Is Just Around the Bend\" and \"Rolling Down a Mountainside.\" In 1977, Gooding left the band to pursue a solo career on Motown in 1977, releasing two albums. In 1979, he reunited with his Main Ingredient bandmates they continued to work together through the 1980s. Gooding resumed his solo career in 1993 and did not participate in a 1999 reunion of his old band. Gooding also had a minor acting career. Gooding himself as a solo artist notched two R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart hits of his own: 1978's \"Mind Pleaser\" and 1983's \"Happiness Is Just Around the Bend,\" which reached Nos. 91 and 43 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, respectively. More than two decades later, Gooding returned to Billboard's charts with the top 10-charting Adult Contemporary airplay chart hit \"This Christmas\" (Richard Kincaid featuring Cuba Gooding Sr.). It climbed to No. 9 in December of 2012. The singer had four children with his wife Shirley Gooding: actors Cuba Gooding Jr., Omar Gooding, April Gooding and musician Tommy Gooding.

He\u2019s referring to that intensely emotional evening on Sept. 1 last year, when the Revolution reunited onstage at First Avenue \u2014 the Minneapolis club where Purple Rain \u2019s concert scenes were filmed \u2014 and celebrated the life and legacy of their former boss.\n\u201cTo walk on that stage and play those songs, knowing that he\u2019s not there,\u201d guitarist Wendy Melvoin says contemplatively, her voice trailing off. On that night, Melvoin \u2014 who handled most of the lead vocals in Prince\u2019s tragic absence \u2014 appeared the most emotional onstage, sometimes struggling to make it through songs like \u201cSometimes It Snows in April.\u201d But she says that by the third and final show of the band\u2019s First Avenue residency, \u201cthe five of us felt a lift. There were more smiles onstage for us. There was more playfulness, and you could feel \u2014 dare I say without sounding too New-Agey? I am not really into this or anything \u2014 but you could actually sense that he looked at us and went, \u2018It\u2019s OK.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cLike kind of a s\u00e9ance,\u201d Bobby adds.\nMelvoin nods. \u201cIt was weird. And we walked offstage and cried.\u201d\nNow, more than six months after that historic evening and a year after Prince\u2019s sudden and shocking death at age 57, Melvoin, Bobby, and the three other core members of the Revolution \u2014 bassist Brownmark and keyboardists Doctor Fink and Lisa Coleman \u2014 are sitting with Yahoo Music at the L.A. rehearsal space where they\u2019re prepping for a nationwide reunion tour . And they\u2019re in good spirits, eager to share their memories of Prince.\n\u201cHe was as you could\u2019ve possibly imagined greatness to be,\u201d says Melvoin, who joined the Revolution in 1983 when she was just 19 years old. (Melvoin\u2019s very first public gig with the band took place at First Avenue, and incredibly, three of the recorded performances from that night made it onto the Purple Rain album. \u201cHe was frantically telling us we\u2019re making history: \u2018We\u2019re making history tonight, this is history tonight,\u2019\u201d recalls Bobby.) \u201cWhen you were in a room with him, he was it . He was ephemeral. He was otherworldly. And he was as talented, or more talented, than what you\u2019d expect. It was jaw-dropping to be around it.\u201d\n\u201cHe was the \u2018funky Yoda\u2019 to me,\u201d says Brownmark. \u201cMy first encounter with him was at his house; Bobby took me out there. To me, the doors were 20 feet high \u2026 because I was scared to death. He opened the door, and I was like, \u2018Oh, my God. This dude is a rock star!\u2019 \u2014 because I never been that close to a real, hardcore rock star. I was blown away. From that moment, my life changed. My whole thought process of what stardom was \u2014 it changed at that point. I really started to get the difference between who I was and who this guy was.\u201d\nBobby, who joined Prince\u2019s musical entourage earlier, in 1979, remembers that even before Prince was an actual rock star, he was a rock star. \u201cFor me, when it started, Prince was very unfamous. We were very unfamous together,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cBut he still had all these magical qualities. He used to practice being a rock star \u2014 like, he couldn\u2019t go into restaurants, or he couldn\u2019t go into a gas station, because he was going to be a rock star and he was going to be famous. He was always projecting himself to be this persona. \u2026 It\u2019s just mind-boggling to think that he conjured up all this confidence and skill. We were all mere mortals. I knew that in the first look of the guy, you could tell he wasn\u2019t a human. He was more of a reptile, or something different in his DNA.\u201d\n\u201cOne thing that a lot of people don\u2019t realize about him is he lived and breathed what he did,\u201d says Brownmark, who joined the band in 1982. \u201cMy first assignment, before I even picked up a guitar, was in Prince\u2019s living room: Look at myself in the mirror eight hours a day. He would tell me how to stand. He said, \u2018No, pivot your foot that way. OK, now turn your cheek to do this. Get your shoulder up. Bend your shoulder back.\u2019 That\u2019s how he trained me. Then it got to a point where I would be out at a club somewhere and I\u2019d be standing, I\u2019d have this pose, and people would come up to me and say, \u2018Mark, what\u2019s wrong with you? Why are you standing like that?\u2019 I didn\u2019t even know I was doing it.\nRead More \u201cHe would condition you like that,\u201d continues Brownmark, revealing that the band members even took ballet lessons with Prince, at his insistence, to hone their stage skills for the Purple Rain film . \u201cThe more you rehearse, the more you don\u2019t think about it, the less you think about it. Then the more fun you have, and that was the key to the Revolution. We didn\u2019t think about it. He would throw up these cues, and we knew every marker, we knew every cue, and we would hit it \u2014 just BAM, BAM! We knew right where to hit.\u201d\nMelvoin elaborates on Prince\u2019s vision when it came to assembling the Revolution: \u201cHe hired these individuals; we came to the picture with singular personalities and self-possessed in our own lives. That translated to each one of our personalities with an instrument. Bobby was always the gentleman and put-together, and that reflected in his absolute pocket, meat-and-potatoes, four-on-the-floor drumming, sturdy. Lisa, the ethereal person who walks on air, whispers when she talks \u2014 her music sounds that way. Matt [Fink], he is like a doctor; he can play his keyboard and get from the left side of the 88 keys all the way to the right side faster than any human being. And [Brownmark] is the sexy, gorgeous, all-encompassing, curious flirt, and that\u2019s how his bass sounds.\u201d\nBobby adds that Prince had a \u201cgrand vision\u201d for the aptly named Revolution inspired by coed bands like Fleetwood Mac, racially mixed acts like Sly & the Family Stone, and the ethnic diversity of Minneapolis\u2019s Uptown neighborhood. \u201cWhite, black, Puerto Rican, everybody just a-freakin\u2019,\u201d he quips, quoting a line from Prince\u2019s Dirty Mind track \u201cUptown.\u201d\nMelvoin and Coleman especially appreciated the band\u2019s sense of inclusivity. \u201cI was very aware that [Prince] loved female musicians,\u201d Melvoin says. \u201cMy being a woman onstage gave him license to be just even that much more androgynous and be more in touch with his own female energy, and I got the permission to be in touch with more of my male energy\u2026 I wanted to be more of a counterpart to him, and he wanted me to be more of a counterpart, so we both got what we wanted out of it.\u201d\nStill, Melvoin and Coleman can\u2019t help but roll their eyes when asked about the famous \u201cIs the water warm enough?\u201d intro from the provocative Purple Rain track \u201c Computer Blue .\u201d What did that mean, exactly?\n\u201c\u2019Are you gay?\u2019 That\u2019s what it meant,\u201d groans Melvoin, who was actually in a serious romantic relationship with Coleman for 20 years. \u201cDo you want to get in the bathtub with me, Lisa? Are we lovers? \u2018Are they gay? Are they not?\u2019 He was working that angle.\u201d\n\u201cThat was another fantasy episode going on in his brain that he got the public sucked into. Sexually suggestive lyrics were part of his early core to the end,\u201d Bobby chuckles.\n\u201cYou have to have a certain amount of f***ability, being a woman first and not a musician,\u201d Melvoin continues, discussing the objectification most women face in the music industry, \u201cand I didn\u2019t have access to that part of myself \u2014 and didn\u2019t want to have access to that part. But I was OK with the way Prince saw [female musicianship]. I didn\u2019t have much of a relationship to what it really meant in the big picture, to him and his world, but I was honored to be in this band. For me, it was more like: \u2018Oh, my God, I\u2019m part of the Revolution!\u2019 Sure, we\u2019re the chicks in the band, but he\u2019s a Jew, he\u2019s a Jew, and that\u2019s a black guy!\u201d\nFor a while, the multicultural Revolution played in harmony, hitting their commercial and critical peak with 1984\u2019s landmark Purple Rain film and soundtrack. But Prince was already moving on to his next projects, 1985\u2019s more psychedelic (and less successful) Around the World in a Day, and the Under the Cherry Moon movie and its accompanying soundtrack, titled Parade , in 1986.\n\u201cYou know, before we even hit the first show of the Purple Rain tour, he was already bored with Purple Rain ,\u201d laughs Bobby. \u201cHe really thought that people would be done with Purple Rain \u2014 but as we know now, they\u2019re not done with Purple Rain . He was just moving so fast. It was like next, next, next. But Purple Rain is something that people want to examine for centuries now. I look back at everything, but he didn\u2019t \u2014 he wasn\u2019t very good at looking back.\n\u201cThe thing about Prince is the hairstyle would change the whole thing,\u201d Bobby adds with a laugh, \u201cand he was already moving into the hairstyle for \u2018Raspberry Beret.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cHe hated his hair on Around the World in a Day !\u201d says Melvoin. \u201cHe said to me at the video [for \u2018Raspberry Beret\u2019], \u2018I hate my hair; I look like Lou Ferrigno.\u2019 I was like, \u2018The Hulk? He said, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ve got the Hulk\u2019s hair.\u2019\u201d\nMore seriously, Melvoin says, \u201cObviously, Purple Rain was the pinnacle of his, like, \u2018I\u2019m a pop star and these are masterpiece pop songs.\u2019 Afterward, the roots [no pun intended] started going in all these different areas, and he was trying to cherry-pick all these different elements of himself to explore.\u201d\nAnd that was the beginning of the end for the Revolution. As the band worked on the double album Sign O\u2019 the Times , which was eventually credited as a solo Prince album when it came out in 1987, Bobby recalls that Prince \u201cwas starting to become, finally, after being a superstar all those years, kind of like, \u2018You know, I kind of want to do this myself again.\u2019 I was kind of getting the sense that we had become such a huge part of his everyday life that he may have \u2026 well, we don\u2019t know that he was growing a little tired of it, but we\u2019re a handful. I mean, we weren\u2019t just sidemen. We were the Revolution , and we opened our mouths often.\u201d\n\u201cI knew something shifted our last night at [Japan\u2019s] Yokohama Stadium,\u201d says Melvoin, referring to the Revolution\u2019s final concert on Sept. 9, 1986. \u201cWe were onstage, and he started calling a whole bunch of different people onstage with us while we were playing \u2014 and he hadn\u2019t done that before. And we knew him, and I knew him so well. He wasn\u2019t looking at us. I could feel it. And then we played \u2018Purple Rain,\u2019 and he destroyed the guitar. He destroyed it. And I looked at Bobby, and I went, \u2018It\u2019s over.\u2019 I looked at Lisa. \u2018It\u2019s over!\u2019 And it was over.\u201d\nLater, back in the States, Prince invited Melvoin and Coleman over to his L.A. rental house for dinner \u2014 what Coleman jokingly calls a meal of \u201cpaper-wrapped chicken,\u201d because the women received their pink slips. \u201cI knew it was coming; I just knew it. I was bereft ,\u201d says Melvoin. \u201cI was like, \u2018 What? Now? Why? \u2019 But you know, you can\u2019t swim upstream when someone\u2019s done. When someone\u2019s done, they\u2019re done. And you just have to go, \u2018OK.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cHe just had a vision of a different group in his head,\u201d Bobby shrugs.\nThe full, classic Revolution lineup never ended up playing with Prince again, but Melvoin says that after their breakup, there were \u201cyears of [Prince] sending smoke signals for us to get back there.\u201d (Fink continued to work with Prince through 1990\u2019s Graffiti Bridge ; Brownmark says he was invited to join Prince\u2019s post-Revolution band, the New Power Generation, but declined; and Melvoin and Coleman did perform with Prince at the Brit Awards in 2006 .) A proper Revolution reunion will obviously never happen now, but as the surviving members prepare to hit the road, they believe Prince would approve.\n\u201cHe wants us to play,\u201d Brownmark insists. \u201cHe liked to party, loved to enjoy his music with people. That\u2019s what he wants us to do. Just because he\u2019s gone, he doesn\u2019t want us to go \u2018boo-hoo\u2019 and then go away. He wants us to share while we\u2019re here and enjoy what was.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to feel a loss. You will feel a loss,\u201d Melvoin says of what to expect from this year\u2019s Revolution reunion tour. \u201c We feel it. But we\u2019re being respectful about how we\u2019re doing this, in a way that none of us are [trying to be Prince] at all.\u201d\nStill, even without their leader, the Revolution members are aware that the chemistry and history they share is special. \u201c[Prince] called us Mount Rushmore,\u201d says Bobby. \u201cHe knew that this was something unique. And when you go through this together, the movie, the tours\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re astronauts. We, like, went to the moon,\u201d Melvoin interjects.\n\u201cYeah, we did,\u201d says Bobby. \u201cWe left our footprints on the moon.\u201d\nFollow Lyndsey on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , Google+

I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the President of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and Constitutional power.\u201d\nThe Justice Department head was referring to a ruling by Judge Derrick Watson last month that put a hold on President Trump\u2019s revised executive order banning immigration from certain countries.\n \u201cThe judges don\u2019t get to psychoanalyze the President to see if the order he issues is lawful,\u201d Sessions continued. \u201cIt\u2019s either lawful or it\u2019s not.\u201d Trump\u2019s statements during the campaign about wanting to keep Muslims out of the country have been pointed out by opponents of the executive order, who claim they reveal an unconstitutional religious bias behind the ban.\nHawaii\u2019s U.S. senators \u2014 both Democrats \u2014 rebuked Sessions for the comments.\n\u201cHey Jeff Sessions, this #IslandinthePacific has been the 50th state for going on 58 years,\u201d tweeted Sen. Mazie Hirono . \u201cAnd we won\u2019t succumb to your dog whistle politics. Hawaii was built on the strength of diversity & immigrant experiences- including my own. Jeff Sessions\u2019 comments are ignorant & dangerous\u201d\n\u201cMr. Attorney General,\u201d tweeted Sen. Brian Schatz . \u201cYou voted for that judge. And that island is called Oahu. It\u2019s my home. Have some respect.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not the first time Trump or his team have called into question the authority of the judiciary. When a federal court in Washington ruled against the original travel ban executive order, Trump referred to Judge James Robart as a \u201cso-called judge.\u201d Robart was an appointee of President George W. Bush who was confirmed by the Senate 99-0. Last year Trump said Judge Gonzalo Curiel should recuse himself from a lawsuit involving Trump University because of his \u201cMexican heritage,\u201d calling him a \u201chater\u201d and \u201ctotal disgrace.\u201d Judge Curiel was born in Indiana to parents who were immigrants from Mexico.\nRead more from Yahoo News:\n\u2022 Bill O\u2019Reilly: \u2018Completely unfounded claims\u2019 caused my Fox News departure\n\u2022 Clinton campaign biographer on where she went wrong\n\u2022 Victims of neo-Nazi trolling in Whitefish, Mont., strike back in court\n\u2022 5 takeaways from Jon Ossoff\u2019s showing in Georgia special election\n\u2022 Photos: Retrospective \u2013 Photojournalist Chris Hondros", "crawled": "2017-04-20T23:11:13.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-20T23:11:13.000+03:00", "uuid": "9d73c0206ba9a19212dbefeb81268f6560179f71", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 807, "likes": 807}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "yahoo.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/politics/", "uuid": "9d73c0206ba9a19212dbefeb81268f6560179f71", "section_title": "Politics | Yahoo News - Latest News &amp; Headlines", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 8, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJlL16c9B7zrbSVFqtncbpE.Pn.yLnn8sMQHNFz.z_kZ7ZieTHr8pqP0PJcKNKR7oztzWr4ahgMARmHzAf2WErUfm5fKaRE73qjt7LN7bAp9l5jHwO2GXNGy4uWeAljrbe", "domain_rank": 5, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WwzzTTofEhJZsRr569MgCQ--/aD00ODA7dz03NDQ7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/5b94cced0405bdbbda18fb44e9abaea7", "site_full": "www.yahoo.com", "title_full": "'Judge sitting on an island': Jeff Sessions dismisses Hawaii court's travel ban ruling", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "'Judge sitting on an island': Jeff Sessions dismisses Hawaii court's travel ban ruling", "published": "2017-04-20T23:11:13.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "hawaii"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "u.s."}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "indiana"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "pacific"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "united states"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "mexico"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "oahu"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "virginia"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "washington"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "jeff sessions"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "marie hirono"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "derrick watson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "george w. bush"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "james robart"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "brian schatz"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "robart"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "curiel"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "gonzalo curiel"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "trump"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "white house"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "senate"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "justice department"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "trump university"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "supreme court"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ninth circuit"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJlL16c9B7zrbSVFqtncbpE.Pn.yLnn8sMQHNFz.z_kZ7ZieTHr8pqP0PJcKNKR7oztzWr4ahgMARmHzAf2WErUfm5fKaRE73qjt7LN7bAp9l5jHwO2GXNGy4uWeAljrbe", "author": "Christopher Wilson", "external_links": ["http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/20/politics/kfile-sessions-psychoanalyze/index.html&quot;", "https://twitter.com/brianschatz/status/855141456062763008&quot;", "https://twitter.com/brianschatz/status/855141456062763008", "http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/20/politics/kfile-sessions-psychoanalyze/index.html"], "title": "'Judge sitting on an island': Jeff Sessions dismisses Hawaii court's travel ban ruling", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Police officer killed, another wounded in Paris shooting By Julien Pretot Share View photos Police secure the Champs Elysee Avenue after one policeman was killed and another wounded in a shooting incident in Paris, France, April 20, 2017. REUTERS/Christian Hartmann More By Julien Pretot PARIS (Reuters) - One policeman was killed and another wounded in a shooting incident in central Paris on Thursday night, a police source said. A person who fired on police on the Champs-Elysees shopping boulevard just days ahead of France's presidential election has been killed, the source said. A police source also said there had been two assailants, and a witness told Reuters that one man got out of a car at the scene and began shooting with a machine gun. Police authorities called on the public to avoid the area. A Reuters reporter saw a helicopter flying low over central Paris, apparently part of a follow-up police operation. French TV channel BFM broadcast footage of the Arc de Triomphe monument and top half of the Champs Elysees packed with police vans, lights flashing and heavily armed police shutting the area down after what was described by one journalist as a major exchange of fire nears a Marks and Spencers store. The incident came as French voters prepared go to the polls on Sunday in the most tightly-contested presidential election in living memory. France has lived under a state of emergency since 2015 and has suffered a spate of Islamist militant attacks that have killed more than 230 people in the past two years. Earlier this week, two men were arrested in Marseille whom police said had been planning an attack ahead of the election. A machine gun, two hand guns and three kilos of TATP explosive were among the weapons found at a flat in the southern city along with jihadist propaganda materials according to the Paris prosecutor.

The Islamic State group quickly claimed responsibility for the attack, which hit just three days before a tense presidential election. Security already has been a dominant theme in the campaign, and the violence on the sparkling avenue threatened to weigh on voters' decisions. Candidates canceled or rescheduled final campaign events ahead of Sunday's first round vote.\nInvestigators searched a home early Friday in an eastern suburb of Paris believed linked to the attack. A police document obtained by The Associated Press identifies the address searched in the town of Chelles as the family home of Karim Cheurfi, a 39-year-old with a criminal record.\nPolice tape surrounded the quiet, middle-class neighborhood in Chelles, and worried neighbors expressed surprise at the searches. Archive reports by French newspaper Le Parisien say that Cheurfi was convicted of attacking a police officer in 2001.\nAuthorities are trying to determine whether \"one or more people\" might have helped the attacker, Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet told reporters at the scene of the shooting.\nOne officer was killed and two police officers were seriously wounded when the attacker emerged from a car and used an automatic weapon to shoot at officers outside a Marks & Spencer's department store at the center of the Champs-Elysees, anti-terrorism prosecutor Francois Molins said.\nA female foreign tourist also was wounded, Molins said.\nThe Islamic State group's claim of responsibility just a few hours after the attack came unusually swiftly for the extremist group, which has been losing territory in Iraq and Syria.\nIn a statement from its Amaq news agency, the group gave a pseudonym for the shooter, Abu Yusuf al-Beljiki, indicating he was Belgian or had lived in Belgium. Belgian authorities said they had no information about the suspect. IS described the shootings as an attack \"in the heart of Paris.\"\nThe attacker had been flagged as an extremist, according to two police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss the investigation.\nBrandet said officers were \"deliberately\" targeted, as has happened repeatedly to French security forces in recent years, including in the run-up to the 2012 election.\nPolice and soldiers sealed off the area, ordering tourists back into hotels and blocking people from approaching the scene.\nEmergency vehicles blocked the wide Champs-Elysees, an avenue lined with boutiques and normally packed with cars and tourists that cuts across central Paris between the Arc de Triomphe and the Tuileries Gardens. Subway stations were closed off.\nThe gunfire sent scores of tourists fleeing into side streets.\n\"They were running, running,\" said 55-year-old Badi Fta\u00efti, who lives in the area. \"Some were crying. There were tens, maybe even hundreds of them.\"\nFrench President Francois Hollande said he was convinced the circumstances of the attack in a country pointed to a terrorist act. Hollande held an emergency meeting with the prime minister Thursday night and planned to convene the defense council Friday morning.\nThe incident recalled two recent attacks on soldiers providing security at prominent locations around Paris: one at the Louvre museum in February and one at Orly airport last month.\nSpeaking in Washington during a news conference with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, U.S. President Donald Trump said the shooting \"looks like another terrorist attack\" and sent condolences to France.\nA French television station hosting an event with the 11 candidates running for president briefly interrupted its broadcast to report the shootings.\nConservative contender Francois Fillon, who has campaigned against \"Islamic totalitarianism,\" said on France 2 television that he was canceling his planned campaign stops Friday.\nFar-right candidate Marine Le Pen, who campaigns against immigration and Islamic fundamentalism, took to Twitter to offer her sympathy for law enforcement officers \"once again targeted.\" She canceled a minor campaign stop, but scheduled another.\nCentrist candidate Emmanuel Macron offered his thoughts to the family of the dead officer.\nSocialist Benoit Hamon tweeted his \"full support\" to police against terrorism.\nThe two top finishers in Sunday's election will advance to a runoff on May 7.\n___\nAssociated Press Writers Angela Charlton and Raphael Satter in Paris, Jeff Schaeffer and Nadine Achoui-Lesage in Chelles, France, and Raf Casert in Brussels contributed to this report.", "crawled": "2017-04-20T22:50:42.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-20T22:50:42.000+03:00", "uuid": "e976d97c72366bb6226260a236b89e068d30f580", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 919, "likes": 919}, "gplus": {"shares": 2}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}}, "country": "US", "site": "yahoo.com", "participants_count": 0, "site_section": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/world/", "uuid": "e976d97c72366bb6226260a236b89e068d30f580", "section_title": "World | Yahoo News - Latest News &amp; Headlines", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 9, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJDbVnaMx47H0BiSkie4Wm6XVEAj6f.N7zUxJvXvcYF2dOh5vdlwHBc3FeDXuwZn2L", "domain_rank": 5, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/w_tcx3k0LYn98I93kWz7aA--/aD0xNjY0O3c9MzAwMDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/15e0948ec3354ba28468df1d1b968c9b.jpg", "site_full": "www.yahoo.com", "title_full": "Paris police say officer and attacker shot, killed", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Paris police say officer and attacker shot, killed", "published": "2017-04-20T22:50:42.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "paris"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "paris"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "franklin roosevelt subway station"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "champs-elysees"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "france"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "johanna primevert"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "neutral", "name": "ap"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "associated press"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJDbVnaMx47H0BiSkie4Wm6XVEAj6f.N7zUxJvXvcYF2dOh5vdlwHBc3FeDXuwZn2L", "author": "", "external_links": [], "title": "Paris police say officer and attacker shot, killed", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "From the girl voted in High School 'least likely to succeed' this sure is a blessing! https://t.co/3EnB8ixB4f \u2014 Dolly Parton (@DollyParton) April 10, 2017 Through her representatives, Ms. Parton declined an interview.\nAccording to Ms. Sacco\u2019s syllabus, the seminar looks at a history of the 20th century not from the vantage point of elites, but through the eyes of Ms. Parton, \u201ca poor white girl born in midcentury Appalachia.\u201d\nIt has a wealth of reading materials, including Ms. Parton\u2019s own 1994 book, \u201c Dolly: My Life and Other Unfinished Business ,\u201d and a slew of contemporary articles from periodicals such as The Tennessee Magazine , The Knoxville News Sentinel and The New York Times .

  Photo Dr. Doris Greenblatt in New York. Dr. Greenblatt participated in the trial because her epilepsy had caused memory problems. Credit Edu Bayer for The New York Times Well-timed pulses from electrodes implanted in the brain can enhance memory in some people, scientists reported on Thursday, in the most rigorous demonstration to date of how a pacemaker-like approach might help reduce symptoms of dementia , head injuries and other conditions.\nThe report is the result of decades of work decoding brain signals, helped along in recent years by large Department of Defense grants intended to develop novel treatments for people with traumatic brain injuries , a signature wound of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. The research, led by a team at the University of Pennsylvania, is published in the journal Current Biology.\nPrevious attempts to stimulate human memory with implanted electrodes had produced mixed results: Some experiments seemed to sharpen memory, but others muddled it. The new paper resolves this confusion by demonstrating that the timing of the stimulation is crucial.\nZapping memory areas when they are functioning poorly improves the brain\u2019s encoding of new information. But doing so when those areas are operating well \u2014 as they do for stretches of the day in most everyone, including those with deficits \u2014 impairs the process.\n  Advertisement\n  \u201cWe all have good days and bad days, times when we\u2019re foggy, or when we\u2019re sharp,\u201d said Michael Kahana, who with Youssef Ezzyat led the research team. \u201cWe found that jostling the system when it\u2019s in a low-functioning state can jump it to a high-functioning one.\u201d\nAdvertisement\n  Researchers cautioned that implantation is a delicate procedure and that the reported improvements may not apply broadly. The study was of epilepsy patients; scientists still have much work to do to determine whether this approach has the same potential in people with other conditions, and if so how best to apply it. But in establishing the importance of timing, the field seems to have turned a corner, experts said.\nExperts said the new report gives scientists a needed blueprint for so-called closed-loop cognitive stimulation: implanted electrodes that both monitor the functional state of memory areas, moment to moment, and deliver pulses only in the very microseconds when they\u2019re helpful. The hope is that such sensitive, timed implants could bolster thinking and memory in a range of conditions, including Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias, as well as deficits from brain injury .\n\u201cThe cool thing about this paper is that they showed why stimulation works in some conditions, and why it doesn\u2019t in others,\u201d said Bradley Voytek, an assistant professor of cognitive science and neuroscience at the University of California, San Diego, who was not involved in the work. \u201cIt gives us a blueprint for moving forward.\u201d\nJustin Sanchez, director of the biotechnologies office at the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , which has doled out some $77 million to advance cognitive stimulation, said: \u201cTo me, this paper is one of the breakthrough moments on this problem, to find locations in the brain to stimulate in this particular way to boost performance.\u201d\nPhoto The right hemisphere of a study participant\u2019s brain. The electrodes are overlaid in blue and the one researchers targeted for stimulation is toward the right, highlighted in yellow. Credit Youssef Ezzyat The new study is the latest chapter in an extraordinary, decades-long collaboration among cognitive scientists, brain surgeons and people with severe epilepsy being evaluated for an operation. The preoperative \u201cevaluation\u201d is a fishing expedition of sorts, in which doctors sink an array of electrodes through the top of the skull and wait for a seizure to occur, to see whether it\u2019s operable. Many of the electrodes sit in or near memory areas, and the wait can take weeks in the hospital. Cognitive scientists use this opportunity, with patients\u2019 consent, to present memory tests and take recordings.\nThis approach \u2014 called direct neural recording, and piggybacking entirely on the clinical placement of the electrodes \u2014 has become the leading edge of research into the biology of human memory. This study used data from 150 patients, and had 20 collaborators from institutions around the country, including Emory University, the University of Washington, the Mayo Clinic and the University of California, San Francisco.\nIn a series of experiments, the researchers had patients memorize lists of words and later, after a distraction, asked them to freely recall as many of the words as they could. All the while, the scientists monitored a handful of \u201chot spots\u201d in the brain which, previous work had shown, were strongly related to memory encoding. Before the stimulation tests, the team determined the precise settings for each patient\u2019s high- and low-functioning states.\n\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Privacy Policy Each participant carried out the word-memorization tests repeatedly, with different words every time; some lists were memorized with brain stimulation, and other lists with no stimulation, which served as a control. The authors then examined memory performance based on whether stimulation arrived during low- compared with high-functioning brain states.\nThe team then statistically analyzed the results and found that people scored slightly higher than usual on words when stimulation arrived during a low or foggy state \u2014 and worse, when the pulse arrived in a high state. \u201cThe average enhancement effect was about 12 to 13 percent,\u201d Dr. Kahana said. \u201cAnd when stimulation arrived in a good state, the average was about 15 to 20 percent worse than usual.\u201d\nAdvertisement\n  Dr. Doris Greenblatt, a psychiatrist who participated in the trial at Emory, said she sought the surgery because her epilepsy had long caused memory problems. \u201cEach seizure I had tore at the fabric of memory, and it was as if my memories weren\u2019t attached to anything,\u201d Dr. Greenblatt said.\nShe agreed to the memory testing for the study. \u201cIt was a little humiliating, to be honest,\u201d she said of the testing. \u201cI would remember one or two items from a list of objects in a kitchen, for instance, then think, \u2018Oh no, what else was there?\u2019 \u201d\nShe said she had no idea whether the electrodes in her brain were stimulating or not. \u201cAll I can say is that it was exhausting, and I worried about how I was doing.\u201d She had the surgery for her epilepsy a year ago, with Dr. Robert Gross, and has not had a seizure since; her memory is also improved, she said.\nThe timed component in this study represented a clear break from previous approaches. In 2014 the Defense Department had funded another group testing stimulation in epilepsy patients \u2014 directly to a brain area near the hippocampus, which is crucial to memory formation. That approach did not take into account brain states, the high and low function, and it was not successful.\n\u201cTo me,\u201d said Dr. Voytek, the new approach \u201cis a clear demarcation that the era of dumb stimulators is over.\u201d\n  We\u2019re interested in your feedback on this page.

That is equivalent to one year of a rich new four-year deal that O'Reilly finalized earlier this year. The network and its parent company, 21st Century Fox, completed the deal with knowledge that a New York Times story would reveal settlements with women who accused The O'Reilly Factor star of harassment after the ouster last summer of founding CEO Roger Ailes amid his own sexual harassment scandal. Ailes left last July with a $40 million payout, the remainder owed on his contract. O'Reilly has vehemently denied the allegations and said that he settled the claims to spare his children the inevitable public mudslinging. O'Reilly was a tabloid staple for two weeks back in 2004 when an associate producer at The O'Reilly Factor filed a sexual harassment claim against him. The claim was settled for $9 million. But inside Fox News, the timing of the most recent payouts caused \"outrage\" and \"disappointment,\" said staffers, especially among female employees who felt the company's financial decisions were not aligning with their public statements about \"respect and dignity\" in the workplace.

In a statement released Wednesday, O'Reilly noted: \"I will always look back on my time at Fox with great pride in the unprecedented success we achieved and with my deepest gratitude to all my dedicated viewers. I wish only the best for Fox News Channel.\" In announcing O'Reilly's departure on The O'Reilly Factor, April 19, substitute anchor Dana Perino characterized him as the \"undisputed king of cable news.\" Indeed, he was the linchpin in the network's highly lucrative primetime lineup, where his show was the No. 1 cable news program for 16 years and this year was averaging close to 4 million viewers each night. \"He is an incredibly talented broadcaster who raised the bar for interviewers everywhere,\" said Perino. \"It is the end of an era here at Fox News Channel.\" ", "crawled": "2017-04-20T22:22:13.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-20T22:22:13.000+03:00", "uuid": "2b145d15e2a69b2fed099e6413235755b94bfda1", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 741, "likes": 741}, "gplus": {"shares": 4}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "yahoo.com", "participants_count": 0, "site_section": "", "uuid": "2b145d15e2a69b2fed099e6413235755b94bfda1", "section_title": "", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 7, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giTQeApecVVvUoD7aSnLzrw20P3BfYQgoll_k_ud.yEbgwYk51uGXWQNg.QrY8BAH8iFX8TWKqCOrQeIXKcbGrYv.cqfnkXqGEg--", "domain_rank": 5, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MOqiJ19DKeNRjrj90sLfXQ--/aD0zNjA7dz02NDA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-us/video/video.insideeditioncbs.com/d832f41e33224f2cbdfc7d72225169ed", "site_full": "www.yahoo.com", "title_full": "Bill O'Reilly Paid $25 Million in Fox News Exit Deal [Video]", "spam_score": 0.041, "title": "Bill O'Reilly Paid $25 Million in Fox News Exit Deal [Video]", "published": "2017-04-20T22:22:13.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "exit deal marisa guthrie the hollywood"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "bill o'reilly"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dana perino"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "perino"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "o'reilly"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "roger ailes"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ailes"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "fox"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "fox news exit deal"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "fox news"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "21st century fox"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "fox news channel"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "new york times"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giTQeApecVVvUoD7aSnLzrw20P3BfYQgoll_k_ud.yEbgwYk51uGXWQNg.QrY8BAH8iFX8TWKqCOrQeIXKcbGrYv.cqfnkXqGEg--", "author": "Marisa Guthrie", "external_links": [], "title": "Bill O'Reilly Paid $25 Million in Fox News Exit Deal [Video]", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Still reeling from a bruising loss on health care , Republicans return to work after a two-week recess Monday with just five days to whip their fractious caucus into line and avoid a government shutdown. Funding for the federal government runs out on Friday, which coincidentally marks President Trump\u2019s 100th day in office. Republicans, who control both houses of Congress and the White House, likely need at least a few Democratic votes in the House to pass the spending bill, and will definitely need some Democrats in the Senate to back their plan.\nGOP leaders are working on a compromise bill that avoids sparking a Democratic rebellion but also doesn\u2019t alienate Trump , who\u2019s asked for big hikes in defense spending as well as $3 billion for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and other immigration enforcement. Politico recently reported that the White House is doubling down on its border wall request , despite Democrats calling it a \u201cpoison pill\u201d they won\u2019t swallow.\n\u201cAs far as keeping the government open, I want to keep the government open, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d Trump said when asked about the vote in a press conference Thursday.\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters this week that Trump\u2019s immigration enforcement demands should be debated in the full 2018 budget rather than the planned spending bill, which will likely only fund the government for five months.\n\u201cWe think that the immigration issue should be discussed in the 2018 budget where there\u2019s votes and discussions \u2014 that nothing should shut down people\u2019s votes,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cThat would apply to the main immigration issues that are before us, not just the wall.\u201d\nIn press conferences, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has suggested she would be open to spending on border \u201ctechnology\u201d and personnel. But she dismissed the wall as impractical.\n\u201cIf they want to invest in more personnel or more technology or something like that, that might make some sense,\u201d she said in February. \u201cBut a wall?\u201d\nRepublican leaders appeared to be backing away from the wall last month. In March, Sen. Roy Blunt told reporters the president\u2019s funding requests would likely be passed later as a separate bill. Sen. Majority Leader Mitch McConnel has also said he plans to pass a \u201cclean\u201d funding bill, suggesting he doesn\u2019t want to add on too many extras that could complicate its passage.\nBut if Trump continues to demand wall funding, it could change that calculus \u2014 setting up next week to be a bitter showdown between the parties as the clock ticks before the shutdown.\nIn a press conference Thursday, the president did not appear to be spoiling for a fight. \u201cAs far as keeping the government open, I want to keep the government open, don\u2019t you agree?\u201d he asked.\nBut Trump also told reporters Thursday that he wanted the lawmakers to deliver both a spending deal and a new vote on the Obamacare repeal and replace deal next week or the following week, potentially setting up another clash between Congress and the White House. \u201cWe have a good chance of getting it soon, I\u2019d like to say next week,\u201d Trump said of a new vote on healthcare. With the budget deadline looming, Republican lawmakers do not appear to be in the same hurry.\nConservatives in Washington are anxiously waiting to see what happens next week. Many of them hope Republicans are able to quickly pass a funding bill without devolving into infighting along moderate-conservative lines, like last month when the health care bill abruptly fell apart . It\u2019s unclear if conservative House Freedom Caucus members will decide to put up a fight over the budget measure if it doesn\u2019t contain sufficient spending cuts. And if the GOP leadership decides to avoid the wall fight, border hawks like Rep. Steve King could also decide to kick up a fuss.\nView photos\nWorkers raising a taller fence along the Mexico-U.S. border. (Photo illustration: Yahoo News; photo: Christian Torres/AP) More \u201cNo one wants this fight,\u201d said one leader of a conservative advocacy group who did not wish to be named. \u201cIf they can\u2019t handle this, we need to break the glass and pull the handle.\u201d\nRepublican Rep. Mike Kelly told Yahoo News that the GOP is aware that it will \u201crise or fall\u201d based upon its ability to govern. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be able to reach an agreement, I really do,\u201d Kelly said of the spending bill.\nLiz Mair, a political consultant in Washington, said the \u201chardcore libertarian\u201d in her wishes conservatives would put up a fight over government spending, but she doubts it will happen.\n\u201cThe wall is probably the closest thing to an actual sticking point, but I\u2019m not even convinced that will be a big deal when push comes to shove,\u201d Mair wrote in an email. \u201cI\u2019d love to be proved wrong and see conservatives press for real spending restraint (now and in future), but I don\u2019t think members of Congress agree with me on that one.\u201d\nThe wall isn\u2019t the only potential stumbling block to negotiations. The White House is also reportedly pushing to attach a rider that would block federal funding to so-called sanctuary cities that do not help enforce federal immigration law to the bill. Another potential catch: Wary of potential White House efforts to undermine Obamacare , Democrats want the funding bill to include at least some of the billions of dollars the government owes to health insurance companies. House Republicans have sued over these payments , saying they are illegal. Democrats have also said any defunding of Planned Parenthood, long a conservative priority, would be a \u201cpoison pill\u201d leading them to reject the measure.\nRepublicans could also decide to buy themselves more time to work out their budget differences by temporarily extending government funding for a week or more.\nKelly said he believes Democrats will be blamed for a shutdown if any of these issues becomes fatal and they don\u2019t reach a compromise. \u201cI think the American people are becoming more savvy as to how the government works, and where the logjams are,\u201d he said.", "crawled": "2017-04-20T22:07:50.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-20T22:07:50.000+03:00", "uuid": "0829bfa3e40e07ac27e05a997698bf33148b536a", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 511, "likes": 511}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}}, "country": "US", "site": "yahoo.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/politics/", "uuid": "0829bfa3e40e07ac27e05a997698bf33148b536a", "section_title": "Politics | Yahoo News - Latest News &amp;

The study was of epilepsy patients; scientists still have much work to do to determine whether this approach has the same potential in people with other conditions, and if so how best to apply it. But in establishing the importance of timing, the field seems to have turned a corner, experts said. Experts said the new report gives scientists a needed blueprint for so-called closed-loop cognitive stimulation: implanted electrodes that both monitor the functional state of memory areas, moment to moment, and deliver pulses only in the very microseconds when they\u2019re helpful. The hope is that such sensitive, timed implants could bolster thinking and memory in a range of conditions, including Alzheimer\u2019s and other dementias, as well as deficits from brain injury . \u201cThe cool thing about this paper is that they showed why stimulation works in some conditions, and why it doesn\u2019t in others,\u201d said Bradley Voytek, an assistant professor of cognitive science and neuroscience at the University of California, San Diego, who was not involved in the work. \u201cIt gives us a blueprint for moving forward.\u201d Justin Sanchez, director of the biotechnologies office at the Pentagon\u2019s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , which has doled out some $77 million to advance cognitive stimulation, said: \u201cTo me, this paper is one of the breakthrough moments on this problem, to find locations in the brain to stimulate in this particular way to boost performance.\u201d Photo The right hemisphere of a study participant\u2019s brain. The electrodes are overlaid in blue and the one researchers targeted for stimulation is toward the right, highlighted in yellow. Credit Youssef Ezzyat The new study is the latest chapter in an extraordinary, decades-long collaboration among cognitive scientists, brain surgeons and people with severe epilepsy being evaluated for an operation. The preoperative \u201cevaluation\u201d is a fishing expedition of sorts, in which doctors sink an array of electrodes through the top of the skull and wait for a seizure to occur, to see whether it\u2019s operable. Many of the electrodes sit in or near memory areas, and the wait can take weeks in the hospital. Cognitive scientists use this opportunity, with patients\u2019 consent, to present memory tests and take recordings. This approach \u2014 called direct neural recording, and piggybacking entirely on the clinical placement of the electrodes \u2014 has become the leading edge of research into the biology of human memory. This study used data from 150 patients, and had 20 collaborators from institutions around the country, including Emory University, the University of Washington, the Mayo Clinic and the University of California, San Francisco. In a series of experiments, the researchers had patients memorize lists of words and later, after a distraction, asked them to freely recall as many of the words as they could. All the while, the scientists monitored a handful of \u201chot spots\u201d in the brain which, previous work had shown, were strongly related to memory encoding. Before the stimulation tests, the team determined the precise settings for each patient\u2019s high- and low-functioning states. Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Bigot walks. Drew Angerer via Getty Images Color of Change's campaign for advertisers to boycott Bill O' Reilly began in March 2015. \nWhen Fox News failed to hold former anchor Bill O\u2019 Reilly accountable for his prejudicial banter on the network, Color Of Change (COC), a racial justice advocacy group, decided to organize against O\u2019Reilly and his plaftform. \nThe organization, which dedicates itself to issues of racial inequality, took issue with O\u2019Reilly\u2019s ongoing race-baiting . A 2006 broadcast in which O\u2019Reilly claimed he was attacked during the LA riots was reputed to be a lie by several of his former colleagues in 2015. \nIn March of that year, COC began an advertising boycott urging companies to pull ads airing during \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor.\u201d The campaign, which fluctuated in momentum throughout its first two years, gained traction last month after O\u2019Reilly inappropriately remarked that Congresswoman Maxine Waters\u2019 hair looked like a wig that the late James Brown would sport. \nBut months prior to O\u2019Reilly\u2019s comments on Waters, a wave of allegations that he sexually harassed former Fox employees began to make headlines. After these allegations were made public, a former black Fox employee came forward alleging that O\u2019Reilly would \u201cgrunt\u201d at her \u201clike a wild boar\u201d and addressed her as \u201chot chocolate.\u201d \nWith the added momentum, the campaign became even more effective in persuading companies to pull their advertisements from the program. Just two weeks ago, Nutrisystem told COC that they had no plans to buy ad time during \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d after corresponding with the organization. \nThe organization\u2019s executive director Rashad Robinson told The Huffington Post on Wednesday that O\u2019Reilly\u2019s belittlement of Waters and the allegations of sexual harassment \u201csignified a new moment\u201d for the campaign. Bill Clark via Getty Images Rashad Robinson is the executive director at Color Of Change. \n\u201cIn many ways, it was just one more example of the dehumanizing way that he treats women and black people,\u201d Robinson told HuffPost. \u201cYou have a person who does these types of things off-air and then goes on-air and talks about people who don\u2019t work.\u201d \nDespite the first instance of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s alleged sexual predation being bought to the company\u2019s attention in 2002 , he remained on-air. But O\u2019Reilly\u2019s knack for prejudicial rhetoric wasn\u2019t an off-air matter. \nAs the members of the organization worked on behalf of issues of racial injustice across the country, Robinson said they couldn\u2019t ignore O\u2019Reilly\u2019s problematic nature because of the sheer ubiquity of Fox programming. \n\u201cThe thing about Fox News is it\u2019s such a powerful and visible platform,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just something that people have to sort of seek out, but it\u2019s on when you\u2019re in the airport in some places, it\u2019s on at the gym...\u201d \nWhich, Robinson said, is exactly why O\u2019Reilly\u2019s rhetoric was so dangerous. \n\u201cWhat people see and hear in the media has a tremendous effect on what they do every day as well as what\u2019s accessible and allowed in the media space sends a powerful message about the rules of our society,\u201d Robinson continued. \nRobinson said that before mobilizing against corporations, they first reach out to company executives through phone and email to urge that they act with accountability.

By Ryan Grim , Igor Bobic   campaigns on March 10 in Livingston, Montana. Quist is campaigning for the House of Representatives seat vacated by newly appointed Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke. \nWASHINGTON \u2015 Two days after a surprisingly strong showing in a Georgia special election, congressional Democrats are adding a new race to their list of priorities: a contest in Montana that pits local musical legend Rob Quist against businessman and creationist Greg Gianforte. \nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is making an initial six-figure investment into the Montana state party to back Quist\u2019s campaign, DCCC spokeswoman Meredith Kelly told The Huffington Post. \nIt will be left to the state party and the campaign to decide how best to use the funds, whether on mail, television or door-knocking operations. The spending is in the low six figures, but is unlikely to be the last cash infusion from the national party as attention increasingly turns to the state\u2019s race. \nCloser-than-expected finishes by Democrats in Kansas and Georgia have left progressive grassroots activists feeling more emboldened than ever, demanding that the national party compete in areas that once seemed impossible. Liberal blogging website Daily Kos and its contributors, for example, have stepped up where reluctant Democrats have not \u2015 sending more than $1 million to help flip an ultraconservative district in Georgia held consistently by the GOP since the late 1970s. \nUnlike the election in Kansas, where Democrats didn\u2019t jump into the race until the eve of the election for fear of their involvement being used against candidate James Thompson, Quist\u2019s campaign is getting some help more than a month from Election Day. \nThe support doesn\u2019t stop at that. Actress Alyssa Milano will join Quist on the trail next week, she told HuffPost. Milano, who is filming in Atlanta, was active on behalf of Jon Ossoff there. \nThe DCCC is not yet running ads in Montana, but the difference in strategy reflects how much attention the race has already received, and thus less need for worry about support from national Democrats hurting Quist\u2019s campaign. (Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), for example, is set to campaign for Quist next month.) \nThe move may also signal Democrats\u2019 eagerness for a win after having fallen short in two consecutive elections, first in Kansas and then in Georgia . \nThe special election to fill the seat vacated by newly appointed Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke is scheduled to take place May 25. \nClarification : Language has been amended to more accurately describe the results of the vote in the recent special election in Georgia. \nThis article has been updated with comment from Milano.

After Mr. Zarrab was charged a year ago, his case became a focus of Mr. Erdogan. The Turkish president claimed last year that there were \u201cmalicious\u201d intentions in the prosecution, and he raised the matter with then-Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. during talks at the United Nations, according to Turkish news reports. On March 30, during a visit to Ankara, Turkey, by Rex W. Tillerson, the American secretary of state, Turkey\u2019s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, accused Preet Bharara , who was the United States attorney in Manhattan when Mr. Zarrab was arrested, of being a pawn of anti-Turkish forces. Mr. Bharara, who had been fired by Mr. Trump three weeks earlier, said after Mr. Cavusoglu\u2019s comments, \u201cI am not going to comment on false and silly political propaganda by a foreign official regarding a case that I no longer oversee.\u201d Photo Mr. Zarrab in Istanbul in 2013.

Mukasey, a former attorney general in the George W. Bush administration, was revealed in letters filed last month to the judge. In one letter, Mr. Zarrab\u2019s lead lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, wrote, \u201cTheir roles will not require any appearance in court.\u201d The judge, Richard M. Berman of Federal District Court, asked Mr. Brafman to provide affidavits from Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Mukasey describing the work they had been retained to perform on Mr. Zarrab\u2019s behalf. The judge said the affidavits, particularly if they contained privileged information, could be filed under seal and ex parte, meaning the government would also not be able to see them. Mr. Brafman said on Wednesday evening that he had filed affidavits from both lawyers in that manner, but then, at the judge\u2019s direction, refiled them publicly. \u201cThe affidavits speak for themselves,\u201d Mr. Brafman said.

(Photo: Ron Verhorst/Redferns) More When Michael Pagnotta launched his own PR firm, Reach Media, in early 1990s, Prince was his very first client. Now, more than a quarter-century later and one year after Prince\u2019s tragic death, Pagnotta remembers, in this exclusive personal essay for Yahoo Music, a fateful day in Australia when Prince confronted him and gave him some advice that changed his life and career.\n\u201cMichael, get your pen and paper and meet me in my dressing room.\u201d\nPrince was a man of famously few words, spending most his time \u2014 and mine, when I was representing him \u2014 refusing interviews rather than granting them. But as the first anniversary of his death arrives, I have had occasion to ponder a few words he did say to me. Words that changed my life.\nThe year was 1992. We were in Australia as part of the Diamonds and Pearls concert tour and things were going well, at least I thought so, until Prince came up behind me one night backstage and \u201csuggested\u201d a meeting. Before I could even turn around to respond, he was gone, vanishing as he often did \u2014 sometimes behind a wall of bodyguards, other times into thin air, like magic, leaving you wondering where the hell he\u2019d gone.\nI\u2019d figured out pretty quickly in my relationship with Paisley Park that the less actual personal contact you had with Prince, the better off you were. It meant he was cool with you and what you were doing. This meeting wasn\u2019t a good sign, and I started to think about what time the next plane home might be leaving and whether or not I\u2019d be on it.\nRelated: Prince Deliverance EP Blocked as Estate, Producers Spar in Court\nI did as he said, and got a pen and paper and headed to his dressing room, running obsessively through every \u201cI\u2019m sorry and I will do better!\u201d scenario I could imagine. Prince\u2019s half-brother and right-hand man Dwayne met me at the dressing room door and instructed me to enter and sit. Prince would be right with me.\nMichael Pagnotta\u2019s Prince mementos from over the years. (Photo courtesy of Michael Pagnotta) More Prince\u2019s dressing room was just as you\u2019d imagine it: a serene space decked out, if memory serves, in gold statuettes, scented candles, incense, caftans, throws, carpets. Splashes of yellow, purple, and gold everywhere. Part temple, part ancient desert caravan tent straight out of Ben Hur . In the center of the room was a couch, and I sat. The seat was broken and I sunk in, feeling like I might just fall through to the floor.\nAfter a few anxious minutes, Prince walked in, still dressed in his canary-yellow jumpsuit, do-rag, and boots from the show. The man had just performed a two-and-a-half-hour gig and he was perfectly coiffed and done up, looking like he\u2019d barely broken a sweat. If anything, I was the one who was sweating. Prince was a small guy, but with me sinking ever deeper into the broken seat cushions like a dying man in quicksand and having to look up at him, he looked like a giant. Intimidating.\nThere were no pleasantries. He got right down to business. He began to shift his weight from one leg to another, in a slow, metronomic dance as he interrogated me.\n\u201cHow many T-shirts we sell tonight?\u201d he asked, staring me right in the eye.\nThe question surprised me. I didn\u2019t sell T-shirts for the tour and had no access to the merch data, especially before the show had even settled. I didn\u2019t know, couldn\u2019t have known, but he made me feel like I should have. He was good at keeping people off balance.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said honestly and sheepishly.\nPrince let the uncertainty hang in the air for a second and started to speed up his dance, circling me as I sat, looking less like a canary in his yellow outfit than a bird of prey. He came around the front of me and stopped, looked me dead in the eye again.\nRead More \u201cHow many programs we sell?\u201d\nTo say I was freaking at this point would be an understatement. I didn\u2019t sell T-shirts or programs. Surely he knew that. The shows had sold out quickly and fans were stoked to see him and his new band, the New Power Generation. The singles were breaking strong at radio and the album was setting up to be Prince\u2019s best seller since Purple Rain \u2014 no small achievement, and one in which I took a lot of pride. Everything was going well, including the merch sales, as far as I knew. Where he was going, I still couldn\u2019t figure. Without meaning to be a wiseass, I answered with a clarification.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you know this, but I don\u2019t do merch for you. I do publicity.\u201d\nWrong answer. He stopped dancing in mid-twirl, turned his back toward me, then spun suddenly around, faced me and pointed his finger accusingly.\n\u201cYou trying to say that\u2019s not your job?\u201d\nI tried to respond with something positive about what my job actually was, as far as I was concerned.\n\u201cThe press has been\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou gonna talk, or you wanna listen?\u201d\nHe slowed down his question, emphasizing each word.\n\u201cAre you trying to say \u2026 that\u2019s not \u2026 your job ?\u201d\nAnd then it hit me. I\u2019d watched him record through the night, jam for hours in tiny clubs after grueling arena gigs, rehearse the horn section for two hours over four bars of music, replace band members of opening act Carmen Electra (yes, that Carmen Electra) with members of the NPG one by one, adjust the soundboard, and leave explicit Do Not Touch orders for a professional soundman he was paying to do sound on tour. In the studio, and on stage, everything was his job. The band, the instruments, the sound, the lights, the costumes, the set, the visuals. Likewise, he was saying to me that everything was my job. Performance, publicity, and programs were all connected, all part of the same larger whole. It was a true light-bulb moment for me. In an age of specialization, of boundaries, of not wanting to step on anyone else\u2019s toes, Prince insisted on things getting done no matter who had to do it. Or how. Your job description was: everything .\n\u201cIt\u2019s all my job,\u201d I replied simply, finally getting it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all your job,\u201d he repeated, flashing a sly half-smile and pointing to the door. \u201cBye.\u201d\nEven the conversation had been a performance for him. But a learning experience for me.\nI walked out of the dressing room with my head spinning. I was a young publicist whose first client in his own business was one of the biggest pop stars in the world. I\u2019d been feeling pretty good about myself and the way I did my job. But that conversation changed everything about the way I looked at myself and my business. There have been countless recollections from fans and critics and colleagues of Prince\u2019s, all citing how inspirational he and his music were to them and to the world. Thankfully, the reunited Revolution and New Power Generation will keep his greatest legacy, his music, alive in the coming months and years. But when I think of Prince, it\u2019s not only the inspiration but the perspiration I think about. For me, you can sum up his legacy in one word: Work.\nI\u2019d come into Prince\u2019s orbit after he\u2019d already achieved his greatest commercial and critical successes \u2014 1999 , Purple Rain , Sign O\u2019 the Times \u2014 and just following the relative disappointment of the Graffiti Bridge album and film. It was the very early \u201990s. Music was changing. Prince\u2019s brand of funky eclecticism was on the verge of falling out of fashion. Hip-hop and grunge were taking over. A lesser artist, or less competitive one, might have thrown up his hands, given up, or given in, content to rest on a well-earned reputation. But instead, Prince changed everything.\nHe formed a new band, the New Power Generation, and forged a new sound \u2014 adding Tony Mosley, a rapper, to the mix, finding a place for hip-hop in his new music. He changed his image, complete with new updo hairstyle and dandified outfits designed specifically for him in his own wardrobe department at Paisley Park. Flannel shirts and baggy jeans, trends at that time, simply would not do. He brought dancers Diamond and Pearl on board to up the eye candy quotient in the \u201cGett Off\u201d and \u201cCream\u201d videos and in live performances. Finally he added a belly dancer, Mayte, his muse and future wife, to the NPG mix, instructing me to tell press at various tour stops that he\u2019d kidnapped her from a foreign land.\nRelated: Mayte Garcia Opens Up About Child She Lost With Prince: \u2018I Don\u2019t Think He Ever Got Over It\u2019\nEach of these changes were tools he gave me. Tools I used to help Diamonds and Pearls become the second-biggest album of Prince\u2019s career. The Prince from the Dirty Mind and Purple Rain and Batman days was gone, replaced by a butt-baring ringmaster of the funkiest circus in the universe. Yes, he\u2019d changed everything. Eventually, he would even change his name. But that\u2019s another story.\nIn the end, work was the key to Prince\u2019s success, perhaps as much as his raw talent. You don\u2019t leave an immense recorded catalog or a vault with hundreds, maybe thousands, of unreleased songs unless you work . You don\u2019t earn a reputation as one of the greatest musicians, stage performers, and songwriters ever unless you work.\nAnother client of mine, George Michael, once complained to me that Prince didn\u2019t \u201cedit\u201d himself well enough , releasing too much, too fast. I think George missed the point. Sometimes, it is about output \u2014 asking your fans to drink not from a fountain, but from a fire hose. Do it, label and critics be damned, and move on to the next thing. Prince did that, whether the chart-keepers were paying attention or not, in a decades-long burst of Warholian productivity. Is there any one of us, now that he is gone, who wishes Prince had taken it all easier, had worked less?\nIt\u2019s all your job . Teamwork is fine, but every team needs a leader. If you want to be successful, you have to be aware of it all, stay on top of it all, be responsible for it all, willing to do it all. That was his daunting message, and over the years it has served me well. So the words that I\u2019d once feared might be a dire warning turned out instead to be life-changing wisdom that I have carried with me ever since. Much has been made of Prince\u2019s media silence in those years, but that simple lesson is more memorable to me than anything he ever said to Rolling Stone , Spin , Vibe , or any other interview. In fact, it\u2019s what I remember most.\nWhen it came to business, I\u2019m proud and humbled to say everything I needed to know about the music business, and maybe even life, I learned from working with Prince.", "crawled": "2017-04-20T21:28:17.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-20T21:28:17.000+03:00", "uuid": "a7376bd1e97908a6e2cf274b6ca1cd9652c1e7cf", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 533, "likes": 533}, "gplus": {"shares": 3}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 5}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 28}}, "country": "US", "site": "yahoo.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "https://www.yahoo.com/music/rss", "uuid": "a7376bd1e97908a6e2cf274b6ca1cd9652c1e7cf", "section_title": "Yahoo Music", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 5, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90gifk4Q7H1MVIjZ9C0uc26yQ09s88q3G0v4Y1bbW1_8VAkH.cBvF0MalCGJQ0Ilt1k.xXApMVFUYfPYt4wVV2ArJYzGzY7mSTknZFtAd.e_kTm11aFJmiQxyjKgZ2a68tWYV1szBVY2taY1tVu4.uyNe1BLS_trOa9zg--", "domain_rank": 5, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7SLazXXDa3efPGJKJEtf8g--/aD0xMzM2O3c9MjA0ODtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/4854e498c4734563c4f525a496b56e03", "site_full": "www.yahoo.com", "title_full": "Prince\u2019s Former Publicist: \u2018Everything I Needed to Know, I Learned From Prince\u2019", "spam_score": 0.071, "title": "Prince\u2019s Former Publicist: \u2018Everything I Needed to Know, I Learned From Prince\u2019", "published": "2017-04-20T21:28:17.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "pearl"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "paisley park"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "australia"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "prince"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "ron verhorst/redferns"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ben hur"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dwayne"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "batman"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "carmen electra"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "mayte garcia"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "george michael"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "chael pagnotta"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "george"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "pagnotta"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "michael"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "mayte"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "tony mosley"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "new power generation"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "npg"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "times"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "rolling stone"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "producers spar in court"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "reach media"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "yahoo music"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90gifk4Q7H1MVIjZ9C0uc26yQ09s88q3G0v4Y1bbW1_8VAkH.cBvF0MalCGJQ0Ilt1k.xXApMVFUYfPYt4wVV2ArJYzGzY7mSTknZFtAd.e_kTm11aFJmiQxyjKgZ2a68tWYV1szBVY2taY1tVu4.uyNe1BLS_trOa9zg--", "author": "Michael Pagnotta", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ujGAbxl3BFHzjz1az_hTbg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/4854e498c4734563c4f525a496b56e03"], "title": "Prince\u2019s Former Publicist: \u2018Everything I Needed to Know, I Learned From Prince\u2019", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "CVS is ditching controversial chemicals from its brand beauty products. (Photo: CVS) More Talk about spring cleaning . CVS announced plans Thursday to remove controversial chemicals \u2014 parabens, phthalates, and formaldehyde donors (preservative ingredients that can release formaldehyde over time) \u2014 from store-brand products, including nearly 600 beauty and personal care items from CVS Health , Beauty 360 , Essence of Beauty , and Blade product lines. The Promise Organic line currently on shelves doesn\u2019t contain any of these potential toxins. \u201cWe completed extensive consumer research, and these were the ingredients our customers were most concerned about,\u201d Cia Tucci, vice president of store brands and quality assurance at CVS Health, tells Yahoo Beauty. \u201cWe embarked on an extensive process to ensure we could maintain product efficacy while removing these ingredients,\u201d she adds. The mega-retailer engaged a third party to help it to understand consumer feedback via social media and focus groups, among other forms of research. Look for the new, cleaner products to roll out in CVS stores in the coming months, with all shipments that don\u2019t meet the new standards to cease completely by the end of 2019. You\u2019ll be able to recognize the new formulas by the redesigned packaging that will call out the free-from characteristics, explains Tucci. CVS has also made the current list of restricted substances available on its website, and it will continue to update the list so that customers can stay informed of which ingredients are now restricted, by product category. Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families (SCHF), a consumer advocacy group, played a pivotal role in convincing the retail giant to clean up its grooming products. \u201cWe\u2019ve been meeting with CVS over the past few years and offering recommendations \u2026 to safeguard our health from toxic chemicals linked to cancer, reproductive health problems , and learning and developmental disabilities,\u201d Mike Schade, Mind the Store campaign director for SCHF, tells Yahoo Beauty. \u201cWe have appreciated CVS\u2019s openness to engage with our coalition, and applaud their transparency and leadership,\u201d he adds. While all personal products on CVS shelves currently meet FDA standards \u2014 as would those of all major drugstore chains \u2014 Schade says that a growing body of scientific evidence has linked exposure to toxic chemicals in everyday products to an epidemic of the above-mentioned diseases on the rise. \u201cA recent peer-reviewed study found that exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals such as flame retardants, phthalates, and bisphenol A (BPA) cost the United States more than $340 billion in health costs a year,\u201d says Schade. It\u2019s a happy day for ingredient-conscious consumers and advocacy groups who are celebrating CVS\u2019s actions, since the initiative could help drive a mass industry race to the top to promote safer, green chemistry solutions. \u201cWe hope other large retailers like Walgreens will follow suit and develop policies to phase out these chemicals in their products,\u201d says Schade. \u201cRetailers can play an important role in working with their suppliers to eliminate harmful chemicals , just like CVS Health is doing with their own brand products.\u201d Read more from Yahoo Style & Beauty:", "crawled": "2017-04-20T21:09:02.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-20T21:09:02.000+03:00", "uuid": "25d987e9d2607b0b925be13ce87df8e70ba11e0a", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 890, "likes": 890}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 6}}, "country": "US", "site": "yahoo.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "https://www.yahoo.com/beauty/rss", "uuid": "25d987e9d2607b0b925be13ce87df8e70ba11e0a", "section_title": "Yahoo Beauty", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 8, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giaTCYNkPzYz3i6ydEPbgcFqY_ij_pfd7gHF53mzYbPmMJtAbGeBgFKADeBVw5rZKMMJCHDgWegUquGl9E4MxCSyCtQCcS3e_cg--", "domain_rank": 5, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8MQRkI9aoG0uG40DkjPFpQ--/aD01NTg7dz03NDQ7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/692a9b2b88f01b23c67ce1b994b9e928", "site_full": "www.yahoo.com", "title_full": "CVS Says No More to Beauty Products With Toxic Chemicals", "spam_score": 0.923, "title": "CVS Says No More to Beauty Products With Toxic Chemicals", "published": "2017-04-20T21:09:02.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "united states"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "cia tucci"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "mike schade"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "mind the store"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "schade"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "tucci"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "cvs"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "fda"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "bpa"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cvs health"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "healthy families"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "instagram"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "safer chemicals"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "facebook"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "yahoo beauty"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "walgreens"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giaTCYNkPzYz3i6ydEPbgcFqY_ij_pfd7gHF53mzYbPmMJtAbGeBgFKADeBVw5rZKMMJCHDgWegUquGl9E4MxCSyCtQCcS3e_cg--", "author": "Grace Gold", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/yahoobeauty", "http://www.cvs.com/shop/brand-shop/p/promise/N-cwcf7j&quot;", "https://www.pinterest.com/yahoostyle/&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tLD4oZk242TD_4PvRrSRMg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NTU4/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/692a9b2b88f01b23c67ce1b994b9e928", "https://www.cvshealth.com/&quot;", "https://www.pinterest.com/yahoostyle/", "https://twitter.com/yahoostyle", "https://www.cvs.com/gbiSearch/?searchTerm=essence%20of%20beauty", "https://www.facebook.com/yahoostylebeauty&quot;", "https://www.cvs.com/gbiSearch/?searchTerm=essence%20of%20beauty&quot;", "https://www.cvshealth.com/", "https://www.instagram.com/yahoostylebeauty/&quot;", "http://www.cvs.com/shop/brand-shop/p/promise/N-cwcf7j", "https://www.facebook.com/yahoostylebeauty", "https://cvshealth.com/sites/default/files/cvs-health-restricted-chemical-list-by-category.pdf", "http://thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(16)30275-3/fulltext&quot;", "https://www.instagram.com/yahoostylebeauty/", "https://twitter.com/yahoostyle&quot;", "https://twitter.com/yahoobeauty&quot;", "http://thelancet.com/journals/landia/article/PIIS2213-8587(16)30275-3/fulltext", "https://cvshealth.com/sites/default/files/cvs-health-restricted-chemical-list-by-category.pdf&quot;"], "title": "CVS Says No More to Beauty Products With Toxic Chemicals", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "04/20/2017 01:03 pm ET | Updated 6 hours ago Jeff Sessions' Marijuana Policy Is Straight Out Of 'Reefer Madness' Tell your children.

He\u2019s still taking his pot policy straight from \u201cReefer Madness,\u201d the classically awful 1936 \u201ceducational\u201d film about marijuana addiction. \nThat film shows people who succumb to the dreaded wacky tobacky become criminally insane, promiscuous and \u2015 worst of all \u2015 fans of that devil music known as \u201cragtime.\u201d \nSessions is a real buzzkill, if you catch our drift (and our subtle weed pun). \nAlthough there are no recorded instances of anyone dying from a fatal dose of marijuana alone, some people like Sessions prefer propaganda to facts. \nIf that\u2019s what turns you on, take a big hit of the film that pretty much created the concept of \u201calternative facts.\u201d \nHappy 420 (even you, Jeff Sessions).

That\u2019s because the young actor will also be starring in Pilgrimage , where he\u2019s playing part of a group of 13th-century monks tasked with transporting an ancient relic across the Irish landscape. Ahead of that film\u2019s upcoming theatrical debut at this year\u2019s Tribeca Film Festival , we now have its first trailer above.\nOn the Irish coast in A.D. 1209, Holland and his fellow monks \u2014 including Richard Armitage\u2019s leader and Jon Bernthal\u2019s mute \u2014 set out on a quest to bring a legendary artifact with biblical origins to Rome, where they believe it will be safe from those who seek to wield its power. Their journey quickly turns into a perilous one, with all manner of military men and scoundrels attempting to snatch their cargo.\nA gritty, medieval thriller, Pilgrimage will aim to provide Holland with a headlining turn far removed from his upcoming Marvel heroics when it debuts this Sunday at Tribeca in New York.

By Taylor Pittman \nIn an Instagram post, a mom of twins cleared up a misconception about stay-at-home mothers. \nAnna Strode is known for her fitness videos that show her kids playing around her while she works out, which she posts on her Instagram page Bubs2Bikinis . On April 7, she wrote a post in response to a comment she\u2019d received from someone who implied that because Strode stays at home with her kids, she doesn\u2019t work. \nStrode, who has 23-month-old twins and is pregnant and due in June, felt motivated by the comment to explain what being a stay-at-home mom really means. A post shared by Anna Strode (@bubs2bikinis) on Apr 7, 2017 at 2:54am PDT \nIn her post, Strode wrote that she spends her days \u201cchanging shitty nappies,\u201d \u201cmaking food that gets thrown on the floor before it\u2019s even tasted\u201d and \u201cattempting to teach two little humans to share instead of bite, pull hair, scratch or push each other,\u201d among many other things. She also noted for anyone who thinks she spends all day working out that she tries to squeeze in a 20 to 30-minute workout every day, and even that is frequently interrupted by her kids. \nAs of Thursday, Strode\u2019s post has been liked more than 5,000 times. She\u2019s also received more than 1,000 comments, many of which are from Instagram users applauding Strode for her honesty. \nStrode told The Huffington Post that the feedback on her page is positive most of the time, but that she also receives comments from people who shame her for working out instead of playing with her kids. \n\u201cSome people say that me working out means I\u2019m not focusing on my children despite the fact my whole workout revolves around and includes them and is actually their favorite part of the day,\u201d she said. \nWhen asked whether she had anything she wanted to say to fellow stay-at-home moms, Strode said she wanted them to know they\u2019re not alone. \n\u201cIt can be demanding, isolating and damn hard work, but know what you are doing is incredible,\u201d she said. \u201cBe proud of just getting through each day!\u201d \nStrode also told HuffPost that all moms are \u201cheroes,\u201d no matter what their work entails. \n\u201cWe all have different circumstances \u2015 stay-at-home mums, work-out-of-the-home mums,\u201d she said. \u201cNo matter what you do or how you do it, every mum that is doing what is best for them and their family is a hero in my eyes.\u201d \nThe HuffPost Parents newsletter, So You Want To Raise A Feminist, offers the latest stories and news in progressive parenting.

But we\u2019re still not 100 percent convinced. \nWe\u2019ll just have to continue watching the final season to find out!

The book\u2019s authors, Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, said they drew that depiction after interviews with over 100 sources inside and outside the campaign.\n\u201cHillary\u2019s campaign was so spirit-crushing,\u201d they wrote in the book\u2019s foreword, \u201cthat her aides eventually shorthanded the feeling of impending doom with a simple mantra: We\u2019re not allowed to have nice things.\u201d\nOn Wednesday, Christina Reynolds, the campaign\u2019s deputy communications director, published a Medium post titled \u201c\u2018Shattered\u2019 or Contorted? What a New Book Gets Wrong About the Clinton Campaign,\u201d attempting to debunk the narrative of discord.\n\u201cI wanted to speak out because after spending most of the campaign watching some people question the enthusiasm and our supporters, it\u2019s hard to read a depiction of the campaign that paints a dedicated, cohesive team as mercenaries with questionable motives who lacked a loyalty to a candidate described as \u2018imperial\u2019 and removed from the campaign,\u201d Reynolds wrote.\nInspired by Reynolds\u2019 essay, more staffers and people otherwise affiliated with the campaign followed suit on Twitter, sharing lighthearted behind-the-scenes photos from the trail, often punctuated with sarcastic comments.\nThe photos included scenes of campaign stops, debate prep and office outings.\nHRC's Debate Team cracking up watching SNL\u2026 pic.twitter.com/VDF4dUnM68\n\u2014 Philippe Reines (@PhilippeReines) April 20, 2017\nNo idea what's happening here, but I've always wanted to share this beaut of HRC and @NickMerrill that captures her really special campaign. pic.twitter.com/bq8capPYpB\n\u2014 Philippe Reines (@PhilippeReines) April 20, 2017\nNo idea who the guy in the middle is \u2013 but he didn't need to stand on a chair.\nAnd nobody even noticed we forgot to include the candidate! pic.twitter.com/Kb3zf3EF2s\n\u2014 Philippe Reines (@PhilippeReines) April 20, 2017\nGame 7 of the World Series.

YELIM LEE via Getty Images Marion Kelly stole the show at her family's press conference following their viral BBC appearance. \nIn March, political science professor Robert Kelly and his family became international sensations, thanks to a viral BBC segment during which Kelly\u2019s adorable children interrupted his video interview. In the media frenzy that followed, the world fell in love with his kids , 4-year-old Marion and 8-month-old James. \nNow, the Kelly kids are getting their very own show . \nOn April 17, Hans House Productions released the first episode of \u201cThe Adventures of Mina and Jack\u201d \u2015 an animated YouTube series based on Marion and James. The show follows Mina and Jack \u2015 \u201ca mischievous duo who can\u2019t help but get into trouble ... and on the news.\u201d \nIn the first episode of the show, Mina and Jack join their father, who works for the U.N. (or \u201cthe un\u201d as Mina calls it), on a trip to North Africa to catch a gold thief. The three-minute video is perfect for anyone looking for more of the spunky girl, adorable baby, frantic mom and nervous father. \nIn some ways, a show inspired by Marion Kelly seems only natural. In the midst of the family\u2019s moment of fame, Twitter users couldn\u2019t get enough of the pink-bespectacled troublemaker. \nOne viral tweet called for Marion to form a mystery-solving team with Daliyah Marie Arana , the 4-year-old girl who got to be \u201clibrarian for the day\u201d at the Library of Congress after reading more than 1,000 books.

But the situation is rough for businesses, foreign and domestic, as well. \nAdvertisement   Political tensions, corruption, high crime rates, a restrictive investment law and interruptions of electric service have made doing business in Venezuela akin to running an obstacle course en route to bankruptcy. Especially burdensome have been harsh currency restrictions and repeated devaluations of the bol\u00edvar, the local currency, which have limited imports of vital machine parts and goods, while shrinking the value in dollars of company revenues. Much if not most business is done with the government and state-owned companies, and invoices can go unpaid for months on end. The government has expropriated more than 1,400 private businesses since 1998, according to the State Department. \u201cNowadays, there is no country in Latin America more difficult for a company to operate in,\u201d said Luis Giusti, a former chief executive of Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, the national oil company, who also worked for Shell Corp. of Venezuela. \u201cThere is uncertainty for the future of the economy, and companies have long periods to wait for cash.\u201d Coca-Cola, long one of the most successful companies in Latin America, suspended production in Venezuela last summer because of a scarcity of sugar in a country that once was one of the prime producers in the region. Bridgestone, Clorox, Ford Motor, General Mills, Kimberly Clark and Procter & Gamble have all left Venezuela or scaled back production sharply in the country amid political hostility and a general shortage of necessary raw materials in recent years. In the economy\u2019s most vital sector, oil production, the international companies that remain are barely hanging on. Scores of international and domestic oil service companies have been expropriated since President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who was elected in 1998, came to power. Under Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, the government took a majority stake in four giant oil projects in 2007, prompting Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips to leave the country. Chevron has chosen to stay as a minority partner to PDVSA. Mr. Ch\u00e1vez, who died in 2013 , also seized a major gas injection project run by Williams Companies of Tulsa, Oklahoma, and seized 11 rigs from Helmerich & Payne, another major service company based in Oklahoma. Life under Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s successor, Mr. Maduro, has been no better, especially since oil prices plunged in late 2014 . Several international service companies are keeping staff members, offices and equipment, including rigs, in the country despite a lack of payments from PDVSA in hopes that Venezuela will return to its traditional place as South America\u2019s leading oil producer. \nAdvertisement   But Baker Hughes, Halliburton, Schlumberger and Weatherford have all reduced their activities in the country. PDVSA has tried to appease the service companies by paying old bills with bonds and promissory notes. Schlumberger announced last year that it would reduce its presence in Venezuela because PDVSA was $1.2 billion in arrears. Halliburton was owed $756 million as of last spring, according to Oilprice.com , a trade publication. Photo A Chevrolet dealership in Caracas in 2015. The company\u2019s parent, General Motors, said the Venezuelan government had \u201cillegally\u201d seized the its plant in the country. Credit Carlos Garcia Rawlins/Reuters Venezuelan oil executives said that PDVSA\u2019s partners were now making marginal profits or losing money outright. These executives said that when the price of oil was over $100 a barrel, money could still be made despite the mismanagement of PDVSA and the revolving door of state-run company officials they had to work with. But now taxes and royalties are killing profits, and making long-term investment unviable. \u201cEverybody is waiting for a change of government, and hopefully they will recoup some of their accounts payable due to them,\u201d said Jorge R. Pi\u00f1on, former president of Amoco Oil in Latin America. \u201cThey cannot afford to leave because they are deeply invested in the country. They don\u2019t want to pack up and then have to repack their boxes and go back to Caracas.\u201d The worsening political and economic situation has left many foreign companies debating whether to stay or to go.

The researchers found that instances of sexual violence and harassment were so pervasive that 1 in 6 of the teen girls surveyed said they had been harassed since Election Day . \nThe report, titled \u201c Let Her Learn: Stopping School Pushout ,\u201d was conducted in partnership with Lake Research Partners to pinpoint the reasons why girls drop out of school. Researchers surveyed 1,003 teen girls between the ages of 14 to 18 from across the United States this past January. \nAccording to the report, 1 in 5 girls between 14 and 18 years old (21 percent) reported being sexually assaulted \u2015 defined by NWLC as \u201cthey had been kissed or touched without their consent.\u201d \nGirls of color and LGBTQ girls experience sexual assault and harassment at higher than average rates. \nTwenty-four percent of Latina girls reported experiencing unwanted kissing or touching. Twenty-three percent of Native American girls, and 22 percent of black girls reported experiencing sexual assault. LGBTQ girls experienced the highest incidences of sexual assault, with 38 percent reporting they had been kissed or touched without their consent. \nThe researchers found that 6 percent of all girls surveyed said they had been raped. But, again, those numbers were higher for LGBTQ girls and girls of color: 15 percent of LGBTQ girls, 11 percent of Native American girls, 9 percent of black girls, and 7 percent of Latina girls reported being forced to have sex when they did not want to. National Womens Law Center Thirty percent of teenage girls experience their \"first rape\" at 17 years old. \nThese statistics take on new weight given that the president of the United States is an accused sexual predator . \nAccording to the survey, more than 1 in 6 teenage girls (or 17 percent) reported that they had experienced harassment since the 2016 presidential election. \nMany advocates worried that there would be an uptick in violence against women when President Donald Trump took office. Directly after the election, many incidences of sexism and harassment happened, along with an increase in hate crimes . \nPresident Trump has been accused of sexually assaulting more than a dozen women , and has publicly defended other men who have been accused of sexual harassment and assault, like Roger Ailes and the recently-ousted Bill O\u2019Reilly . \n\u201cMy concern is based on not just what [President Trump\u2019s] behavior has been, because he is an individual, but what he can do to influence other men\u2019s behaviors and other women\u2019s perceptions of their value,\u201d Rita Smith, the former executive director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, told The Huffington Post in November . \u201cEven just the election itself had an impact on how men treated and talked about women.\u201d \nNeena Chaudhry, NWLC Director of Education, explained in a press release that this data should \u201csound an urgent alarm\u201d for politicians and educators across the country. \n\u201cThe trauma that girls experience affects not only their mental and physical health but also their ability to concentrate, feel safe, and stay and do well in school,\u201d Chaudhry wrote. \u201cWe need targeted policies to help these groups of girls stay and thrive in school, and we owe them no less.\u201d \nHead over to the National Women\u2019s Law Center to read the full report, which also explores other obstacles young girls face including homelessness, unplanned pregnancy and racism. \nCORRECTION : This entry has been updated to clarify that 1 in 6 teen girls reported being harassed, which includes both sexual harassment and non-sexual harassment, since Election Day.

Catherine Miller Rongitsch Cat Miller Rongitsch says meeting her step-daughter Maddy opened her eyes to accessibility issues. \nGetting a haircut can be a challenging experience for any child, but especially for a child with disabilities. That\u2019s why a Minnesota mom and hair stylist is trying to open an accessible salon specifically for kids with cognitive and physical differences in St. Paul. \n\u201cAs a beauty professional with daughters that have challenges, I know that there are aspects of a salon that can create obstacles for some individuals to have a positive experience. Will the building be accessible? Will there be loud music? Chemical smells? What if I need a break? How will the staff react to my differences? Getting a bad haircut can be low on the list of concerns,\u201dCat Miller Rongitsch wrote on the GoFundMe page she posted to raise money for the salon. \nRongitsch has a 9-year-old step-daughter named Maddy, who is paraplegic from spina bifida and uses a wheelchair, and a second daughter, 3-year-old Betty, who has cognitive disabilities. At the last salon she worked at, the front door wasn\u2019t accessible and Maddy had to use a side entrance. Catherine Miller Rongitsch At the last salon Rongitsch worked at, the front door wasn\u2019t accessible for her daughter Maddy. \nOver the years, the stylist has also made home visits to do haircuts for kids with autism who have difficulty in a salon environment. \n\u201cThere\u2019s so much anxiety and fear for the whole family going to the salon. It\u2019s a big deal, so having me come in helps alleviate some of that. There should be a place for that,\u201d she told The Huffington Post. \nRongitsch\u2019s salon will have accessible entrances and wide aisles, a quiet atmosphere aided by silent blow dryers and textured flooring for people with visual impairment. The salon will also offer weighted blankets and fidget toys. She hopes to create a \u201csafe space\u201d for all people with disabilities to get \u201cservices with dignity.\u201d \nRecalling a photo that went viral in 2015 of a barber lying on the floor to cut the hair of a boy with autism , she says: \u201cIt was good to see that, but at the same time it made me sad that this family was so overwhelmed by the care that this stylist took with their little boy that it went viral. It should be the standard and it\u2019s a standard I want to create.\u201d \nSo far, the reception has been good. Rongitsch says she has been overwhelmed with responses from families who can\u2019t wait to visit the salon when it is opened. As of Thursday morning, she had raised $3,895 of her $25,000 goal. \n\u201cThere are so many people reaching out to me and saying \u2018Thank you\u2019 and that they\u2019re so glad there will finally be a place for their family to go. There\u2019s a lot of excitement and encouragement,\u201d she says.

Shapiro. Ms. Lee would be the first Asian-American woman to have a play produced on Broadway. \u201cOn the one hand, that\u2019s great, but it\u2019s also like, \u2018Oh, why hasn\u2019t there been another Asian-American female on Broadway?\u2019\u201d Ms. Lee said. But the most potentially game-changing aspect of the Second Stage plan is its effort to create a pipeline to Broadway for living American writers. Other nonprofits routinely commission plays by many of the same people, and only sometimes those works transfer to Broadway. The Second Stage initiative is unusual in creating an explicit pathway to Broadway, with a preliminary production elsewhere and then, if all goes well, a transfer to the Helen Hayes. The theater has not only underwritten work from nine well-regarded writers (six of whom have previously worked on Broadway), but it has negotiated partnerships with three other entities to jointly commission and help develop those works before Broadway. The most significant partnership is with Center Theater Group , one of the largest nonprofit theaters in the country, which has commissioned, with Second Stage, six of the writers, including Ms. Nottage and another Pulitzer winner, Paula Vogel (\u201cIndecent\u201d); the Tony winner Lisa Kron (\u201cFun Home\u201d); as well as Jon Robin Baitz (\u201cOther Desert Cities\u201d), Will Eno (\u201cThe Realistic Joneses\u201d) and Ms. Lee. All but Ms. Lee have had work on Broadway, Ms. Nottage and Ms. Vogel only this year, after long careers. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Center Theater Group also announced Thursday separate partnerships with the Goodman Theater in Chicago, and the National and Royal Court theaters in London, to commission new works that would have multiple productions. \u201cI will get a wider variety and a greater quality and quantity of good plays for my audience,\u201d said Michael Ritchie, the artistic director of the Los Angeles theater. Second Stage said it has also agreed to commission with True Colors Theater (founded by the director Kenny Leon) new Broadway-bound works by the playwrights Lydia R. Diamond (\u201cStick Fly\u201d) and Dominique Morrisseau (\u201cSkeleton Crew\u201d), and with Williamstown Theater Festival a new play by Bess Wohl (\u201cSmall Mouth Sounds\u201d). Second Stage also announced Thursday that it would present a production of \u201cMary Page Marlowe,\u201d by Tracy Letts, in its existing Off Broadway theater next June. The announcement, made from the stage of the Helen Hayes by theater officials and playwrights in hard hats, had a bit of unanticipated drama: During the news conference, a construction worker\u2019s tape measure dropped from the overhead fly space, whizzing by the playwrights in hard hats and crashing to the floor with an alarming thwack.

Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Fox News and O\u2019Reilly had paid five women who had accused him of inappropriate behavior over $13 million in settlements, leading to an exodus of more than 50 advertisers from his top-rated primetime show.\nRelated: Keith Olbermann\u2019s advice to Bill O\u2019Reilly: \u2018Fess Up\u2019\nO\u2019Reilly called the claims that resulted in his departure from Fox News \u201cunfounded.\u201d\n\u201cIt is tremendously disheartening that we part ways due to completely unfounded claims,\u201d he said in a statement . \u201cBut that is the unfortunate reality many of us in the public eye must live with today.\u201d\nIn a memo to 21st Century Fox staff explaining O\u2019Reilly\u2019s exit, owners Rupert, James and Lachlan Murdoch said they wanted \u201cto underscore our consistent commitment to fostering a work environment built on the values of trust and respect.\u201d\nThe drumbeat of accusations that led to O\u2019Reilly\u2019s ouster began to gather steam last summer, when former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson filed a sexual harassment suit against former Fox News chairman and CEO Roger Ailes. Carlson alleged she had been fired by Ailes after refusing to have sex with him.\nAiles later resigned after an internal investigation turned up harassment claims from more women, including former Fox News star Megyn Kelly.\nCarlson marked O\u2019Reilly\u2019s departure Wednesday in a tweet calling on Congress to pass legislation helping victims of workplace harassment.\n\u201cThe only way to end harassment is to shine a light on it,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAsk Congress to pass the Fairness in Arbitration Act.

No more silencing women! ????\n\u2014 Gretchen Carlson (@GretchenCarlson) April 19, 2017\nOn CNN, former Fox News regulars spoke about their own experiences with O\u2019Reilly, Ailes and the allegedly toxic culture that permeated their work environment.\nKirsten Powers, a USA Today columnist and CNN contributor, recalled an incident in which O\u2019Reilly thanked her and Margaret Hoover, who is also now with CNN, for their \u201cblondness\u201d on air.\n\u201cSo I went to his executive producer and I said, \u2018He needs to apologize, and he needs to never do that again or I\u2019m not doing his show anymore,\u2019\u201d Powers said. \u201cAnd I was told basically, \u2018Well, you know Bill, there\u2019s nothing we can do about it. He\u2019s a throwback. He\u2019s kind of an Archie Bunker.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cAnd I said, \u2018Well, if you mean he\u2019s a Neanderthal, then we\u2019re on the same page. He can never do that again. I\u2019m a political analyst here,\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201c[The executive producer] went to Bill, came back and said, \u2018No, he\u2019s not going to apologize.\u2019\u201d\nPowers said she complained to Ailes, who she said told her, \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do. It\u2019s Bill. He\u2019s a jerk. Nobody likes him.\u201d\n\u201cYou know Bill. He likes to put up dirty pictures and ask girls to talk about them,\u201d Ailes said, according to Powers.\n\u201cThis was the culture,\u201d Powers said. \u201cBill was, you know, just too big, and so there was nothing you could do about it.\u201d\nHoover, a Republican strategist, said such an experience was \u201cfrankly pretty common at Fox News.\u201d\n\u201cIt makes you feel like you\u2019re there as a blond backdrop for O\u2019Reilly\u2019s opinions and not as a political analyst or a commentator,\u201d Hoover said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d on Thursday. \u201cThere were moments that were very uncomfortable with him, and I had to navigate a minefield \u2026 to make sure I was never in a situation where I was made vulnerable.\u201d\n\u201cNew Day\u201d co-host Alisyn Camerota, who also used to work at Fox News, described feeling helpless there .\n\u201cThere was a feeling, when I was there, that Roger was the boss,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was Roger Ailes\u2019 fiefdom. He was the king. There was no higher authority that you could ever go to, and there was harassment. And I tried, in my own way, to raise the flag and to talk to people about it. I went to my superiors to talk to them about it. And there was certainly a feeling of, \u2018This is Roger. What are you going to do? Who are you going to go to?\u2019\u201d\nShe dismissed O\u2019Reilly\u2019s previous defense that there was a hotline women who felt harassed could call \u2014 yet no one called to complain about him.\n\u201cThere was no hotline,\u201d she said.\nCamerota predicted there will be more workplace harassment allegations to come.\n\u201cLook, I was there for a long time, as you all know, and I know a lot about the culture,\u201d Camerota said, \u201cAnd [talking to] my friends there, there\u2019s a feeling that there\u2019s more to come.

According to NESN Patriots beat reporter Doug Kyed , 34 Patriots players had opted out of attending the ceremony .\nThe tweet was reminiscent of the now famous photos comparing inauguration crowd sizes for Obama and Trump. Those photos had sent the White House into a fury, with press secretary Sean Spicer falsely claiming that his boss had achieved the largest crowd size in inauguration history.\nBut the Times fumbled the tweet about the Patriots visit and the football team\u2019s official Twitter emerged from the backfield to correct them.\nThese photos lack context.

Hernandez did not leave behind any suicide note, but he did reportedly write the words \"John 3:16\" on his forehead before his death. The widely known Bible verse says, \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\" The Washington Post reported that a Bible found in his cell was reportedly opened to that page.\nTrending: Mother-of-four forced to leave her children after deportation to Mexico\nWBZ-TV, the CBS affiliate in Boston, reported Hernandez was also found with markings on both his hands and feet. The markings drawn on his body were done with a \"blood red\" marker, Boston's Fox25 reported. Some are speculating that the former New England Patriots player was attempting to draw stigmata markings on his body before allegedly committing suicide.\nAuthorities are conducting an investigation into the American football player's death. According to WBZ-TV, investigators believe 27-year-old Hernandez may have smoked a synthetic marijuana known as K2 hours before his death.\nDon't miss: Inside America's deadly opioid crisis: 'It feels like a horror movie'\nAuthorities claim that Hernandez hanged himself in his single cell with a bed sheet. He reportedly used various things to block his cell door before he was found at approximately 3.05am EST (8.05am GMT). Officers at Souza-Baranowski Correction Center in Shirley tried to save Hernandez's life and took him to UMass-Memorial Health Alliance Hospital in Leominster where he was pronounced dead by a physician at 4.07am.\nHernandez's former agent and lawyer maintain that there was no way the ex-NFL player would have committed suicide because he was not suicidal. \"The family and legal team is shocked and surprised at the news of Aaron's death,\" defence lawyer Jose Baez said in a statement to the Boston Herald.\nMost popular: Trump's son plays football in full Arsenal gear at White House\n\"There were no conversations or correspondence from Aaron to his family or legal team that would have indicated anything like this was possible. Aaron was looking forward to an opportunity for a second chance to prove his innocence,\" Baez said. \"Those who love and care about him are heartbroken and determined to find the truth surrounding his untimely death. We request that authorities conduct a transparent and thorough investigation.\"\nBaez also said his law firm would conduct its own probe on Hernandez's death.\nBrian Murphy, Hernandez's former agent, also claimed there was \"no chance\" the former athlete committed suicide. \"Absolutely no chance he took his own life. Chico was not a saint, but my family and I loved him and he would never take his own life,\" Murphy tweeted.\nOn Friday (14 April), a Boston jury found Hernandez not guilty of the 2012 deaths of two men, Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado. Hernandez was serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2015 of the 2013 death of semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd.\nAccording to the Boston Globe, Hernandez may have died an innocent man in the state of Massachusetts due to an archaic legal principle known as \"abatement ab initio\". Hernandez was appealing his conviction and because he died before exhausting his legal appeals, his case would revert to its status at the beginning.\nHernandez's appellate attorney, John M Thompson, told the Globe he would file to vacate the conviction. That move could be challenged by the Bristol County District Attorney Thomas M Quinn III's office or the Lloyd family.\nYou may be interested in:\n'The Devil controlled me' says old man jailed after

Do Not Punch the Dolphins Continue reading the main story Photo Tourists with a pink dolphin in the Amazon River in Brazil. Credit Flavio Varricchio/Brazil Photos, via LightRocket, via Getty Images MANAUS, Brazil \u2014 The \u201cencontro das \u00e1guas\u201d (meeting of waters) between the dark Negro River and the light-brown Solim\u00f5es River is impressive. No wonder it\u2019s one of the main tourist attractions near the city of Manaus, capital of the state of Amazonas. For several miles, the two gigantic rivers flow side by side without mixing because of their difference in water composition, flow rate and density. (You can feel the variation of temperature by putting your hand in the water as the boat crosses the visually distinct line.) When the Negro and the Solim\u00f5es finally merge, they form the Amazon, the world\u2019s largest river by discharge of water and one of the longest. When I recently went on a boat tour in the Janauari Ecological Reserve, near the meeting of waters, the boatman asked if I would also like to visit a family of ribeirinhos (riverside dwellers) who have a caiman, a sloth and a snake. \u201cYou can take selfies with the animals, and later give them some gratification,\u201d he told me, euphemistically suggesting tips for the people who keep the animals. I vociferously declined. We resumed our navigation on the small motorboat through cool, peaceful igarap\u00e9s (forest streams) leading to dazzling igap\u00f3s (swampy, flooded forests). It seemed as if a dam had ruptured somewhere and the place was about to be submerged. Trees as high as buildings were half drowned by the river. The boatman became less talkative, as if I\u2019d offended him by refusing his last offer. I enjoyed the scenery; there was no need to hug illegally domesticated sloths. Brazil still has a long way to go in the field of ecotourism. While in some places, as on the island of Fernando de Noronha, in the northeast, the rules concerning wildlife preservation are strict, in others there is less attention to long-term conservation and the ecological and social impact of tourism, often leading to the pure and simple exploitation of animals, as well as local people and their cultures.

Privacy Policy One of the most profitable tourist activities in the Amazon is swimming alongside pink dolphins or feeding them from a flutuante , a private floating deck, often situated within a national park. Tourists regularly ride, restrain and harass the dolphins. Some even lift them out of the water for photographs. (Sometimes this is done with the encouragement of a tour guide.) There are accounts of people being accidentally bitten, and on one occasion, a man retaliated by punching the dolphin. Continue reading the main story A few years ago, a commission of federal agencies and research institutes issued local guidelines for the activity \u2014 including the amount of food to be offered and the requirement that only tour guides could feed the dolphins \u2014 but few people adhere to them. According to the owner of one flutuante, tourists must only avoid touching the dolphin\u2019s blowhole. (Please!) \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story There\u2019s no federal legislation prohibiting feeding and touching the dolphins. As a result, their behavior has already changed: Many now survive on the frozen fish provided by tourism groups. They\u2019re also conditioned to stay close to the flutuantes and to humans. According to researchers, aggression is now common among the dolphins. Another popular activity in the Brazilian Amazon is caiman-spotting. In the evening, groups of people cruise the riverbanks, seeking out the huge nocturnal lizards that resemble crocodiles. It wouldn\u2019t be disruptive if so many guides didn\u2019t make a point of jumping in the water to grab the caimans and hold them up for photos. Amazon tour operators also offer recreational fishing of piranha, the omnivorous fish with sharp teeth and a ferocious reputation, and fake fishing of pirarucu , an ancient, giant fish that is at risk of extinction. The latter takes place in enclosed water tanks. In some ways, it\u2019s better because the pirarucus aren\u2019t injured by hooks, only mildly harassed by tourists trying to lift them out of the water. Photo Alter do Chao has grown in popularity with Brazilian and foreign tourists in recent years, earning itself the nickname the \u201cCaribbean of the Amazon,\u201d leading some to worry about over development, and its environmental impact on the fragile ecosystem. Credit Bryan Denton for The New York Times All of these activities take advantage of a lack of clear laws governing ecotourism and the use of natural resources. Tour operators promote packages by using questionable environmentalist phrases. One advertises \u201cecological fishing\u201d; another promises to have the federal environmental agency\u2019s authorization to take tourists swimming with dolphins. That\u2019s enough for most people visiting the Amazon \u2014 even if it\u2019s not true. The local people who keep wild animals as pets to lure tourists often claim that they release the animals at night and recapture them in the morning. Animals are not the only ones being abused. Another popular activity in Manaus is a visit to an indigenous community formed by five ethnic groups (Dessana, Tukana, Tuyuca, Wanana and Tatuia), which some tour operators deceitfully describe as a \u201ctribe.\u201d Since the beginning of the last century, the indigenous people, who are perhaps Brazil\u2019s most marginalized and impoverished population, have migrated (or been expelled) from their original lands. (And I\u2019m talking only about the small remnant left after the genocides that started with the arrival of the Portuguese.) They stage traditional music and dance performances for the guests of expensive jungle lodges. Indigenous people are often forced by their employers to meet tourists\u2019 stereotypes: the romantic, noble savage with slightly frightening rituals and no refrigerator. But that\u2019s not the worst part. Indigenous people didn\u2019t know that some of their bosses have traditional practices of their own: For five years, 34 Tariano people worked for a jungle lodge in exchange for only leftover food and a collective paycheck of $30 per performance. Others are not even paid and instead rely on selling handicrafts and jewelry to the visitors. There is no industry-standard agreement on the fair share of revenues for indigenous groups, and again, no federal regulation. It seems nothing will change until indigenous people themselves have the means to control all aspects of the experience they offer to tourists \u2014 and also reap the profits. On the other hand, many jungle lodges and tour operators are becoming more aware of these issues. Environmentally conscious tourists are also pushing for changes. The sustainable Uakari Lodge in the Mamirau\u00e1 Reserve, for example, is run by members of the local community. So maybe there is some progress. In another jungle lodge called Anavilhanas, better attuned to an environmental conscience, I\u2019ve enjoyed the most jaw-dropping tour of my trip: a simple kayak expedition through igarap\u00e9s and igap\u00f3s, stopping here and there to watch birds, monkeys and spiders at a distance.

For here is some stupid-idea manna from stupid-idea heaven: Hot take du jour: @POTUS should \"do a deal\" with Justice Ginsburg to retire and get Merrick Garland on #SCOTUS . https://t.co/Wg4D5cpR5I \u2014 Cristian Far\u00edas \ud83d\udcab (@cristianafarias) April 18, 2017 \nHa, what now? President Donald Trump should \u201cdo a deal\u201d with Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg that would see her vacate her Supreme Court seat for a swap-a-doo with Merrick Garland? This is great. Surprisingly, this notion was not dreamed up by noted twin-engine bad idea machine Pat Caddell and Doug Schoen, though you could be forgiven for thinking so . No, this is a plan hatched by Newsmax CEO and Trump confidant Chris Ruddy, and written up by Business Insider\u2019s Allan Smith. It goes a little something like this : \n\u201cI think they made a big mistake by pulling the nuclear option,\u201d Ruddy said. \u201cI wrote about it. I said they should not have done it. I think that he still should pick Merrick Garland and do a deal. Ruth Bader Ginsburg wants to retire, and I think they should swap her out, give her an offer where they would put Merrick Garland on the Supreme Court.\u201d \n\u201cThey would remove a very liberal Democrat with a moderate, consensus Democrat, who I think Garland is,\u201d Ruddy added. \u201cAnd I think it would be a huge move and a sign for Trump that he\u2019s willing to break through the political ice.\u201d \nSo, the good news here is that Chris Ruddy is pretty close to the president, and if he can just manage to get this bee into Trump\u2019s bonnet, it might consume a chunk of time that Trump would otherwise spend doing anything else. That would be a good enough outcome. But that\u2019s about as far as this particular notion would ever go. You see, right off the bat, I can imagine some pretty significant impediments to this \u201cdeal.\u201d \nLet\u2019s begin with the notion that \u201cRuth Bader Ginsburg wants to retire.\u201d Does she? Just about every year, someone asks Ginsburg if she wants to retire , and her answer is always a resounding \u201c Nah, son \u201d (paraphrase). The last time anyone checked in with Ginsburg on this, it was Politico in October 2016. On that occasion , she said that she\u2019d retire \u201cwhen it\u2019s time,\u201d and clarified that it\u2019d be \u201ctime\u201d when she \u201ccan\u2019t do the job full-steam.\u201d \nThere\u2019s been no indication that she\u2019s changed her mind on this, so God knows where Ruddy is getting this \u201cshe wants to retire\u201d stuff. Are you allowed to just pull strange assertions out of the air now and insist they\u2019re true? Because Chris Ruddy really wants to run the Mariinsky Ballet. Someone should \u201cdo a deal\u201d and bring their current artistic director, Valery Gergiev, to Newsmax. \nWow. I have to say, it felt pretty great to just make stuff up like that. And the good news is that my deal makes at least as much sense as the one Ruddy himself has proposed. \nI\u2019m having a hard time imagining how this deal would be brokered, or why Ginsburg would go along with it. By all accounts, she doesn\u2019t seem to like Trump, and wouldn\u2019t be inclined to even participate in this plan. What\u2019s more, allowing herself to be replaced by Merrick Garland would be a singularly silly way for Ginsburg to cap off a legacy that\u2019s been widely celebrated of late. Where\u2019s the upside for Ginsburg? The thing about \u201cdeals\u201d is that all parties involved are supposed to get some kind of benefit. \nBut, OK, let\u2019s say that Ginsburg takes leave of her senses and agrees to this. Then we\u2019d just have the thorny little problem that this is not how the process of replacing a Supreme Court Justice works. Remember how there\u2019s this thing called \u201cthe Senate\u201d and they just nuked the judicial filibuster, making it possible to confirm anyone to the Supreme Court with a simple majority? Well, this newly empowered Senate, which is run by the Republican Party, is not going to agree to a plan in which Merrick Garland joins the court. \nNow, can I be so certain about that? Well, it\u2019s true that all I have to go on is the fact that those same Republicans just spent a year of their lives keeping Garland off the Supreme Court \u2015 an obscure gesture that received very little attention, to be sure \u2015 but I just have this funny feeling they might prefer to fill any potential court vacancy with a really conservative justice, as opposed to a moderately liberal one. \nBut who knows? In a world where Ruth Bader Ginsburg is dealmaking to her historical detriment with a president she opposes, maybe everyone\u2019s gone nuts to an equal degree. Maybe we swap out Justice Kennedy with a kitten wearing a top hat? In this weird world, I suppose anything is possible. I look forward to reading Justice Kitten With A Top Hat\u2019s dissents.

By Noah Michelson \nSex Heroes is an ongoing HuffPost Q&A series by Voices Editorial Director Noah Michelson that explores the lives and experiences of individuals who are challenging, and thereby changing, mainstream culture\u2019s understanding of sex and sexuality. \nIn our modern age of online dating and internet hook ups, dick pics, for better or for worse, have become a kind of digital currency \u2015 especially for gay men. Hop on Grindr or Scruff or any other web app designed to connect men looking for love \u2015 or just someone to get off with \u2015 and it won\u2019t be long before you\u2019re asked to show exactly what you\u2019re packing. \nFor some, sharing explicit images isn\u2019t a big deal. But for those who are worried about privacy and want to avoid having their nether bits distributed to anyone \u2015 or everyone \u2015 on the internet, dick pics have been seen as a total no-go. \nGyorgy Szucs, the 28-year-old gay CEO and founder of design and code company Creative Robot, wants to help eradicate dick pic stigma while promoting sex and body positivity and what he refers to as \u201ckinkiness.\u201d He\u2019s developed a new app, called Dick Code , that lets users choose from a number of illustrations that most closely match their genitals and then generates a \u201ccode\u201d that they can send to whomever they choose without fearing that move might eventually come back to haunt them. Via Dick Code Dick Code users are asked to select the penis that most closely matches their own. \nDick Code asks each user to select from a variety of physical penis characteristics \u2015 from size and girth to hairiness and curvature \u2015 in order to create an intimate profile of their member that is as representative as possible. Dick Codes also offers additional information that a dick pic can\u2019t, like the trajectory and pattern of the individual\u2019s ejaculate. \n\u201cI started by drawing many dicks as a practice,\u201d Szucs told me in an email. \u201cFirst I started with the obvious categories, like size and circumference and then I went on to the \u2018dirty\u2019 stuff and added everything that my mind could think of absolutely shamelessly.\u201d \nSzucs, who is originally from Hungary but currently resides in Santiago, Chile, also shared with me where the inspiration for Dick Code originally came from, his thoughts on the politics of dick pics (especially involving straight men sending unwanted images to women), his upcoming plans for Vagina Code and Sex Code apps and more. \nThe Huffington Post: Where did the idea for Dick Code come from? Was there a specific \u201ca ha!\u201d moment of inspiration? Gyorgy Szucs: I received a picture from a friend with drawn penises where you could choose the right one for you. I felt it was incomplete and too complicated to communicate the result. I immediately thought it could be a great web app, especially if I put my kinkiness in it as well. via Dick Code Dick Code asks users to choose the trajectory of ejaculate that most closely matches their own. \nDo you intend for people to really use it when communicating with others online? Or is it more of an art or conversation piece? I wanted a simple, handy tool that enables people to communicate more about their sexual features. I focused on the parts we tend to be shy about, so I intentionally didn\u2019t give descriptions. I\u2019m a very rational person, so I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s an art piece \u2015 I just want to help people and bring out their kink. \nDick pics are controversial and can be problematic because they are often sent to people who don\u2019t want them \u2015 especially by straight men to straight women . What are your personal thoughts about the politics of dick pics? It depends. I believe if you receive a dick pic you didn\u2019t ask for, most likely that means the owner of it has an ugly face and/or personality. But if you\u2019re already in a conversation with someone online looking for a hookup, and passed the mental check, I see no problem in exchanging hot pics. Now you can exchange dick codes too. via Dick Code Dick Code asks users to choose the amount of pubic and testicle hair that most closely matches their own. \nDo you think that dick pics work differently among gay men versus non-gay people? How do you think women feel about this and do you think straight men would use Dick Code? Let me tell you \u2015 [by looking at Google analytics I learned that] 40 percent of the 1 million visitors I had in four days were women. I thought it would be a gay thing only, but I think now I\u2019ll have to interview straight women too to see what\u2019s going on. Based on the feedback so far, I believe that girls use it to describe their favorite dick. Straight guys don\u2019t really use it, in fact they are mostly disgusted by this, but maybe they will soon be asked by their next date to share their dick code. No escape. \nWhat has the response been? What are people saying? I\u2019m having such fun days. I\u2019m receiving like 50 messages a day about how ingenious the idea is, how easy it became for shy people to be more kinky. They are laughing a lot while still sharing features they never talked about before. And the most amazing part is that people who created and shared their dick code tell me how surprisingly positive the responses are. They believed that their dick was not impressive as it is not \u201cbig,\u201d but they had now come to the realization that people (women especially) are kinky deep inside and find certain aspects of a dick impressive, other than just the size. \nAnd of course, girls keep asking for the V[agina] Code. I\u2019m already working on that, I just need lots of help as I\u2019m not experienced in that area. Gygorgy Szucs Gyorgy Szucs, the 28-year-old gay CEO and founder of design and code company Creative Robot, who invited Dick Code \nAre there other \u201ccodes\u201d in the works and when will they roll out? Vagina Code and Sex Code. The latter will be basically about sex positions and games. Kinky games. I believe the V Code will come in the following few weeks, and the Sex Code after that. I\u2019ll update the Dick Code page with details. \nI\u2019m absolutely shocked by the fact how many women use the Dick Code. I think the V code will be fun for straight guys mostly, but I guess the Sex Code will turn into the next \u201c50 Shades of Grey.\u201d \nWhat do you ultimately want people to take away from this project? I believe it is a fun tool to bring out your kinkiness in a very safe way and share it with your partner. It\u2019s easy to tap innocent drawn images about dirty stuff. It is definitely not just a gay thing. People tell me and now I believe that I started something big, something that might reform online dating and the way we talk about sex. I\u2019ll keep adding ways to it. I hope that dating sites will realize the value and maybe add a field in people\u2019s profile for D, V and Sex Codes. \nYou can visit Dick Code here .

In the Jakarta outlet, for example, the company is working on a new uniform that will feature skorts (skirts with shorts underneath), higher necklines and thicker stockings. \u201cWe want to be culturally respectful,\u201d Neil Bailey, the president of Hooters Asia told news outlet Channel NewsAsia. \u201cWe sat down with members of the local governing boards and advisors of a mosque nearby. We showed them our website and said: \u2018This is who we are.

It also has a no-smoking rule and has no age restriction. \u201cHooters of America was worried [that modifications would dilute the brand] but we didn't have to take long to convince them,\" said Bailey. But whilst Hooters might have been able to convince their American counterparts, it might take a bit more convincing for people to come round to the idea of Hooters as a family restaurant.

Credit Lukas Coch/Australian Associated Press, via Reuters DARWIN, Australia \u2014 When Nhan Do heard that Australia planned to make it more difficult to become a citizen of the country he had called home for 25 years, he was overcome with confusion.\n\u201cI have to ask, Why do they keep making it harder?\u201d said Mr. Do, 41, who fled Vietnam with his family as a teenager. \u201cIt\u2019s hard enough.\u201d\nOn Thursday, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull proposed tough new requirements for would-be citizens, including stricter standards for English-language proficiency, an \u201cAustralian values\u201d test and a four-year wait. Mr. Do, a citizen who has made his life here in Darwin, now worries that his wife, Lahn, a permanent resident who can barely read or write, will never obtain citizenship and fully belong.\n\u201cWe want this to be our country,\u201d Mr. Do said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here a long time.\u201d\nThe proposed changes are the latest challenge to Australia\u2019s proud multicultural image, after a tightening of skilled worker visas this week. Taken together, the moves put Australia at the forefront of a global movement to limit migration, and to turn citizenship from something meant to help people integrate into what Mr. Turnbull called a \u201cbig prize\u201d \u2014 a reward for having assimilated.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Those who favor raising the barriers, including members of the Trump administration, argue that citizenship is a privilege that should be given only to those who can prove they have made a significant effort to adapt to their new country.\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story Populists in Europe, the United States and elsewhere \u2014 including, in Australia, Pauline Hanson , a senator who has called for a ban on Muslim immigration \u2014 have often relied on this argument to rally frustrated working-class voters who fear Islam or believe they are competing with immigrants for jobs or government resources.\nPhoto Nhan Do, 41, and his son Raymond, 7.

Credit Damien Cave/The New York Times Here in Darwin, a northern outpost closer to Indonesia than it is to Sydney, and across Australia, there is little doubt that Mr. Turnbull is focusing on immigration because his government is at risk of being toppled, by rivals on the right or left.\n\u201cCitizenship and immigration policy is being used specifically for political ends,\u201d said Henry Sherrell, a research officer in the Development Policy Center at Australian National University.\nBen Saul, the Challis chair of international law at Sydney Law School, agreed, saying there was no apparent need for the changes. \u201cThere is little evidence that the current Australian citizenship processes are being abused or admit the \u2018wrong\u2019 kind of citizens,\u201d he said.\nAustralia has been a quiet example of successful mass immigration, perhaps more so than much of the world realizes. About 27 percent of its population is foreign-born, from more than 200 countries \u2014 roughly double the ratio in the United States and in England.\nThe country already requires new immigrants to have substantial knowledge of English and civics. Its extensive citizenship test can only be taken in English, and it includes questions about freedom of speech and other democratic norms.\nCriminal background checks are also required. And immigrants who receive the most common temporary work or study visas must sign a \u201c values statement \u201d that includes principles like: \u201cAustralian citizenship is a shared identity, a common bond which unites all Australians while respecting their diversity.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Kevin Kadirgamar, an immigration lawyer in Darwin and president of the Multicultural Council of the Northern Territory, a nonprofit group that hosts citizenship classes for immigrants, said that if the goal was inclusion and integration, Australia had much to build on.

And now we\u2019re putting up new barriers to that.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m bewildered as to how some of these changes, such as the English-language testing requirement and the longer wait for citizenship, align with Australian values,\u201d he said.\nSupporters of the shift argued that the new policies would reinforce values like fair treatment of women and children. Mr. Turnbull said that the additional requirements were good for immigrants as well as the country.\n\u201cI mean, does anybody doubt that if you want to succeed, if you want to even have a chance of succeeding in Australia, you need to be able to speak English?\u201d he said.\nThe immigrants most likely to be affected are those who have come on humanitarian visas, since those who arrive with work or study visas already must pass rigorous English tests.\nMr. Do, who was picking up his son Thursday at a school for children with special needs, said his wife was eager to become a citizen because of the peace of mind it afforded her when she visited relatives in rural Vietnam. It is the same peace of mind he feels, having fled political oppression in that country.\n\u201cWhen you have that passport, you feel safe,\u201d said Mr. Do, who said his father was thrown in jail by Vietnam\u2019s Communist government when he was a child. \u201cIf something goes wrong, they\u2019ll protect you.\u201d\nPhoto The flags of more than 50 nations in the Parliament House for the Northern Territory in its capital, Darwin.

Border officials did not respond to a request for those figures.\nIn the United States, millions of immigrants who could become citizens do not do so, often citing the expense and challenge of the citizenship test. Many immigrants here are said to express similar concerns.\nIn 2015-16, 102,029 people took the citizenship test, and 3,447 people failed it more than three times, according to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection.\nUnder the new rules, which must be approved by Parliament, three failures would mean the end of a person\u2019s attempt to become a citizen.

| Updated 7 hours ago North Korea Warns Of 'Super-Mighty Preemptive Strike' As U.S. Weighs Next Move The reclusive country regularly threatens to destroy Japan, South Korea and the U.S., and has shown no let-up in its belligerence after a failed missile test on Sunday \nSEOUL, April 20 (Reuters) - North Korean state media warned the United States of a \u201csuper-mighty preemptive strike\u201d after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the United States was looking at ways to bring pressure to bear on North Korea over its nuclear program. \nPresident Donald Trump has taken a hard line with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who has rebuffed admonitions from sole major ally China and proceeded with nuclear and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions. \nThe Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the North\u2019s ruling Workers\u2019 Party, did not mince its words. \n\u201cIn the case of our super-mighty preemptive strike being launched, it will completely and immediately wipe out not only U.S. imperialists\u2019 invasion forces in South Korea and its surrounding areas but the U.S. mainland and reduce them to ashes,\u201d it said. KCNA KCNA / Reuters Military vehicles carry missiles during a military parade marking the 105th birth anniversary of country's founding father Kim Il Sung, \nReclusive North Korea regularly threatens to destroy Japan, South Korea and the United States and has shown no let-up in its belligerence after a failed missile test on Sunday, a day after putting on a huge display of missiles at a parade in Pyongyang. \n\u201cWe\u2019re reviewing all the status of North Korea, both in terms of state sponsorship of terrorism as well as the other ways in which we can bring pressure on the regime in Pyongyang to re-engage with us, but re-engage with us on a different footing than past talks have been held,\u201d Tillerson told reporters in Washington on Wednesday. \nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence, on a tour of Asian allies, has said repeatedly an \u201cera of strategic patience\u201d with North Korea is over. \nU.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said during a visit to London the military option must be part of the pressure brought to bear. \n\u201cAllowing this dictator to have that kind of power is not something that civilized nations can allow to happen,\u201d he said in reference to Kim. \nRyan said he was encouraged by the results of efforts to work with China to reduce tension, but that it was unacceptable North Korea might be able to strike allies with nuclear weapons. \nNorth and South Korea are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. \n\u2018MAX THUNDER\u2019 \nSouth Korea\u2019s acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, at a meeting with top officials on Thursday, repeatedly called for the military and security ministries to maintain vigilance. \nThe defense ministry said U.S. and South Korean air forces were conducting an annual training exercise, codenamed Max Thunder, until April 28. North Korea routinely labels such exercises preparations for invasion. \n\u201cWe are conducting a practical and more intensive exercise than ever,\u201d South Korean pilot Lieutenant Colonel Lee Bum-chul told reporters. \u201cThrough this exercise, I am sure we can deter war and remove our enemy\u2019s intention to provoke us.\u201d \nSouth Korean presidential candidates clashed on Wednesday night in a debate over the planned deployment in South Korea of a U.S.-supplied Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system, which has angered China. \nFrontrunner Moon Jae-in was criticized for leaving his options open before the May 9 election. \nOn Monday, Hwang and Pence reaffirmed their plans to go ahead with the THAAD, but the decision will be up to the next South Korean president. For its part, China says the system\u2019s powerful radar is a threat to its security. \nThe North has said it has developed a missile that can strike the mainland United States, but officials and experts believe it is some time away from mastering the necessary technology, including miniaturizing a nuclear warhead. RUSSIA, U.S. AT ODDS \nThe United States and Russia clashed at the United Nations on Wednesday over a U.S.-drafted Security Council statement to condemn North Korea\u2019s latest failed ballistic missile test. \nDiplomats said China had agreed to the statement. \nSuch statements by the 15-member council have to be agreed by consensus. \nPrevious statements denouncing missile launches \u201cwelcomed efforts by council members, as well as other states, to facilitate a peaceful and comprehensive solution through dialog.\u201d The latest draft statement dropped \u201cthrough dialog\u201d and Russia requested it be included again. \n\u201cWhen we requested to restore the agreed language that was of political importance and expressed commitment to continue to work on the draft ... the U.S. delegation without providing any explanations canceled the work on the draft,\u201d the Russian U.N. mission said in a statement. \nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China believed in the Security Council maintaining unity. \n\u201cSpeaking with one voice is extremely important to the Security Council appropriately responding to the relevant issue on the peninsula,\u201d he told reporters. \nThere has been some confusion over the whereabouts of a U.S. aircraft carrier group after Trump said last week he had sent an \u201carmada\u201d as a warning to North Korea, even as the ships were still far from Korean waters. \nThe U.S. military\u2019s Pacific Command explained that the USS Carl Vinson strike group first had to complete a shorter-than-planned period of training with Australia. It was now heading for the Western Pacific as ordered, it said. \nChina\u2019s influential Global Times newspaper, which is published by the People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party\u2019s official paper, wondered whether the misdirection was deliberate. \n\u201cThe truth seems to be that the U.S. military and president jointly created fake news and it is without doubt a rare scandal in U.S. history, which will be bound to cripple Trump\u2019s and U.S. dignity,\u201d it said.

Students waved rainbow flags at graduation, and the school hosted events featuring gay authors and artists. So many Chinese were alarmed when a message of intolerance emanated recently from the university\u2019s main campus in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province. \u201cProtect traditional Chinese morals,\u201d said a banner carried on campus by members of the women\u2019s basketball team. \u201cDefend core socialist values. Resist corrosion from decadent Western thoughts. Keep homosexuality far from campus.\u201d A photo of the students with the banner, posted online by the team\u2019s coach on Sunday, provoked immediate outrage, with people across China calling on the university to fire the coach and punish the students. The incident also prompted a broader conversation about discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students at Chinese schools. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story China, which until 1997 considered homosexuality a crime, has grown more tolerant of gay and lesbian people. Still, the country does not permit same-sex marriage , and discrimination is widespread, even at universities. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking to know things like this can happen,\u201d said Luo Yinxi, 21, a gay student at the university. On social media, students and activists called for the government to put in place greater protections for sexual minorities. \u201cThis incident will be over soon, but the scar of it is never going to be erased,\u201d one user wrote on WeChat, a popular messaging app. \u201cDon\u2019t wait until the next tragedy to make up for it.\u201d Activists started a hashtag, #NoQueerNoGame , to show solidarity with lesbian athletes at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, an elite school. Photo A counterbanner being held up by mothers of gay students at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, on Wednesday. Credit Lin Wei A group of mothers of gay students at the school took to the streets with a banner of their own. \u201cDon\u2019t let homophobes hurt our children!\u201d it said. They called on the university to investigate the incident. The women\u2019s basketball team at Huazhong University of Science and Technology had a history of harassment against lesbian players, according to students. Ling Bing, a coach of the team, posted anti-gay rants on his social media accounts. Even after the photo of the banner drew widespread criticism, Mr. Ling posted again to say it was a \u201cdouble standard\u201d that gay students could hold a rainbow flag at graduation but the banner held by the basketball team members was considered unacceptable.

Or is O'Reilly no more than a political bone? 04/20/2017 12:35 am ET | Updated 5 hours ago \nThe cheering of liberals, progressives, well-mannered, morally decent, and socially conscious people of every stripe over the ousting of Fox News megastar Bill O\u2019Reilly has been raucous and widespread. The reality that this seemingly indestructible Goliath of right-wing cable news could be toppled by women attesting to his predatory and assaultive behaviors inspired many a Tweet, post, article, treatise on the topic of sexual harassment. The sheen of schadenfreude has been layered thick and gooey, and even the most noble of social commentators is likely feeling some measure of \u201che had it comin\u2019!\u201d (though apparently not the man in the White house, whose own pedigree of sexually assaultive behaviors compelled an \u201c I don\u2019t think Bill did anything wrong \u201d defense of his buddy.) \nPerhaps it is that reality \u2014 that Trump wrangled his new job despite spewing some of the most sexually denigrating tripe about women \u2014 that\u2019s caused many on both sides of the moral divide to presume O\u2019Reilly was indestructible. Untouchable. And why wouldn\u2019t we think that when one of the most repugnant, self-admitted sexual abusers has been allowed into the damn White House! \nOn top of that, we\u2019ve watched countless women of merit and substance attest to sexual assault and harassment involving these slippery titans only to see those same women dismissed, belittled, and disbelieved, the clear message being: \u201cIn a he-say/she-say scenario, the she-say will never trump the he.\u201d We have a long history of that patriarchal response in America, so much so that rape and sexual harassment are grievously under-reported. But, certainly with rape, where the \u201c majority of perpetrators will not go to jail, \u201d and in harassment cases where famous, powerful men are generally believed over their victims, it\u2019s only the strongest woman who will put herself through the double-jeopardy of first being victimized by an abuser, then by those who refuse to believe her. \nGiven those odds, much will be made of the fact that O\u2019Reilly was toppled by a bevy of strong women stepping forward despite cultural pushback, but the reality is likely less noble. According to a piece in The Atlantic, Why Was Bill O\u2019Reilly Really Fired? , the rationale is a heady mix of, yes, a morality assessment ( \u201cThe allegations are disturbing and, given the importance of women in every aspect of our business, we don\u2019t feel this is a good environment in which to advertise our products right now.\u201d ), but also an economic one: 21st Century Fox\u2019s pending takeover of Sky TV, the European pay-TV company, in a deal said to be worth $14 billion. \u201cOn May 16,\u201d New York magazine reported, \u201cthe British media regulator Ofcom is set to judge whether the Murdochs are \u2018fit and proper\u2019 to own such a large media property.\u201d And \u201cremoving O\u2019Reilly could appease critics and help close the Sky deal.\u201d You know what\u2019s worth more than $446 million? [ The Factor\u2019s advertising revenues ] $14 billion. \n\u201cMorality via math,\u201d as The Atlantic put it, but you know what? WE\u2019LL TAKE IT. \nWhatever financial concerns powered what is ultimately the right move morally, the fact is: a rich, famous, powerful man was fired because he abused women. No matter how it\u2019s parsed, spun, twisted, or minimized, that\u2019s big. His very public and humiliating termination can\u2019t help but send a powerful message, one desperately needed as a matter of course, but certainly needed after Trump\u2019s election: that abuse of women will not be tolerated, even by those with wealth and power. \nBut will that message get across? Will it sustain; make a dent? Does it mean culture-at-large is becoming less tolerant, less willing to look away, less forgiving of sexual violence and abuse? Will it have an impact in a society where men in the military illegally hack nude photos of both male and female compatriots to expose online ; where teenage boys in Steubenville claimed to not know that digitally assaulting an unconscious girl is considered rape; where a privileged Stanford swimmer got only a wrist-slap for his horrific act of violence against an inebriated woman, and where rape in the military continues to be an egregious and pervasive problem? \nIn every one of those scenarios, the caustic, violent, and predatory behaviors of largely young men are the common threads, men who have somehow become inured to the repugnance of their actions; men who have learned, assimilated, or been taught that abusing, harassing, or raping women is (unfathomably) excusable in certain circumstances: when a woman is drunk, passive, incapable of self-protecting behaviors. When a woman is serving in a system of powerful, gender-based patriarchy. When a woman is in private possession of images not meant for public consumption. When a woman is building a career and looking for honest sponsorship from men who can offer it. When a woman is... a woman. \nSomehow, legions of young men have grown up either not being taught and mentored in moral, ethical, respectful conduct toward women, or they\u2019re picking up negative attitudes embodied by the men in their lives: fathers, family members, coaches, peers, bosses, older opinion leaders. Whatever the components, the resulting equation turns boys into men like Bill O\u2019Reilly, Bill Cosby, Roger Ailes, and yes, Donald Trump. And that needs to change. Desperately. \nIn an example of art mirroring culture, the truth of how we adults raise our boys and girls to comport themselves on this issue came into high relief as I watched the new Netflix series, Thirteen Reasons Why . Adapted from a book by the same name, it tells the deeply painful story of a high school girl\u2019s suicide brought on by a critical mass of bullying, sexual harassment, and, terrifyingly, two different rapes. As savvy as I am about modern culture, and having a son who was, not all that long ago, in high school, I was stunned by the depiction of both the gauntlet girls are forced to walk as they make their way through school, as well as the seemingly acceptable bullying by privileged males whose disproportionate power renders them untouchable, their value as athletes vaunted above their value as human beings of integrity. In that scenario, the girls become invisible victims, while the shiny exteriors of aggrandized boys blinds the adults from recognizing and intervening effectively. If this series, by any measure, accurately illustrates high school in America, we\u2019ve got some serious work to do. It\u2019s learned behavior, and we\u2019ve got to preempt it: \nMen, women, mothers, fathers, teachers, mentors, and coaches : When it comes to the boys, we\u2019ve got to teach , exemplify and demand respectful, courteous, ethical behaviors toward women. ALL women. Young, old, pretty, homely; lovely or hell on wheels. That goes for what we say, how we act, the way we treat their mothers (and, for us mothers, the way we treat ourselves); the way we respond to the other females in their lives, both young and old. We must banish any tendency to say things like: \u201cboys will be boys,\u201d \u201cit\u2019s just locker room talk,\u201d or \u201cshe was asking for it\u201d or \u201che\u2019s just being a guy.\u201d If you think any of the behaviors I\u2019ve enumerated above are even remotely acceptable, you need to enlighten yourself. Maybe sit down and watch Thirteen Reasons Why and educate yourself about what those kinds of acts can lead to, both in terms of destroying lives and turning out boys who remain predators. \nWhen it comes to the girls in our care, we\u2019ve not only got to treat them with the respect and courtesy they deserve, we\u2019ve got to teach them how to demand it for themselves. How to enjoy feeling attractive, desirable, and appealing without becoming passive, overly-needy, and self-negating. For me as a woman, one of the most troubling aspects of Thirteen Reasons Why was watching the passivity and acquiescence of the young women involved, girls who were doing and allowing things they didn\u2019t actually want, didn\u2019t honestly believe in, but somehow didn\u2019t have the wherewithal, the tools, the inner strength or sense of self to push back as needed. In their desire to feel wanted, be seen as popular, likable, as \u201cnot a problem,\u201d they succumbed to pressures that left them vulnerable, often in dangerous situations in which they were ultimately victimized. \nSo while we teach our boys to be good men, we\u2019ve got to set our girls up to be strong and self-loving, armed with coping skills to withstand sexual bullying and peer pressure; offering perspective that allows them to see themselves as valuable and worthy without needing the approval of those who might abuse, negate, denigrate, or violate them. We\u2019ve got to come at it from all sides; it\u2019s that big a problem. \nI may be an optimist, but I hope O\u2019Reilly\u2019s firing is the start of, or maybe an expansion of, a new cultural meme on the topic of sexual assault and harassment. That he will be held as an example of what happens to callous boys who become men who abuse women. That the women who stood up to him will be seen as beacons of female power for those young girls finding their way through the politics of being women. That we are making an essential turn in the march toward gender equality and integrity, one that will ultimately lead to a society that could never excuse the repugnant behaviors of men like O\u2019Reilly, Ailes, Cosby, and, sadly, the current man in the White House. \nWe\u2019ll know when we get there. For now, let\u2019s celebrate; this event is a small but a worthy victory on the road to decency. \nFollow Lorraine Devon Wilke on Facebook , Twitter and Amazon .

So here\u2019s a thought: what if they all clubbed together and just decided to beat the Tories?\u201d \nIt\u2019s a compelling thought, if you ignore political reality and you can genuinely imagine Nicola Sturgeon playing Nick Clegg to a Prime Minister Corbyn. If you could get the so-called \u2018progressive coalition\u2019 of Labour, the Lib Dems, the SNP and the Greens to vote in perfect harmony, with all their existing supporters voting tactically in perfect harmony to keep the Tories out in each seat, what would actually happen?\nLet\u2019s start with the 2015 election results. The Tories needed 323 seats to win a majority, and captured 330. To achieve this they won 11.3 million votes to Labour\u2019s 9.3 million; but if you combined Labour\u2019s vote with the Lib Dem, Green and SNP votes, a coalition could have beaten the Tories by over 3 million votes. That would surely have kicked Cameron out of power, right?\nLet\u2019s look at the data, courtesy of Electoral Calculus . (Sensitive Guardian readers and committed socialists may want to look away now.)\nI looked at what would happen if every single Green voter switched to Labour last year, and the answer was \u2018not a lot\u2019. The Tories would have lost 10 seats and Cameron would still likely have formed a government. \nYou might think the Liberal Democrats would make a bigger impact. If every single Lib Dem and Labour voter had coordinated perfectly to inflict the maximum possible damage on Tory prospects, it would still have only swung 32 seats \u2013 17 to Labour and 15 to the Lib Dems. Places like Lewes, Eastbourne, Colchester, and Portsmouth South would have swung to the Lib Dems, while constituencies like Thurrock, Watford, Telford and Warrington South would have been nudged into Labour\u2019s column.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A perfectly-executed Lib/Lab pact could have only captured a handful of seats from the Tories in 2015. \nThat would have left the Tories on 299, but with the Lib Dems now on 23 and Labour still far behind on 249, the likelihood is that the existing Coalition government of 2010-15 would have continued. \nTo have any chance of toppling it the Green, Lib Dem and Labour votes would have had to be perfectly coordinated. SNP voters would make little difference, as the Tories only have 1 seat in Scotland anyway. This would have reduced the Tories to 286, and an alliance could technically have made it over the line with about 340 seats. But with Labour still trailing the Tories on 259 seats, a constitutional crisis would have been more likely than Ed Miliband entering Number 10.\nThese are of course ridiculous scenarios. Even if it were true that 100% of Lib Dem, Green and SNP voters preferred a Labour government to a Tory one, which is complete nonsense to start with, getting every single one to vote correctly - or at all - would be impossible. A progressive coalition may have been mathematically possible - just - in 2015, but in reality it was totally implausible. \nMuch has changed since 2015 of course. We\u2019ve had the EU Referendum, a shiny new Prime Minister, and 18 months of Jeremy Corbyn scowling on the telly, so are things looking up for the progressive coalition idea?\nHA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA no not really. \nLet\u2019s look at some updated figures: and please don\u2019t hate me, I\u2019m just doing maths. Electoral Calculus keeps an updated projection of vote tallies on its site , based on recently polling. Yes polls aren\u2019t perfect, but neither are they particularly inaccurate. The numbers won\u2019t be spot on, but they probably won\u2019t be miles out \u2013 the basic character is the same either way.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Perfect tactical voting by Lib/Lab/Green voters, even assuming they preferred a Labour government to a Tory one, would fail miserably based on current polling. \nAt present, the Tories look set to win about 392 seats with Labour crashing to the Hagueish total of 170. A perfectly-executed Lab/Lib pact could reduce that to about 361, handing 25 seats to Labour and 6 to the Lib Dems. SNP voters can make little difference since progressives already hold 58/59 Scottish seats and the Tories aren\u2019t expected to gain any. If all progressive voters were directed by an all-seeing omnipotent god-being to perfectly optimize their vote then the Tories would land in the 330s. That would still leave them over 100 ahead of Labour (on 217) and be enough to form a majority.\nIn summary: even if a progressive coalition made any sort of political sense in a reality where Tim Farron and Nicola Sturgeon would have to prop up a guy who can\u2019t even claim a majority of his own MPs; it would require a polling error unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen combined with literally an act of God for it to work. \nGood luck with that, guys.\n\nArticle amended on 20 April 2017 to clarify the impact of SNP voters.

He was scheduled to leave later that morning for America to attend his daughter\u2019s eighth birthday party. But instead, the 35-year-old Kara-Murza, a fearless and persistent critic of Vladimir Putin, was suddenly gripped with the knowledge that, for the second time in two years, his life was in danger. \u201cMy heart was racing, I was sweating,\u201d he told Yahoo News\u2019 Bianna Golodryga in an interview. \u201cIt became really difficult to breathe. \u2026 It was really frightening. I knew I only had a few minutes in which I could still do something.\u201d\nKara-Murza called his wife, who lives in the Washington suburbs. She immediately phoned a prominent Moscow doctor who had treated him the last time this happened. Kara-Murza was rushed to a Moscow hospital, where in the hours that followed, the doctors frantically tried to figure out what was happening to his body.\nOne by one, Kara-Murza\u2019s kidneys, lungs and other organs began to shut down. \u201cAll my organs failed within six hours,\u201d he said. \u201cBy that evening, I was in a coma and was on life support.\u201d The doctors inserted a breathing tube. They brought in a dialysis machine and cleaned his blood, seeking to purge whatever foreign substance had invaded his body. Kara-Murza stayed unconscious for a week but miraculously survived. When he was released three weeks later, the discharge papers recorded the diagnosis: \u201cToxic action by an undefined substance.\u201d\nIt was virtually the same diagnosis as before, in May 2015, when Karza-Murza was rushed to the hospital and also fell into a coma. He had been poisoned twice in less than two years. Somebody in Russia very much wanted Kara-Murza dead.\n\u201cI could never imagine this happening \u2014 not to mention to our family,\u201d said Evgenia Kara-Murza in a joint interview with her husband at the Russian restaurant, Mari Vanna . \u201cIt\u2019s unthinkable.\u201d\n\u201cFollow the trail of dead Russians,\u201d said former FBI intelligence analyst Clint Watts when asked at a Senate intelligence committee hearing how the panel could unravel the aggressive role that Moscow played in the 2016 election.\nAnd, as Kara-Murza notes, the trail is a long one: Anna Politkosvkaya, a journalist, shot dead in the stairwell of her Moscow apartment in 2006. Alexander Litvinenko, a defector from the Russian security services who turned on Putin, poisoned in London the same year. Boris Nemtsov, Kara-Murza\u2019s best friend and hero, murdered in the shadow of the Kremlin in February 2015. Denis Voronenkov, a former Russian lawmaker who spoke out against Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, shot dead in broad daylight in front of a hotel in Kiev just last month.\n\u201cI\u2019m the fortunate one,\u201d said Kara-Murza. \u201cBoris Nemtsov \u2014 they put five bullets in his back on that bridge in front of the Kremlin. So many people \u2014 political prisoners, independent journalists, anticorruption campaigners \u2014 have lost their lives in various ways over the last 17 years that Vladimir Putin has been in power. And every time, there is some kind of plausible deniability. Every time, they say, \u2018Oh, we had nothing to do with this. Oh, this just happened.\u2019 But you know there is a kind of very strange high mortality rate among the people that have crossed the Kremlin\u2019s path that defies any kind of normal statistical model.\u201d\nIt is a record for lethality that has not gone unnoticed among U.S. government officials who have dealt with Kara-Murza and followed his case. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that he was targeted for his activity against the Russian government,\u201d said Tom Malinowski, who until last January served as former President Barack Obama\u2019s assistant secretary of state for human rights. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who it was. He doesn\u2019t know who it was. But we do know that in virtually every single hit against a journalist or an opposition leader, no one has been held accountable \u2026 and for that Putin is responsible.\u201d\nBut in almost all these cases, there are lingering questions. What was the poison that almost killed Kara-Murza, and how had it been administered? Kara-Murza and his doctors remain at a loss. Kara-Murza was a human rights activist who spent his days in a constant whirl of meetings, rallies and political events \u2014 almost always trailed by various agents of Russia\u2019s security services. He would have seven to eight meetings every day in caf\u00e9s and restaurants. It is, he says, impossible to pinpoint who and where someone had injected something into his food or drink.\nRead More But what is known is that Russia\u2019s security services have a long record of poisoning their political opponents, and they have gotten increasingly sophisticated at it. Some of the substances they use can delay taking effect for as long as a week.\n\u201cUsing poison is a rather effective way of getting rid of your opponents,\u201d said Evgenia Kara-Murza. \u201cBecause in numerous cases, the exact toxins have never been found. So they can say, \u2018He ate something. He got food poisoning.\u2019 It happens\u2026 In the case of poisoning, how would you actually prove it? \u2026 Their laboratories have been known to develop toxins that are completely untraceable.\u201d\nBut whoever did it had miscalculated, ever so slightly. Kara-Murza had booked his plane from Moscow to Washington for later that morning. Had the toxin kicked in just a few hours later, Kara-Murza would have been outside of Russian territory, in international air space, unable to make it to a hospital. The Russian government could disavow anything to do with Kara-Murza\u2019s murder. \u201cThey could say it didn\u2019t happen here,\u201d he said.\nWhat was not a puzzle was the likely motive. Kara-Murza had been a thorn in the side of the Putin regime for years. The son of a distinguished historian, who vividly remembers the high hopes for democracy that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Kara-Murza had in recent years been leading protest rallies throughout his country. He, along with Nemtsov, was a key figure in the protests in December 2011 that brought more than 100,000 people into the streets of Moscow to protest the electoral fraud that was returning Putin to power. He had been a tireless crusader for the so-called Magnitsky Act \u2014 a law passed by the U.S. Congress in 2012, named for Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian auditor who had uncovered a massive tax fraud scheme involving Kremlin officials and ended up dead in a Russian jail. The law infuriated the Kremlin and at first faced quiet but determined opposition from the Obama administration, which feared that the law would upset its cherished \u201creset\u201d of relations with Russia.\nThe Magnitsky Act gave the U.S. government authority to impose targeted financial sanctions against senior Russian officials implicated in human rights abuses. On Jan. 10 of this year, with less than two weeks left in the Obama presidency, the State Department imposed the toughest sanctions yet under the law: It targeted Alexander Bastrykin, until recently the chief of the Russian Federation\u2019s Investigative Committee, the equivalent of this country\u2019s FBI. \u201cPutin\u2019s enforcer,\u201d Malinowski called him at the time as he announced the action. (Among the evidence in the U.S. government\u2019s dossier: Bastrykin had once summoned a journalist to a forest and threatened to kill him over a critical article \u2014 and then joked that he would \u201cpersonally\u201d handle the murder investigation .)\nAlso on the Magnitsky Act list were two notorious former agents of the Russian security service, the FSB: Dmitry Kovtun and Andre Lugovoi. There was a pointed message to their inclusion. Seven years earlier, they had flown to London and, according to a later British government inquiry, administered the radioactive substance \u2014 believed to be polonium \u2014 that had killed Litvinenko.\nThe U.S. government, in short, was going after Putin\u2019s poisoners. And Kara-Murza, for his part, kept up the pressure: Just as the sanctions were being announced, he sent a blistering letter to the U.S. Senate urging its members to review Putin\u2019s human rights record when considering President Trump\u2019s nomination of Rex Tillerson to be secretary of state: Russian media outlets, he wrote, \u201cserve as mouthpieces for government propaganda.\u201d The country\u2019s elections have turned into a \u201cmeaningless ritual\u201d with voting \u201cmarred by intimidation and fraud.\u201d The judiciary and law enforcement agencies \u201care used to punish the government\u2019s political opponents.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not the task for outside powers to influence the political situation in Russia,\u201d Kara-Murza wrote. \u201cOnly Russian citizens can and should do that. But it is important to consider the nature of our current government in the context of international relations.\u201d\nThree weeks later, Kara-Murza was in a coma. He is now recovering with his family in the vicinity of Washington, but he plans to return to Moscow and has no intention of backing down. He is encouraged, he said, by new protests that swept through Russia in March after disclosures that Putin\u2019s prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev \u2014 once Obama\u2019s favored interlocutor for the reset \u2014 had amassed more than $1 billion in holdings , including mansions, luxury yachts, country estates and a Tuscany vineyard, acquired through offshore companies registered in Cyprus.\n\u201cThese were the largest wave of protests we had since the early \u201990s, since the breakup of the Soviet Union,\u201d said Kara-Murza. Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators came out in 84 cities and towns throughout the country. Although physically unable to participate, Kara-Murza had helped plant the seeds during years of organizing work.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen these people, these young people who came out to our events, who took part in debates and discussions,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the Putin generation. These are the people who were certainly raised and, in many cases, born under Vladimir Putin. \u2026 All they\u2019ve seen is his face for their whole lives on their television screens. And they\u2019re fed up with it.\u201d\nThere will be more such protests, later this month and again in June, he said. And for all his personal travails, Kara-Murza sees grounds for optimism \u2014 a turning point that he is convinced is one day coming, perhaps soon.\n\u201cOne thing that history teaches us: All such regimes end. One way or another, nothing is forever,\u201d he said. Putin \u201cthinks he\u2019s going to be there forever. But he\u2019s not. We don\u2019t know when precisely it\u2019s going to happen. But we know that one day this regime will be consigned to history.\u201d\nIn his hospital discharge papers provided to Yahoo News, Vladimir Kara-Murza\u2019s record show he had been stricken with \u201cToxic action by an undefined substance.\u201d More", "crawled": "2017-04-20T13:24:19.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-20T13:24:19.000+03:00", "uuid": "947250e693debd011b4328d6217ece06ab2ffb4f",

Navigation Cover Photo The Aedes aegypti mosquito, which transmits Zika and other viruses. Credit Andrew Bettles for The New York Times Why the Menace of Mosquitoes Will Only Get Worse Climate change is altering the environment in ways that increase the potential for viruses like Zika. By MARYN MCKENNA Continue reading the main story T he outbreak began so slowly that no one in Dallas perceived it at first. In June 2012, a trickle of people began showing up in emergency rooms broiling with fever, complaining that their necks were stiff and that bright lights hurt their eyes. The numbers were initially small; but by the middle of July, there were more than 50 victims each week, slumping in doctors\u2019 offices or carried into hospitals comatose or paralyzed from inflammation in their brains. In early August, after nine people died, Dallas County declared a state of emergency: It was caught in an epidemic of what turned out to be West Nile virus, the worst ever experienced by a city in the United States. By the end of the year, 1,162 people had tested positive for the mosquito-borne virus; 216 had become sick enough to be hospitalized; and 19 were dead. West Nile was not new to the United States. It had been a minor summer threat since August 1999, when it made 17 people sick in New York City. That was the virus\u2019s first entry into the country, and it expanded through it thereafter. It landed in Dallas in 2002, sickening 202 people and killing 13. When it moved on toward the West Coast, epidemiologists in the city thought West Nile would no longer be a threat. And events seemed to prove them right: Each year, there were just a handful of cases. In 2011, the year before the epidemic, there was only one. \u201cWe all thought these things come as a flash in the pan: one big outbreak and then you don\u2019t see them again,\u201d Dr. Robert Haley says. Haley is the director of epidemiology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and a former disease detective at the C.D.C. After the last cases were recorded in the final days of 2012, he and a team of researchers studied the episode. Right away, they could see the geography of the illness: Victims were clustered in affluent ZIP codes where many owners had walked away from overmortgaged mansions. Haley and his team knew that there would be abandoned swimming pools and potted plants there \u2014 perfect places for mosquitoes to breed unbothered. But the financial crisis was four years old in 2012. The homes had been neglected for years without triggering an epidemic; no matter how many mosquitoes bred in the summer, the deep cold that blankets central Texas a dozen days every winter would knock the bugs down again. Except, Haley remembered, it had not been very cold that year. There was only one night of hard frost; everyone had talked about it, grateful they did not have to dash out to wrap plants and turn off hose taps while thermometers plunged. The investigators downloaded federal weather data for each year since West Nile first arrived in Texas and plotted the metrics against the case counts. The epidemic year was an outlier on every measure, with the warmest winter, the warmest spring and the heaviest early rainfall in 10 years. It had been a freak weather event, and mosquitoes benefited from it. The insects survived the winter, so there were more of them to start with. They woke sooner, spilled out earlier from their winter hiding places and bit people in greater numbers than in any other year, transmitting so much virus that it made many people gravely ill. Continue reading the main story That Dallas\u2019s unusual weather favored the growth of mosquitoes might seem like random bad luck. But Haley doesn\u2019t think of it as an accident. He considers it a warning. Climate change is turning abnormal weather into a common occurrence: Last year was the warmest year on record, the third in a row, and there were more heat waves, freezes and storms in the United States that caused $1 billion or more in damage just in 2016 than in the years 1980 to 1984 combined. Anything that improves conditions for mosquitoes tips the scales for the diseases they carry as well: the West Nile virus that flattened Dallas, the dengue that returned to Florida in 2009 after 63 years and the newest arrival, Zika, which gained a toehold in the United States last year and is expected to surge this summer. \u201cThese aberrant years are becoming more common,\u201d Haley told me. \u201cClimate change is clearly altering the environment in ways that increase the potential for these diseases.\u201d The Climate Issue 6 Mosquitoes By Maryn McKenna When the health effects of climate change are discussed, the planet-scale impacts get the attention: rising temperatures, which can cause death from overheating; earlier springs, which pump more pollen toward the allergic; runoff from violent storms, which washes fecal bacteria out of sewer pipes; changing airflows that trap ozone near the ground, stressing the systems of people living with heart disease. The unpredictable weather patterns stimulated by climate change affect infectious diseases, as well as chronic ones. Warmer weather encourages food-borne organisms like salmonella to multiply more rapidly, and warmer seas foster the growth of bacteria like Vibrio that make oysters unsafe to eat. Spikes in heat and humidity have less visible effects, too, changing the numbers and distribution of the insect intermediaries that carry diseases to people. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story When former Vice President Al Gore spoke at a meeting on climate and health in Atlanta in February, he chose to start his talk not with a starving polar bear or a glacier falling into the sea, but with images of mosquitoes and ticks. \u201cClimate change is tilting the balance, disrupting natural ecosystems and giving more of an advantage to microbes,\u201d Gore said, standing in front of a giant image of Aedes aegypti, the mosquito species that transmits yellow fever and dengue, and now the Zika virus as well. \u201cChanging climate conditions change the areas in which these diseases can take root and become endemic.\u201d Right now, yellow fever is causing an epidemic in South America, and dengue has been increasing in Central America. But in the United States, the most alarming disease linked to mosquitoes is Zika, which can cause devastating birth defects. Zika has been a persistent concern since January 2016, when a Houston man became the mainland United States\u2019 first case, arriving back from a trip to El Salvador with the fever, rash and red eyes of full-blown infection. Now more than 5,200 U.S. residents have come down with the virus, at least one in every state except Alaska. The vast majority were infected by being bitten outside the country, and a small number by having sex with someone who was infected that way. But more than 220 people have caught Zika from local mosquitoes carrying the virus. Almost all of those victims live near Miami, and six live in Brownsville, Tex., along the Mexican border. No one can say yet whether those clusters are random blips or early indications of a pattern of transmission that will blow up into an epidemic when the weather warms this year. Aedes aegypti are present in more than half the states, from California to Florida and as far-flung as San Francisco, Kansas City and New Haven; entomologists have found that they regularly survive through the winter in sheltered spots in Washington, D.C. Unlike the salt-marsh mosquitoes that whine through beach towns at twilight or the night-biting Culex that carry West Nile between birds and humans, aegypti prefer proximity to people; we are their favorite meal. To get to us, they fly into houses and conceal themselves in closets and under beds and furniture. They have evolved to breed in the tiny pools of water we carelessly create around us: in an abandoned tire, the saucer under a houseplant, even an upturned bottle cap. Like West Nile, Zika can cause high fevers and paralysis \u2014 but unlike West Nile, it can also trigger catastrophic birth defects in the children of women infected while they are pregnant. It appears to destroy brain tissue while a fetus is growing, causing the skull to collapse. It also seems to cause brain damage, and eye, ear and joint abnormalities later on \u2014 though what will happen to babies as they grow is uncertain, because all the children born to Zika-infected mothers are still toddlers. In the United States, the C.D.C. has identified that 1,311 women who were pregnant in the past year were possibly infected with Zika; 56 of their children were born with Zika-related birth defects. In seven cases, the pregnancies ended early, and the fetuses were shown to have been affected. The C.D.C. recently announced that nearly 10 percent of women infected while they were pregnant had a child with a birth defect \u2014 15 percent if they were infected in their first trimester. The combination of an ugly virus and a stealthy predator is unnerving \u2014 especially because in the year since that first Houston case, it has become clear that the United States is more vulnerable to Zika than anyone thought. Like generals basing their strategy on the last war they fought, public-health experts have set up their defenses based on what worked for previous threats. The traps that health departments bought to catch Culex mosquitoes are not attractive to Aedes. The spraying with pesticide by trucks and airplanes that knocks down nuisance mosquitoes cannot reach ones that have sneaked into buildings. The best defense against Aedes mosquitoes turns out to be not big municipal gestures but small individual actions: destroying their habitat by emptying the pools of water where they reproduce, and keeping them from eating by repairing windows screens and wearing bug repellent. Those strategies require that landlords and municipal authorities pay attention to housing repairs and garbage pickup, and ask families who probably have other priorities to stay alert to conditions they did not cause. Since the start of the Zika epidemic, a few disease experts have been warning that the parts of the United States where Aedes mosquitoes flourish \u2014 the Gulf Coast, especially its largest cities \u2014 are also those that possess the worst poverty and municipal neglect, and that are particularly vulnerable to an outbreak. \u201cThat\u2019s an invitation to Zika, right there,\u201d said Dr. Peter Hotez, the founding dean of Houston\u2019s National School of Tropical Medicine, as he glared at a heap of garbage in the city\u2019s Fifth Ward, a historic \u2014 and historically neglected \u2014 black community northeast of downtown. The garbage was resting in a grass-lined ditch where a more northern city would have put a sidewalk, an old accommodation to Houston\u2019s drenching afternoon thunderstorms. The ditch was damp, and so was the heap. There was a sodden mattress, a turned-over box spring, a pile of torn drywall, old tires and a dozen plastic bottles lying on their sides; there were scummy puddles caught in the tires and an inch of old rainwater in the soda bottles. The heap was stacked against a sign that said \u201cNo Dumping.\u201d \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story We had driven past other piles, one every few blocks: lumber tossed on top of an old TV with the back torn off, Big Gulps and beer bottles spilling from contractor bags, a tumble of tires next to a \u201cFix Flat\u2019s\u201d sign. On the way into the neighborhood \u2014 seven miles but many tax brackets from Hotez\u2019s new labs in the Texas Medical Center, the largest collection of medical schools and hospitals in the world \u2014 Hotez had said it was plagued by dumping. Scofflaws would offload trash when no one was watching, trusting that the neighborhood\u2019s lack of political pull would keep them from being held accountable. It was clear the garbage infuriated him. In a colder city, it might have represented victimless cheating; in an area where the virus might land, it was a threat to mothers and children. \u201cWe have no historical expertise in how to do Aedes aegypti control,\u201d Hotez told me. \u201cWe\u2019ve never done it, and now we\u2019re playing catch-up in the middle of an epidemic.\u201d He glared at the garbage again. \u201cWe have the perfect mix of factors here for Zika transmission to begin.\u201d Every new disease feels like a shock, an unpredicted emergency that we have to scramble to catch up to. But at this point in American history, mosquito-borne illnesses ought not to take us by surprise. The epidemics they created shaped the United States from before it was a country; repeatedly, over hundreds of years, they caused towns to empty in panic and ports and state borders to slam shut. Yellow fever first arrived in 1693 with a boatload of British soldiers who sailed from Boston to attack the French-owned, sugar-producing island Martinique and caught the illness there. The return of the survivors \u2014 only 300 soldiers and 800 sailors, of the 4,200 who embarked \u2014 sparked an epidemic that sent residents fleeing to the countryside. In the summer of 1793, the fever was carried into Philadelphia by a merchant ship and killed more than 4,000 people, out of a population of roughly 40,000. In 1878, cargo barges moving up the Mississippi River from New Orleans took yellow fever to Memphis; 5,000 people died, and half the city evacuated to escape infection. When settlements moved south, mosquitoes were waiting. In 1839, when Texas was a newly independent republic and Houston was briefly its capital, a captain rowed ashore at the island of Galveston, its main port. He was returning from a trade run down the Mexican coast, and his son was ill on board; he begged the port authorities to let him see a doctor. When they berthed and unloaded, the virus went with them; the son died, the father died and Galveston and then Houston were swamped by an epidemic of yellow fever. More than 200 people died, 12 percent of the new city\u2019s population. (Later that year, the government relocated inland, to Austin.) In 1867, yellow fever came again, so hard that the island of Galveston was blockaded by boats outside the port and troops on the causeway to the mainland. \u201cThe fever is getting pretty bad indeed,\u201d Thomas Seargeant, 26, who was Gen. Robert E. Lee\u2019s attach\u00e9 in the just-concluded Civil War, wrote to his sister Annie in Stanford, Ky., on Aug. 13 that year. \u201cWe had 24 buried on Saturday, about the same Sunday and today I fear it will be equally as fatal.\u201d He was dead two weeks later. In 1885, a ship from the Caribbean landed with mosquitoes bearing dengue, which used to be called \u201cbreakbone fever\u201d for the severe joint pain it causes. It spread through Texas on the rail line that carried cargo inland; when it reached Austin, it sickened 16,000 people out of 22,000 living there. In 1935, malaria \u2014 carried by other mosquito species \u2014 sickened 25,000 people along the Texas coast, 1,500 just in Houston. Malaria was such a constant presence in the South, and its prostrating fevers so destructive to the productivity of farming and manufacturing, that when President Franklin Roosevelt created the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1933, its programs included malaria control among their priorities. When the United States entered World War II, the government created an Office of Malaria Control in War Areas to ensure boat and tank building would not be slowed down and soldiers in training would not be taken out of service. (Later it became the C.D.C.) In the midst of that history, on the other side of the world, researchers in 1947 trapped and caged a feverish rhesus monkey outdoors in the Zika Forest in Uganda, part of a study looking for yellow fever. The researchers who were monitoring the monkeys injected a sample of the sick monkey\u2019s blood into mice. The mice also got sick. The team harvested a pathogen from their brains \u2014 not yellow fever, the virus they expected, but something no one had seen before. They named it Zika. Since 1995, that virus has been stored in Galveston at the World Reference Center for Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses, which Dr. Robert Shope and Dr. Robert Tesh created at Yale University and then took south. In the collection, among the largest in the world, Zika was considered one of the least important samples. No agency had ever written a grant to study it. Shope died in 2004. Three years later, Zika caused its first known outbreak, infecting three-quarters of the population of Yap, a remote island in the Pacific, and leaving almost a quarter with fever, rashes, red eyes and joint pain. Yap lies 500 miles from any population center, and no one could demonstrate how the virus landed there \u2014 but in 2013, it leapt east across thousands more miles, sickening an estimated 19,000 people in French Polynesia. And then it jumped again, landing in Brazil and igniting a worldwide epidemic in 2015, focusing attention for the first time not just on the orphan virus but also on the Galveston lab that harbored it. Photo Aedes aegypti. Credit Andrew Bettles for The New York Times \u201cZika surprised everyone,\u201d Tesh says. \u201cJust as West Nile virus did. When West Nile came to the United States in 1999, we knew it had occurred in Africa and in the Middle East, but nobody thought of it as a serious problem. No one thought Zika would be of much significance either.\u201d \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Tesh, whom I met in a small office attached to his lab inside the University of Texas Medical Branch tower, spent much of his career hopscotching from the United States to developing nations, examining viruses in the places where they emerged. \u201cWhen Aedes aegypti was introduced to Panama in the 1980s, they started a big campaign of control,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey got all the school kids to go out and turn over containers. That worked for a year or two or three, and then people lose interest. The same thing happened here, when West Nile appeared in 2002. Everyone in Houston was very scared. They put out messages: Don\u2019t go to the baseball game at night. Wear repellent. Wear long-sleeved shirts. Then, after a year or two or three, who doesn\u2019t go out to watch the fireworks at night? Or a concert, or a baseball game? People forget.\u201d In the past century, according to the E.P.A., the average temperature in Texas has risen as much as one degree Fahrenheit \u2014 a noticeable twitch in a system that was stable for millenniums. Rainfall has increased in the central and eastern parts of the state, where most of the population resides. On the coast, the sea has risen nearly two inches per decade. Scientists have noticed the impact inland, too. \u201cWhen I came to El Paso eight years ago, you had to look to find Aedes aegypti here,\u201d Doug Watts, principal investigator at the University of Texas at El Paso\u2019s Mosquito Ecology and Surveillance Laboratory, told me. \u201cNow you find them in just about every backyard.\u201d The effects have rippled farther north as well. Since 1980, the amount of time when conditions are ideal for mosquitoes \u2014 more warmth, more humidity \u2014 have increased by five days in 125 American cities, according to the news and research organization Climate Central. In 10 cities, the mosquito season has grown by a month. In 21 cities \u2014 on the Atlantic Coast below Norfolk, Va.; in much of Florida; in Mobile, New Orleans, Beaumont outside Houston and south to Corpus Christi \u2014 mosquitoes are active at least 190 days per year. \u201cClimate change is certainly expanding the geographic range of mosquito species, and inevitably the diseases follow them,\u201d says Nikos Vasilakis, an associate professor at the University of Texas Medical Branch and a member of its Zika research effort. \u201cBut it also shortens what we call the extrinsic incubation period, the time it takes from when a mosquito takes a blood meal to when it becomes infectious. The standard is 14 days, but in warmer periods we can see it as short as nine or 10 days.\u201d If the impact of climate change on mosquitoes and the diseases they carry were predictable, anticipating what comes next might be simple. It is not. The perturbations that cause a moist early spring like the one Dallas had in 2012, favoring mosquito reproduction, can equally cause devastating floods \u2014 like the wall of water that swept through central Texas in May 2015 and killed 11 people \u2014 that will scour mosquito eggs from wherever they have been laid. Warming temperatures that allow mosquitoes to move north into new territory may also make their current territory inhospitable. In 2012, researchers at Texas Tech University estimated that in Chicago, rising temperatures would expand the length of the season for the mosquito that carries dengue \u2014 but in Atlanta and Lubbock, Texas Tech\u2019s home turf, summers would become so hot and dry that the risk of transmission would shift to spring and fall, when residents would not be on guard. The unpredictability will increase the challenge of preparing for diseases whose incidence will also increase. \u201cClimate change is a threat multiplier,\u201d Katharine Hayhoe, one of those researchers and a director of Texas Tech\u2019s Climate Science Center, told me. \u201cIf there\u2019s one overarching theme that connects almost every way that climate change impacts us, it\u2019s that climate change takes a risk that already exists and enhances it. It\u2019s not inventing something new. It\u2019s taking something that we\u2019ve already dealt with before, but giving it that extra oomph that makes it a bigger problem.\u201d One other factor complicates the calculation of how much of a threat mosquito-borne diseases pose, this summer and in years to come: the global movement of people. In its monthlong lifetime, an Aedes mosquito is unlikely to fly more than a quarter-mile from where it hatched. It is possible that an insect carrying the virus could fly into an airplane in one country, ride for thousands of miles and fly out into another; every few years, mosquitoes taking a trip like that cause clusters of what is called \u201cairport malaria.\u201d But it is much more likely that Zika will arrive in the bloodstream of an infected person, as yellow fever did in enslaved Africans in the 17th century and dengue in Caribbean traders in the 19th. Mosquitoes carry virus from one person to another, but it is the movement of those people \u2014 for pleasure or family ties or business, in flight from weather or strife \u2014 that transports it over borders and into new homes. There is no city in the parts of the United States hospitable to Zika that embodies migration more than Houston does. Its reach to the Gulf of Mexico and halfway to Austin is borderless and porous, a jostling sprawl of people who arrive on direct flights from 30 other countries and through one of the busiest container ports in the United States. One-fourth of its residents were born somewhere else. Harris County, which surrounds it, has 4.5 million residents, who speak 145 languages and live in 34 municipalities on 1,778 square miles, an area larger than Rhode Island. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story The possibility of locating the arrival of Zika in that complexity \u201cis a needle in a haystack, times two,\u201d Dr. Umair Shah says. The executive director of Houston\u2019s Public Health Department, Shah is a physician from Cincinnati who studied philosophy as an undergraduate and speaks three languages.

Real fight starts now , as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn makes his first major campaign speech in Westminster this morning. He might have voted for Theresa May \u2019s early election timetable ( and for article 50 ), but from now, he\u2019s playing by different rules, he\u2019ll tell his audience :\n\nMuch of the media and establishment are saying this election is a foregone conclusion \u2026 They say I don\u2019t play by the rules \u2013 their rules. We can\u2019t win, they say, because we don\u2019t play their game.\nThey\u2019re quite right: I don\u2019t. And a Labour government elected on 8 June won\u2019t play by their rules.\nThe Tories can keep \u201cfatcat bosses\u201d Philip Green and Mike Ashley , Corbyn will say : the Labour manifesto will be for \u201cthe nurse, the teacher, the small trader, the carer, the builder, the office worker\u201d.\nShould the nurse, the teacher et al not propel him into No 10, though, Corbyn might not follow the unwritten rules that usually see a defeated opposition leader step down. The Independent reports today that even if he loses, \u201cthere is a good chance Mr Corbyn will either refuse to resign or run again to retain power\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jeremy Corbyn: \u2018They say I don\u2019t play by the rules \u2026They\u2019re quite right.\u2019 Photograph: Dominic Lipinski/PA \nMaverick rule-ripping, too, from Theresa May , who is sticking to her refusal to take part in head-to-head TV debates, instead insisting she prefers to \u201cgo out and knock on doors\u201d to reach voters. Some 7 million people watched the 2015 ITV debate in which David Cameron squared off against Ed Miliband and co, so that\u2019s an ambitious door target. The BBC and ITV have confirmed they will screen leaders\u2019 debates, even if the actual leader isn\u2019t there to debate.\nPerhaps May\u2019s intention is to steer clear of what she is keen to label the \u201ccoalition of chaos\u201d , the Brexit naysayers who are dividing the country, once nostalgically known as \u201ca democratic opposition\u201d. After Nicola Sturgeon raised the prospect of an informal \u201cprogressive alliance\u201d to try to oust the Conservatives, the PM seized the chance to recycle a 2015 Cameron slogan (one previous owner, slightly tarnished). Corbyn categorically ruled out any such pact \u2013 but don\u2019t be surprised if some hastily recast versions of the Miliband-in-Salmond\u2019s-pocket ads sneak their way out of CCHQ regardless.\nAt a glance: \nMay backs Tory MPs investigated over 2015 election spending \u2013 even though some could face the possibility of being charged with offences mid-campaign.

Labour\u2019s self-inflicted weakness has presented the excuse \u2026\nNo prime minister, not even Mrs Thatcher, has complained that there should not be robust debate in parliament. That is a healthy and indeed necessary in any parliamentary democracy, but Theresa May does not seem willing to acknowledge any views other than hers. That simply isn\u2019t acceptable in a democracy.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon in London on Wednesday. Photograph: Will Oliver/EPA/REX/Shutterstock \nHere\u2019s Owen Jones on how Labour could up its media game:\n\nWhat the Tories traditionally do is shoehorn in their vision, whatever the question, and repeat it in some form or other throughout the interview. That can be quite irritating \u2013 and not just for their opponents \u2013 but this constant repetition of what they stand for, regardless of what question they are asked, is very effective. The electorate end up absorbing a big chunk both of how the Tories want to be seen, and how the Tories want to see their opposition \u2026\n\nThe Tories are very good at presenting THE CHOICE. On Brexit, for example, Labour could say: \u2018Voters have a clear choice. Either a Labour Brexit deal that keeps Britain in the single market and protects jobs, or a chaotic Tory Brexit deal that damages jobs, living standards and the economy.\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s not for me to pre-empt that clear Labour vision, but they have to present THE CHOICE as well. Here\u2019s where we stand in a sentence or two, and here, by way of contrast, is where the Tories stand.\nSuzanne Moore , in the Guardian , says voters will need to think tactically, too:\n\nMilitant remainers are delusional about how much support they have. They have mistakenly chosen to be led by discarded middle-aged Blairites and Nick Clegg. Many people just want politicians to get on with Brexit. They are not full of regret. But there is a real divide in this country; May is wrong to locate it in Westminster alone \u2026\nOpposition has to come from an alliance. It is Labour who have refused to countenance alliances. It is that party that will pay the price. The politics of purity have polluted the atmosphere so much that when May saw that she could get a clean sweep, she went for it. Who can stop her?\nRevelation of the day Nigel Farage has told the Sun that he fancies his chances of winning in South Thanet, where he finished second to Conservative Craig Mackinlay in 2015.

With the rise of nationalist sentiment around the world, countries from the west to the east have been making moves to weed out the foreign worker population for years now. \nHere\u2019s a look at some of the windows of opportunity that are being shuttered. The \u201cAmerica first\u201d fever \nOn April 18, Trump signed an executive order to overhaul America\u2019s H-1B program, which allows foreign employees to work in the US for up to six years. \nTrump\u2019s \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d directive will force Indian IT firms\u2014the top sponsors of visas from India \u2014to rethink their recruitment models. Industry bigwigs like Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), and Wipro, have been prepping for these restrictive measures for nearly a decade now with the knowledge that ramping up local hiring amidst America\u2019s chronic skills shortage could prove to be a challenge. \nAmid the winds of uncertainty that have been raging since Trump\u2019s elections, many Indians in the US have been looking to return home. This year, for the first time in five years , the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) saw a decline in the number of H-1B applicants. Simultaneously, the number of Indians in the US searching for jobs in India has gone up more than 10-fold between December and March, according to an analysis by consulting firm Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, shared exclusively with Mint . In the last month of 2016, approximately 600 US-based Indians were seeking jobs in India. By the end of last month, there were around 7,000. Clampdown in the UK \nThe UK is increasingly less hospitable for Indian students and workers alike. \nIn 2012, the country abolished its post-study work visa that let fresh graduates remain in the country for two years, so all those who did not graduate with a job in hand had to pack their bags and leave. The government also raised the maintenance funds (living expenses) a student needed to have in their bank accounts by 24% in 2015, shutting out some of the internal student population because of the ballooning cost. Between 2014 and 2015, the number of first-year Indians enrolling in UK universities dropped 10% from 11,270 to 10,125. \nIndian workers, who hold nearly 60% of the skilled foreign worker visas in the UK, faced similar woes as the country raised the salary threshold for different visas and added new English language requirements. Under the new rules, Tier 2 short-term intra-company transfers\u2014the provision under which Indian tech companies typically take their workers to the UK\u2014would be discontinued. This change went into effect on April 6. \nAlthough British Chancellor Phillip Hammond assured India that efforts to shrink migration of less-skilled labour would not impact India adversely, that did not hold true. At least 30,000 Indian software professionals currently working in the UK will not have their work permits renewed, India\u2019s National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) told The Hindu Business Line . Singapore\u2019s quiet retreat \nThe 5.6-million-strong island nation of Singapore has upped the resistance against Indian techies in recent years. In order to make sure that companies have a \u201cSingapore core,\u201d and to address concerns about overpopulation , officials have been \u201cshutting the tap down\u201d on Indian workers, according to Nasscom. \nIn 2015, Singapore adopted the Fair Consideration Framework to ensure employers are considering Singaporeans for vacancies. It requires, among other things, that an employer with over 25 employees advertise a vacancy for two weeks before applying for an employment pass for an international worker. Singaporean authorities are also reportedly asking Indian tech companies based in the region to carry out labor market testing, which Nasscom says violates the 2005 economic cooperation agreement between the two countries. Other measures to curb foreign worker populations include raising the bar for salaries and English proficiency. \nBefore these recent efforts, Indian tech companies were awarded between 5,000 and 10,000 work permits each year. Recently, the total population of Indian techies in Singapore has shriveled to under 10,000, NDTV reported . Applications\u2014which typically took two to four weeks to process\u2014have been held up for months, Nasscom said. Putting Australians first \nOn April 18, the same day as president Trump\u2019s announcement, Australia abolished its 457 visa , which allowed employers to sponsor skilled foreign talent to work in the country for up to four years . The largest proportion\u2014roughly a quarter\u2014of these visas are held by Indians . This comes a year after the government set limits on which types of occupations that outsiders could apply for under the visa. \n\u201cWe will no longer allow 457 visas to be passports to jobs that could and should go to Australians,\u201d prime minister Malcolm Turnbull announced in a Facebook video . \nAustralia is replacing the 457 visa with two new types of temporary visas\u2014one that lasts two years and another that lasts four. The criteria to acquire these visas are getting tougher: applicants will have to demonstrate previous work experience and a high level of English language proficiency. To make sure that locals get a fair shake, Australia will also mandate labor market testing wherein employers must first attempt to find an Australian citizen or permanent resident for a job role, before hiring an international worker. \nA survey revealed that more than 70% of the 457 visa holders said they planned to apply (pdf) for permanent citizenship. The 90,000 temporary workers currently in the country won\u2019t be affected. Plans for those who had wished to live and work in Australia in the future, however, have been foiled. New Zealand shuts the door \nA day after Australia\u2019s announcement, its next door neighbor New Zealand also blocked foreign workers in a bid to put Kiwis first. \nThe overhaul of the visa program aims to alleviate concerns about housing shortages, road congestion, and overcrowding in major cities, the Guardian reported . \u201cIt\u2019s important that our immigration settings are attracting the right people, with the right skills, to help fill genuine skill shortages and contribute to our growing economy,\u201d immigration minister Michael Woodhouse said. To qualify as high-skilled labor, workers will have to earn at least 150% of the median income. \nThe rising nationalism is going to cost Indians deeply. They have consistently been in among the top three sources of migrants to New Zealand over the last decade, coming in first since 2014. Indians are also the second-largest and fastest-growing international student population in New Zealand but with job prospects dimming due to visa constraints, the trend might come to a halt.

The money was given by Citgo Petroleum, an American subsidiary of Venezuela\u2019s state oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PdVSA). But for all intents and purposes, PdVSA is an arm of the government. \nCitgo, which owns several oil refineries and pipelines in the US, was originally an American company. One of its signs, outside Boston\u2019s Fenway Park, has become a beloved city landmark . Even after PdVSA bought it in the 1980s, the company remained largely independent and preserved its American identity. \nBut since Hugo Ch\u00e1vez took office as president in 1999, the Venezuelan government has been using Citgo to fulfill political goals both domestically and internationally. Under Ch\u00e1vez, the Houston-based company essentially became a cash cow to fund the social programs of his Bolivarian revolution. \nCitgo also provided the fiery populist a platform to upstage US president George W. Bush, whom he famously called a devil, donkey, and \u201cMr Danger.\u201d In 2005, as Bush struggled to respond to the devastation from Hurricane Katrina, Ch\u00e1vez supplied heating oil from Citgo at a discount to poor Americans. Citgo continued the program until recently. \nNow Citgo itself has become politicized. In December, before Trump took office, the Venezuelan government pledged about half of the company\u2019s shares as collateral for a loan from Russian oil firm Rosneft. That has some US politicians worried about what happens if PdVSA defaults on that and other obligations\u2014not unlikely, given Venezuela\u2019s tattered national finances. \n\u201cThis could leave Rosneft, a Russian company controlled by oligarchs with close ties to Vladimir Putin, in control of critical infrastructure in the United States,\u201d reads an April 4 letter (pdf) to US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin sent by several US senators from both parties. \nWith those kinds of concerns, maybe Venezuela thinks that half a million dollars is a small price to pay for having an ally in the White House.

That\u2019s a big part of why Democrats had such high hopes for Ossoff \u2014 that and the fact that Trump\u2019s surprising election and tumultuous presidency so far have energized progressives and other Democrats in a manner that Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy most certainly didn\u2019t. Are they worked up enough to foil and eventually topple Trump? More to the point, are they organized, disciplined and pragmatic enough to turn the passion of marches and street protests into concrete results at the polls? An outright Ossoff victory in Georgia on Tuesday would have been a resounding yes, but the absence of that isn\u2019t a definitive no. It\u2019s a very loud maybe: a question mark in a situation where many partisans and prognosticators itched for an exclamation point. And many dynamics made this an imperfect referendum on Trump\u2019s performance in office and the mood of the electorate. Prime among them: Ossoff, 30, has real shortcomings as a candidate. Although he isn\u2019t necessarily hurt by being a political novice \u2014 voters often welcome fresh faces \u2014 he can come across as callow. He was skewered in negative ads as a lightweight. And he was embarrassed in the home stretch of his campaign by reminders that he isn\u2019t currently residing in the district that he\u2019s seeking to represent. His poise and stamina will be severely tested over the next two months. So will Democrats\u2019 tenacity.

It eludes them still. That\u2019s the takeaway from Tuesday\u2019s special election, which demonstrated anew that Trump\u2019s considerable weakness doesn\u2019t translate automatically and axiomatically into a Democratic advantage. But if Trump thinks that what happened proves his strength , and that the election turned on his tweets against Ossoff in the final days and hours, he\u2019s sorely mistaken and seriously delusional. Not for the first time. And surely not for the last. \n  ,  ", "crawled": "2017-04-20T09:07:16.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-19T21:27:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "85e4b2cb83ccca5b6688e8978d2d098f39c80a43", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 982, "likes": 982}, "gplus": {"shares": 4}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}}, "country": "US", "site": "nytimes.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/frankbruni/index.html?rss=1", "uuid": "85e4b2cb83ccca5b6688e8978d2d098f39c80a43", "section_title": "Frank Bruni", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 9, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxTqL_zg0lpoQSkmIQR6dvqvTEBW2dIihDqnYxn5OtKYhGePE6_zs5PmeYLk8SrvQ5IqAQGVo2CUo-", "domain_rank": 98, "main_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/20/opinion/20bruniWeb/20bruniWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "title_full": "Georgia Didn\u2019t Affirm Trump", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Georgia Didn\u2019t Affirm Trump", "published": "2017-04-19T21:27:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "georgia"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kansas"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "hillary clinton"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "obama"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ossoff"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "trump"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "congressional"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "new york times opinion"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "facebook"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "trump"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxTqL_zg0lpoQSkmIQR6dvqvTEBW2dIihDqnYxn5OtKYhGePE6_zs5PmeYLk8SrvQ5IqAQGVo2CUo-", "author": "FRANK BRUNI", "external_links": [], "title": "Georgia Didn\u2019t Affirm Trump", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Philippines Marcos asks SC to dismiss Robredo's counter-protest (UPDATED) Lawyers of defeated vice presidential candidate Bongbong Marcos stress that Vice President Leni Robredo failed to pay the fee required by the Supreme Court for the recount of ballots Published 1:26   4:03 PM, April 20, 2017 SETTLED. Former senator Bongbong Marcos arrives at the Supreme Court on Monday, April 17, 2017, to post a cash deposit of P36 million as initial payment for his election protest against Vice President Leni Robredo. Photo by Inoue Jaena/Rappler \nMANILA, Philippines (2nd UPDATE) \u2013 Former senator Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr has asked the Supreme Court (SC) to junk the counter-protest of Vice President Leni Robredo, citing her failure to pay a fee in connection with his electoral protest. \nIn an omnibus motion before the High Court on Thursday, April 20, the Marcos camp said Robredo's case should be dismissed since Robredo had failed to settle the first installment of the fee required by the SC, sitting as the Presidential Electoral Tribunal (PET). \nIt cited Rule 34 of the 2010 PET rules, which states, \"If a party fails to make the cash deposits or additional deposits herein required within the prescribed time limit, the Tribunal may dismiss the protest or counter-protest, or take such action as it may deem equitable under the circumstances.\" \nThe PET earlier ordered Marcos and Robredo to settle a fee of P66 million and P15 million, respectively, for the reopening of the ballots for the electoral protest. The sum was based on the number of precincts contested by both parties in their protests. \nMarcos was supposed to pay an initial fee P36 million, while Robredo was to pay P8 million, on Monday, April 17. \nMarcos personally went to the SC on Monday to make the payment. Robredo, for her part, filed a manifestation on April 12, arguing that she should pay the amount only after Marcos' payment and after an initial batch of ballots have been opened to prove the sufficiency of the protest. \nMarcos' lawyers called the other camp's move a \"dilatory\" tactic. \n\"There being no issue as to the cash deposit required to be paid by the protestee/counter-protestant, there is clearly no basis for Robredo to ask this Honorable Tribunal to hold in abeyance the payment of the cash deposit for her counter-protest,\" the motion read. \nMarcos' spokesperson, Vic Rodriguez, said that the protest procedure will be faster if the counter-protest was dismissed. \n\"The only thing left for the Tribunal to do is to hear and decide on the case to be presented by Marcos and no one else. Furthermore, it will exclude them from filing the usual dilatory motions they have been doing,\" said Rodriguez. \nMarcos camp also urged the PET to proceed with the preliminary conference. \nThe preliminary conference is where the issues of a case are simplified and the number of witnesses are set, among other agreements. The proceedings of the case are set in motion when the court issues a preliminary conference order. \nOn January 26 , Marcos asked the PET to set the preliminary conference for his protest that was filed 9 months ago. \nOnly after a preliminary conference can the initial opening of ballots from 3 identified provinces be conducted, said Rodriguez. \nIn a statement released Tuesday afternoon, Robredo's election lawyer, Romulo Macalintal, stressed that they will wait for the PET's resolution on the issues they had raised in their motion. \n\"We will wait for the PET to resolve the matter. If the PET decides we should pay now, we will make the necessary payment,\" said Macalintal.

Sony also shouldered tens of millions of dollars in marketing and had to give MGM a piece of the profit from non-Bond films Sony had in its own pipeline, including \u201c22 Jump Street.\u201d In a 2014 email stolen by hackers and widely published online, Andrew Gumpert, who then oversaw business affairs for Sony, figured that the studio would realize about $38 million in profit if \u201cSpectre\u201d performed as \u201cSkyfall\u201d did. And \u201cSpectre\u201d did not, taking in $881 million, about 20 percent less than \u201cSkyfall,\u201d which was released in 2012. Why, then, do studios want to distribute Bond so badly? Bragging rights, mostly. Having a Bond movie on the schedule guarantees at least one hit in a business where there is almost no sure thing. Bond is gargantuan: The 25 movies have taken in nearly $6 billion at the North American box office, after adjusting for inflation, according to Box Office Mojo. The series has generated billions more in overseas ticket sales, home entertainment revenue, television reruns, marketing partnerships (Omega watches, Aston Martin cars, Gillette razors) and video games. For at least one suitor, Annapurna, landing Bond would be transformative. Ms. Ellison started by focusing on prestige films like \u201cHer\u201d and \u201cAmerican Hustle.\u201d But she has been diversifying toward more commercial movies like the animated hit \u201cSausage Party\u201d and recently hired a senior 20th Century Fox executive to serve as president of her company. Last month, Annapurna signed an unrelated distribution deal with MGM. The person Ms. Ellison and the other bidders need to impress the most is Barbara Broccoli, who runs Eon Productions.

Bragg, with his friend and fellow musician Joe Henry, spent a couple of weeks travelling between Chicago and Los Angeles by train, recording railway-related tunes as they went.\nThe resulting album, Shine a Light (a lyric from the timeless Midnight Special), is a collection rich in tales of personal struggle and redemption, and the songs are realised beautifully on stage. An early highlight of the show is their cover of Jean Ritchie\u2019s The L & N Don\u2019t Stop Here Anymore, a lament for the loss of the Louisville-Nashville line in the tough coal towns of eastern Appalachia.\nIt was written decades ago but it echoes down the ages, as does, for different reasons, In the Pines, the Lead Belly tune perhaps better known to Nirvana fans (and me) as Where Did You Sleep Last Night?\nHenry, who is also a producer of renown with artists such as Aaron Neville and Allen Toussaint, has a broad vocal range to complement Bragg\u2019s more guttural tones. They\u2019re not exactly the Louvin Brothers , whose styling they nick for In the Pines, but it works, such as on the call-and-response version of Rock Island Line.\nMidnight Oil bring scorching set to Sydney pub on a day for the diehards Read more\nThis is no stale, nostalgic run-through of old-timey tunes. As Henry points out, performing and listening to traditional music is important for the same reason people still go to see Shakespeare: it tackles universal themes. Before the musical fetishisation of cars ( thank you and RIP, Chuck Berry ), trains were what gave songwriters the metaphorical means to transport Americans to a better tomorrow, a quest that underpins the country\u2019s restless psyche. Trains were, in essence, a means of escape, Bragg notes, and I defy anyone to listen to these tunes without wishing they were out there riding the trains themselves, listening to those lonesome whistles blowing.\nBut it was perhaps always going to end with a word from one of Bragg\u2019s heroes, Woody Guthrie. His song, Ramblin\u2019 Round, provides the duo with the perfect means to address what they call the \u201cgreat issue of our times\u201d: migration.\n\u201cMy mother prayed that I would be / A man of some renown / But I\u2019m just a refugee / As I go a ramblin\u2019 round,\u201d they sing in the encore, evoking both the romance of Guthrie\u2019s nomadic existence and the possibility that it can all go horribly wrong.

By Matt Fuller , Jonathan Cohn 320 \nWASHINGTON \u2015 GOP moderates and conservatives are nearing a deal on health care that in theory could get the Republican alternative to the Affordable Care Act out of the House and over to the Senate. The changes also might move Republicans even further away from passage \u2015 no one really knows. \nThe deal, brokered between House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Tuesday Group co-chairman Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), would allow states to get waivers eliminating the so-called community rating provision \u2015 the rule that prohibits insurers from charging higher premiums to people with pre-existing conditions. In order to obtain the waiver, states would have to participate in a federal high-risk pool or establish their own, and satisfy some other conditions. \nIn exchange for that conservative concession, the amendment would reinstate the Essential Health Benefits that were already taken out of the bill \u2015 though, again, states could waive those provisions as well if they were able to show that doing so would lower premiums, increase the number of people insured, or \u201cadvance another benefit to the public interest in the state.\u201d \nThat\u2019s according to a white paper describing the amendment, which is the result of weeks of negotiation between Meadows and MacArthur. While they have both agreed to the amendment, supposedly representing a number of conservatives and moderates respectively, the amendment is still being reviewed by the Senate and House GOP leadership. NICHOLAS KAMM via Getty Images \nAdditionally, with Republicans effectively going back on their repeated promises to guarantee coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, the amendment could lose a number of Republicans who already supported the legislation. In short, even though the Tuesday Group and the Freedom Caucus think they have a deal, Republicans writ large might have nothing. \nLeadership is expected to discuss the amendment on a conference call this Saturday with GOP members, but public opinion might also affect the landscape. Republicans are trying to say their amendment will cover people with pre-existing conditions \u2015 because, first, the legislation still claims those people can\u2019t be denied coverage, and second, because there will be high-risk pools for those people if insurance costs dramatically go up for them. \nThe reality, however, is that insurers would be able to effectively deny coverage by pricing sick people out of the market. \n\u201cThis effectively allows states to eliminate the ACA\u2019s guarantee of access to insurance at a reasonable price for people with pre-existing conditions, in the interest of lowering premiums for people who are healthy,\u201d Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, said upon seeing a description of the proposal. \u201cIt seems to tilt heavily towards what the Freedom Caucus has been looking for.\u201d \nRepublicans argue that the high-risk pools would then cover those people, taking them out of the regular insurance pool and lowering prices for everyone else, but high-risk pools have traditionally been underfunded by states and the federal government, resulting in poor coverage and high costs for those who need insurance the most. \nThose concerns may be significant enough that, even with MacArthur\u2019s blessing, the deal does not win over moderates. The concessions also might not be enough for some conservatives, who have expressed issue with Republicans establishing an advance refundable tax credit to help pay for insurance. \nRepublicans need 216 votes to pass their health care bill, and based on statements from GOP members, even with the support of the entire Freedom Caucus for the amendment, there may be enough moderate hold-outs to prevent passage anyway. (MacArthur doesn\u2019t count as a convert; he supported the last bill, albeit reluctantly.) \nThe amendment wouldn\u2019t seem to address the big concerns moderates have expressed \u2015 like raising the cap on how much insurers can charge seniors or cutting $880 billion from Medicaid. These changes are among the reasons that the Congressional Budget Office predicted the House health care legislation would increase the number of people without insurance by 24 million within a decade. \nMany Republicans \u2015 particularly in the Senate \u2015 have said such deep cuts are not acceptable. Just this week, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said he couldn\u2019t support a proposal that jeopardized coverage for the approximately 300,000 people in his state dependent on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion. \nPublic opinion has also shifted since the repeal effort began in earnest \u2015 and it has shifted decisively against Republicans and their cause. The Affordable Care Act is more popular than ever, and in a recent Pew Research Center poll, 54 percent of Americans said they trusted Democrats more than Republicans on health care, while just 35 percent said they trusted Republicans more. That\u2019s the biggest advantage for Democrats on health care since 2009. \nIn short, some leaders in the GOP conference might think they have a deal, but they also might have just found a way to make the bill even more unpalatable for Republicans, thus bringing Congress no closer at all. \nStill, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) suggested that Republicans were getting close to a deal. \u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of negotiating sort of finishing touches,\u201d Ryan said Wednesday during a trip to London. \nSign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

On the hills of Rizal province east of the capital Manila, 340,000 visitors have hit the viewing deck of Pililla town's wind farm since it opened to the public last year, photographing and marveling at its 27 white wind turbines that stand 125 meters (410 feet) high on a 4,500-hectare site.\nWind power is slowly taking off in the Philippines, which faces a huge challenge to find cheaper, cleaner and more efficient ways to power what is one of the world's fastest growing economies and a swelling population of over 100 million people.\nIt's proving a draw for this province and supporting livelihoods too, with 300 people working at the farm and a further 45 making wooden souvenirs of mini turbines the size of hand-held fans.\n\"A lot of people can see the beauty of the Philippines,\" said tourist Christian Lagaja. \"Here, the air is fresh and people are benefiting from the electricity it generates.\"\nWind energy is a work in progress and farms like this produce only a fraction of the country's installed capacity of 20,055 megawatts, which the energy minister recently said needs to double by 2030 to meet demand.\nPower in the Philippines at present is generated 34 percent by coal, 34 percent by oil and gas and 32 percent from renewable sources, among them wind, biomass, hydropower and solar.\n(Reporting by Ronn Bautista; Writing by Martin Petty; Editing by Michael Perry)", "crawled": "2017-04-20T07:32:45.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-20T07:32:45.000+03:00", "uuid": "76bc1ea91bd4307705a20238a803c665284fed16", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 681, "likes": 681}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "yahoo.com", "participants_count": 0, "site_section": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/world/", "uuid": "76bc1ea91bd4307705a20238a803c665284fed16", "section_title": "World | Yahoo News - Latest News &amp; Headlines", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 6, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJxwcPCsnmI8JrI04zQ2vwxGfMXRuGskOOqCy56VCaXKM.UCBNDi3oZiRh3BQ2yiEL_2.YJI8z7FhvasbcoNyNDJbR7CVu7YUzQfY.qWcfN2w-", "domain_rank": 5, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/os/mit/media/m/social/images/social_default_logo-1481777.png", "site_full": "www.yahoo.com", "title_full": "Philippines wind farm generates power, jobs and curious tourists", "spam_score": 0.009, "title": "Philippines wind farm generates power, jobs and curious tourists", "published": "2017-04-20T07:32:45.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "philippines"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "pililla"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "rizal province"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "pililla"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "manila"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "christian lagaja"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "martin petty"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ronn bautista"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "michael perry"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "reuters"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJxwcPCsnmI8JrI04zQ2vwxGfMXRuGskOOqCy56VCaXKM.UCBNDi3oZiRh3BQ2yiEL_2.YJI8z7FhvasbcoNyNDJbR7CVu7YUzQfY.qWcfN2w-", "author": "", "external_links": [], "title": "Philippines wind farm generates power, jobs and curious tourists", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Continue reading the main story \u201cPeople in our office were all fascinated by this college senior who was turning entrepreneurial,\u201d said Joseph Stiglitz , a Nobel laureate economist and Columbia professor who hired Mr. Reider as a research assistant (and booked him to cater a few private dinners for friends). \u201cIt is not the turn I would have thought most of my research assistants taking.\u201d \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Now older and wiser, Mr. Reider is looking to begin his next act. Like so many recent graduates before him, Mr. Reider has moved to Brooklyn, where he has reopened Pith as private-home supper club. It is already fully booked for the month. Brian Mommsen, 31, a hedge fund manager, invited Mr. Reider to live with him and his wife in their new three-story townhouse in the Wallabout neighborhood near the Brooklyn Navy Yard. They\u2019re like \u201cthe rich parents I never had,\u201d Mr. Reider said. He stores his homemade tuiles in the pantry behind their microwave popcorn. Mr. Mommsen and his wife have no children, and Mr. Mommsen hated the idea of wasting the extra space when it could support a project like Pith. Mr. Reider pays nominal rent, and the three operate the supper club cooperatively. They have designed a kitchen and dining space that would be supper-club-ready, with a top-of-the-line grill; a pizza oven and rows of herbs planted in the back garden; pottery by Lily Fein, Mr. Reider\u2019s friend, for serving; and a suite of Hans Wegner Wishbone chairs around the large dining room table. Photo Morels and marrow under a nap of pasta and Pecorino. Credit Nina Westervelt for The New York Times \u201cI haven\u2019t told most of my friends,\u201d Mr. Mommsen said. \u201cThey think I\u2019m nuts already.\u201d As well as giving a young entrepreneur a leg up, Mr. Mommsen envisions the arrangement as a way to engage with the community, and has encouraged Mr. Reider\u2019s desire to involve the neighborhood as well as the Yelp-reviewing, fine-dining adventurers. Beginning next week, Mr. Reider will teach local middle school students to cook through the organization City Growers . The social aspect of dining is important to Mr. Reider as well, and Pith offers the unusual and slightly chaotic promise of a table shared with strangers. Though dinner costs $95 for eight courses (with a $45 optional wine pairing), not unheard-of for New York tasting menus, Mr. Reider is firm that Pith is not a restaurant. (Whether the city health department and the State Liquor Authority licensing board agree remains to be seen, because Pith lacks the permits and liquor license required by law for commercial restaurants.) He is careful to manage people\u2019s expectations. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t come to this supper club and declare that you have allergies at the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s going to really mess me up.\u201d (\u201cMess\u201d was not Mr. Reider\u2019s first choice of verb, dog.) At a preview dinner in early April, he assembled friends and family for the first training-wheels test of a Pith meal from his new kitchen. Guests included Jordan Walters, a former college roommate; Matt FX , the D.J., producer and music supervisor for \u201cBroad City,\u201d with one of his current artists, Synead , the R&B inflected singer-songwriter; and Ian Purkayastha , whose company supplies top New York chefs and Mr. Reider with culinary exotica like truffles, caviar, abalone and whatever else has recently been foraged, caught or farmed. Course after course arrived: velvety spring onion soubise studded with caviar and bitter chickweed, snapper crudo with thin strips of lightly dressed green pepper and the road-tested morels since relieved of the marrow, however dank, and bathed instead in juniper-scented butter, all under a nap of homemade pasta and Pecorino.

The trustees of the school, in Costa Mesa, Calif., said in a statement that they had voted not to enroll new first-year students in the fall but were \u201ccommitted to ensuring that students currently enrolled will have an opportunity to complete their degree in a timely fashion.\u201d The trustees did not set a date for when the school would close. Marc Stevens, a spokesman for the school, which is affiliated with Whittier College, said that officials were exploring ways to allow nearly 400 current students to complete their education but had not yet arrived at a solution. Whittier is the first law school fully accredited by the American Bar Association to announce plans to close. Indiana Tech Law School, in Fort Wayne, which had only provisional accreditation from the bar association, has announced that it will close in June. Other law schools grappling with financial problems have chosen different ways to try to survive. Two law schools in St. Paul, Hamline and William Mitchell, merged in 2015. Charlotte Law School in North Carolina, which the A.B.A. placed on probation in November, has suspended the admission of new students. Thomas M. Cooley Law School, in Lansing, Mich., closed its Ann Arbor campus after enrollment dropped. \n  At Whittier Law School, which opened in 1966 and was accredited in 1978, minority students, many of whom come from California, made up about two-thirds of the student body. Last July, only 22 percent of the school\u2019s graduates passed the California bar exam, according to state data. The employment rate for long-term jobs requiring a legal degree was 29.7 percent among Whittier graduates, according to Law School Transparency, a nonprofit that compiles data on the 205 law schools in the United States.

After a sham accounts scandal, he said, \u201cwe had to fundamentally change how we are organized.\u201d Credit Richard Drew/Associated Press For years, as Wells Fargo secretly set up millions of fake bank and credit card accounts without customers\u2019 consent, the bank\u2019s federal regulator was learning of hundreds of whistle-blower complaints against the company for its sales tactics.\nBut that regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , did not act.\nIn a damning, 15-page report published on Wednesday, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency admitted that its oversight of Wells Fargo was \u201cuntimely and ineffective.\u201d The report said the agency failed to spot clues that would have allowed it to connect the dots in one of the most brazen banking scandals of the recent past.\nSince 2005, Wells Fargo\u2019s board had received regular notifications indicating that \u201cthe highest level\u201d of ethics line complaints and employee firings were related to sales integrity violations, according to the report. It also said that even though the regulating agency started receiving those reports around early 2010, there was no evidence that it adequately followed up on those concerns.\nAnd even after the regulator confronted a Wells Fargo executive in 2010 about 700 cases of whistle-blower complaints, the regulator did not require the bank to provide adequate analysis, according to the report, which was issued by the comptroller\u2019s office of enterprise governance and its ombudsman.\nThe Office of the Comptroller of the Currency recently removed its top Wells Fargo examiner, Bradley Linskens, from a position in which he led 60 regulatory supervisors.\nThe regulating agency\u2019s review follows a similarly harsh report from a panel of Wells Fargo\u2019s board members, published last week, that identified red flags that should have indicated that something was awry years ago. An increasing number of customers seemed to be opening accounts without ever making a deposit, for instance. And as early as 2004, a manager with Wells Fargo\u2019s internal investigations group noticed the so-called sales gaming cases, in which bankers tinkered inappropriately with customer accounts, had risen to about 680 in 2004, from 63 in 2000.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Mr. Sloan said the report offered \u201ca very fair description of John \u2014 it pointed out some of his strengths, and it pointed out some of the mistakes that he made.\u201d\nMs. Tolstedt, who was initially allowed to retire but was later fired, refused to be interviewed by the board\u2019s investigators and disputed the report\u2019s conclusions. Mr. Sloan said he thought the report offered a \u201cfair description of her management style\u201d and added, \u201cMaybe if she had made herself available, the report would have been a bit different.\u201d\nThe federal regulator\u2019s report said that in 2010, the agency asked Ms. Tolstedt about the whistle-blower cases, but she played down the issue, attributing the high volume of cases to a culture that \u201cencourages valid complaints, which are then investigated and appropriately addressed.\u201d", "crawled": "2017-04-20T06:31:15.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-20T06:31:15.000+03:00", "uuid": "cd0f101dce82cef8d27c3aad04bae9d4ff6f2d36", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 772, "likes": 772}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 318}}, "country": "US", "site": "nytimes.com", "participants_count": 0, "site_section": "", "uuid": "cd0f101dce82cef8d27c3aad04bae9d4ff6f2d36", "section_title": "", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 7, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxTqL_zg0lpoRXWEgULuqgeZ7fMlLH1UBFEwgxmHo18gTulrmsU807ZENul.TIBkq1Lue0a5gBtKTWRv_9JewUFG1xpGhFhAEHvv620d8THj2hlYf67oFtOQ--", "domain_rank": 98, "main_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/20/business/20pic-db-oc/20db-occ-facebookJumbo.jpg", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "title_full": "Wells Fargo\u2019s Regulator Admits It Missed Red Flags - The New York Times", "spam_score": 0.057, "title": "Wells Fargo\u2019s Regulator Admits It Missed Red Flags - The New York Times", "published": "2017-04-20T06:31:15.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxTqL_zg0lpoRXWEgULuqgeZ7fMlLH1UBFEwgxmHo18gTulrmsU807ZENul.TIBkq1Lue0a5gBtKTWRv_9JewUFG1xpGhFhAEHvv620d8THj2hlYf67oFtOQ--", "author": "Danielle Ivory", "external_links": [], "title": "Wells Fargo\u2019s Regulator Admits It Missed Red Flags - The New York Times", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Breaking: Waiter Picking Up Napkin With Bare Hand SAN ANTONIO\u2014Watching in horror as he directly handles the dirty, crumpled piece of paper without the aid of a glove or any other sanitary barrier, Sunset Grove Cafe patron Samantha Barnes is at this moment panicking upon noticing that her waiter has picked up her used napkin with his bare hand.

By Nick Visser The New England Patriots visited the White House on Wednesday to celebrate their Super Bowl win alongside President Donald Trump, an annual tradition for the winner of the NFL championship. Well, half of the Patriots did, anyway. Thirty-four Patriots players, plus several staff members and coach Bill Belichick, attended the ceremony on the White House lawn as Trump praised what he called \u201cthe greatest Super Bowl comeback of all time.\u201d The team\u2019s full roster includes 68 players , which means half of the squad skipped the celebration. Super Bowl champion players often miss the annual White House victory visit due to scheduling conflicts. But turnout for Wednesday\u2019s event appeared to be lower than for a previous Patriots visit in 2015. To some players, absences were notably linked to politics. The New York Times first pointed out the stark difference between photographs of the event this year, and those from 2015, the last time the Patriots won the Super Bowl. The earlier photo shows about 120 people, including players and staff, standing behind former President Barack Obama. On Wednesday, there were barely more than 50 people alongside Trump. Patriots' turnout for President Obama in 2015 vs. Patriots' turnout for President Trump today: https://t.co/OxMEOqZonI pic.twitter.com/pLmJWhOw1j \u2014 NYT Sports (@NYTSports) April 19, 2017 The Patriots strongly refuted a Times tweet showing the 2015 and 2017 photographs, saying the comparisons \u201clack context.\u201d The 2015 photo included more than 40 support staff members, who were seated on the lawn this year, the team said. These photos lack context. Facts: In 2015, over 40 football staff were on the stairs. In 2017, they were seated on the South Lawn. https://t.co/iIYtV0hR6Y \u2014 New England Patriots (@Patriots) April 20, 2017 \u201dOnly during the Trump presidency does the media care ... this much about who doesn\u2019t attend,\u201d Patriots spokesman Stacey James told HuffPost. \nOn Thursday, New York Times\u2019 sports editor Jason Stallman apologized for the paper\u2019s tweet, which he called \u201cterrible.\u201d \n\u201cI wish I could say it\u2019s complicated, but no, this one is pretty straightforward: I\u2019m an idiot,\u201d Stallman said in an email to The Washington Post . \u201cIt was my idea, it was my execution, it was my blunder. I made a decision in about four minutes that clearly warranted much more time. \n\u201cOnce we learned more, we tried to fix everything as much as possible as swiftly as possible and as transparently as possible. Of course, at that point the damage was done. I just needed to own it.\u201d Wednesday was the fifth time the team has gone to the White House, James said, and the number of players attending has ranged from about 27 to 50. \u201cHere\u2019s what gripes me \u2015 the scrutiny with which the visit to the White House has been handled by the press,\u201d James said. \u201cNever before have we had players being asked, \u2018Are you going to the White House?\u2019 ... There were only a few players who came out who said they don\u2019t support the president and weren\u2019t going for that reason.\u201d Notably absent Wednesday was Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who canceled at the last minute, citing \u201c personal family matters ,\u201d according to a statement obtained by ESPN. Brady also missed the festivities in 2015, but attended the three previous visits. Trump didn\u2019t mention Brady, but he did call out several players by name, including an awkward moment involving wide receiver Danny Amendola, The Boston Globe reported. Amendola was among those who missed the event. \u201cWhere\u2019s Danny? Where\u2019s Danny?\u201d Trump said. Amendola later thanked the president for the \u201cshout out\u201d in a since-deleted tweet, and said he was attending a funeral. Six other Patriots had announced they wouldn\u2019t attend the event for political reasons. The Globe reported this week that Alan Branch would skip the ceremony because of Trump\u2019s sexist remarks , and \u201cwouldn\u2019t want to spend time away from my family to shake the hand of a guy I wouldn\u2019t want to meet with or talk to.\u201d Defensive back Devin McCourty told Time in February he would stay away, explaining the \u201cbasic reason for me is I don\u2019t feel accepted in the White House.\u201d Trump has personal ties to the Patriots, as various media outlets have reported. Brady had a Make America Great Again hat in his locker for much of the 2016 season, and Trump\u2019s campaign garnered the support of both Belichick and team owner Robert Kraft . Trump responded to the controversy on Thursday with a jab at the Times. Failing @nytimes , which has been calling me wrong for two years, just got caught in a big lie concerning New England Patriots visit to W.H. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 20, 2017 Kraft in February complained about media attention to players\u2019 decisions to skip this year\u2019s celebration, saying it was the first time people cared. \u201cEvery time we\u2019ve had the privilege of going to the White House, a dozen of our players don\u2019t go,\u201d Kraft told the \u201cToday\u201d show. \u201cThis is the first time it\u2019s gotten any media attention. You know, some of the players have the privilege of going in college because they\u2019re on national championship teams, others have family commitments. But this is America. We\u2019re all free to do whatever\u2019s best for us. We\u2019re just privileged to be in a position to be going.\u201d Matt Ferner contributed reporting.

CREDIT: AP Photo/Andrew Harnik On Wednesday, the New England Patriots made their much-anticipated trip to the White House to celebrate their Super Bowl victory. Tom Brady, the legendary quarterback of the Patriots and friend of Trump, announced at the last minute that he wasn\u2019t going to make the trip, citing family matters. He was hardly alone\u200a\u2014\u200aonly 34 Patriots players made the trip to Washington, D.C. The New York Times compared Wednesday\u2019s attendance with the turnout in 2015, and even though the Trump administration isn\u2019t the best with crowd estimates, the difference is stark. Trump, Patriots owner Bob Kraft, and Patriots head coach Bill Belichick all made speeches during the short ceremony, and there were plenty of comparisons drawn between Trump\u2019s presidency and the Patriots\u2019 success on the field. \u201cWith your backs against the wall, and the pundits\u200a\u2014\u200agood old pundits,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBoy, they\u2019re wrong a lot, aren\u2019t they\u200a\u2014\u200a(laughter)\u200a\u2014\u200asaying you couldn\u2019t do it, the game was over, you pulled off the greatest Super Bowl comeback of all time, one of the greatest comebacks of all time\u200a\u2014\u200abut the greatest Super Bowl comeback of all time. And that was just special. I think I looked at odds and they gave you less than one half of 1 percent of winning the game.\u201d The president later added that whether \u201cyou\u2019re trying to win a Super Bowl or rebuild our country, as Coach Belichick would say, there are no days off.\u201d Kraft, who has been incredibly outspoken about his friendship with Trump, took the overcoming odds narrative to the extreme. [E]very time that we have the privilege of coming here to the White House, I think about the long odds that were faced by our country\u2019s forefathers who fought for our freedom and independence. Overcoming long odds through hard work, perseverance, and, most importantly, mental toughness is the foundation of everything that is great about this country. \u2026 This year\u2019s championship was achieved after falling behind by 25 points\u200a\u2014\u200aa deficit so great that in the 97-year history of the NFL\u200a\u2014\u200aover 20,000 games\u200a\u2014\u200athat deficit had only been overcome seven times. In that same year, a very good friend of mine for over 25 years, a man who is mentally tough and hardworking as anybody I know, launched a campaign for the presidency against 16 career politicians, facing odds almost as long as we faced in the fourth quarter. He persevered to become the 45th President of the United States. (Applause.) Seven Patriots, including Brady, had previously announced they would skip the ceremonial White House visit. Running back LeGarrette Blount said he doesn\u2019t \u201cfeel welcome in that house,\u201d a feeling echoed by safety Devin McCourty. Last week, McCourty appeared in a video along with his teammate Chris Long to explain why they weren\u2019t traveling to the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cMy son grows up, and I believe the legacy of our president is going to be what it is, I don\u2019t want him to say, \u2018Hey dad, why did you go when you knew the right thing was to not go?\u2019,\u201d Long said in the video. Chris Long and Devin McCoutry are redefining what it means to \u201cBe Patriots.\u201d thinkprogress.org In his typical off-the-cuff style, Trump offered shoutouts to many of the players who did make the visit, and offered a wholly unnecessary recap of the game as well. The fourth down conversion by Danny Amendola\u200a\u2014\u200awhere\u2019s Danny? Where\u2019s Danny? (Applause.) Way to go, Danny. The big sack by Trey Flowers. Big sack. Where\u2019s Trey? Come on, put your hand up, Trey. See, he\u2019s shy, a little bit. (Applause.) You weren\u2019t shy when you hit that guy, were you? You weren\u2019t shy about\u200a\u2014\u200ahe didn\u2019t mind hitting. Thank you, Trey. Great job. The incredible catch by Julian Edelman. (Applause.) What a catch. We all said, no, that ball was dropped. Isn\u2019t that good? You know, in the old days, they might have said that was dropped. Those replays are good. You\u2019re starting to like the replay, right? (Laughter.) Great going, Julian. Trump also shared the behind-the-scenes story of the famous (infamous?) letter Belichick sent him during the campaign that he read the day before election day. (You know, the one that Belichick insisted wasn\u2019t an endorsement.) Apparently Trump gave Belichick a heads up that he was going to read his letter aloud in a \u201cvery big and important state,\u201d and Belichick actually rewrote his letter to be even more flattering of Trump. And just a quick story about the coach. So I had won the primaries, and I\u2019m now in this rather heated election that a few of you have read about. And he wrote me this beautiful letter after the primaries. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d he said all sorts of things that were really good. I mean, it was really a beautiful letter. And it was very close to going before the election. And I called up, and I said, Coach, do you mind if I read the letter tonight to a stadium full of people in a very, very big and important state? And he said, \u201cYou know what? I\u2019d rather not have you do that. Could you send it back to me? I\u2019m going to give you another one.\u201d I said, no that\u2019s okay. \u201cNope, I want to give you another one.\u201d Now, immediately to me, that means he\u2019s going to tone it down because what he said was so nice.

He also called the landmark nuclear deal in 2015 a failure and accused Tehran of following in the footsteps of North Korea.\nTillerson\u2019s remarks contrasted with a letter he wrote to the speaker of the House of Representatives, Paul Ryan, on Tuesday in which he confirmed Iran was upholding its commitments under the deal, known as the joint comprehensive plan of action (JCPOA).\nZarif, a close ally of Iran\u2019s president, Hassan Rouhani, tweeted: \nIn a statement released a few hours later, Zarif accused the US of attempting to distract attention away from its \u201cabysmal\u201d human rights record, in particular Donald Trump\u2019s attempted ban on immigrants from certain Muslim-majority countries and America\u2019s support for Israel, which Zarif claimed has an \u201cillegal\u201d nuclear arsenal.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad-Zarif. Photograph: Vyacheslav Oseledko/AFP/Getty Images \nTillerson\u2019s accusations of Iranian provocation come amid an increasingly bitter row between the US and North Korea. On Thursday, North Korean state media warned the US of a \u201csuper-mighty preemptive strike\u201d after Tillerson said on Wednesday he was \u201creviewing all the status of North Korea, both in terms of state sponsorship of terrorism as well as the other ways in which we can bring pressure on the regime in Pyongyang\u201d. \nThe Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the North\u2019s ruling Workers\u2019 party, said: \u201cIn the case of our super-mighty preemptive strike being launched, it will completely and immediately wipe out not only US imperialists\u2019 invasion forces in South Korea and its surrounding areas but the US mainland and reduce them to ashes.\u201d \nTillerson said \u201can unchecked Iran has the potential to travel the same path as North Korea\u201d and that the nuclear deal had failed to prevent Tehran from developing nuclear weapons in the future.\n\u201cIt only delays their goal of becoming a nuclear state\u201d, he said. \u201cThe Trump administration has no intention of passing the buck to a future administration on Iran.\u201d\nTillerson said it was a mistake that \u201cother serious threats that Iran poses\u201d were ignored in the nuclear negotiations in 2015. Trump has previously criticised his predecessor, Barack Obama, for what he termed a disastrous deal. He promised to dismantle it, but he has yet to take concrete steps to do so.\nThe Iran nuclear deal is a success \u2013 and the whole world is safer for it | Federica Mogherini Read more \nUnder the agreement struck in Vienna in 2015, Iran rolled back its nuclear programme, reducing its stockpile of enriched uranium and removing thousands of centrifuges and the core of the heavy water reactor in Arak.\nIn return, the US and EU ended all related economic sanctions on Iran in January 2016 after the UN nuclear agency confirmed the country had fulfilled its obligations. According to the International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s latest assessment, Iran is still keeping to its commitments, but Tehran complains that it has not been able to fully reconnect to the global banking system.\nAll eyes are now on whether Trump will sign waivers to extend sanctions relief in mid-May, an important moment that would determine his administration\u2019s real commitment to the deal.\nAnalysts believe he will not scrap the deal, but will instead adopt a more rigorous implementation of the agreement and tighten sanctions already in place. This could force Iran to violate first or make the deal redundant.\nThe National Iranian American Council (NIAC), which supports the deal, said Tillerson\u2019s remarks were incendiary. \u201cPublic statements lambasting the nuclear deal with Iran as a \u2018failed approach\u2019 and comparing the country with North Korea are reckless and blatantly false,\u201d the group said.\n\u201cThis comes just one day after Secretary Tillerson acknowledged that Iran was complying with the terms of the nuclear deal. Such ambivalent policy positions have come to define this administration.\u201d\nTillerson said in his 18 April letter to Ryan that Trump had directed a review of JCPOA to establish whether suspending sanctions on Iran was vital to US national security interests. His comments a day later implied that the review was not limited to the nuclear deal and would include Washington\u2019s overall Iran policy.\nThe NIAC said Tillerson\u2019s remarks amounted to a \u201can extreme departure\u201d from the views shared by the US\u2019s traditional allies, such as France, Germany and Britain, and that they would play into the hands of hardliners in Iran, who adamantly oppose their moderate counterparts who negotiated the deal.\n\u201cSecretary Tillerson followed these remarks by saying that the Trump administration will not \u2018pass the buck\u2019 of a nuclear Iran to the next administration,\u201d the NIAC said.\n\u201cThere is little room to interpret this statement as anything less than a proclamation of the Trump administration\u2019s intent to scrap the nuclear deal and reset the United States on a path to war.\u201d\nTillerson\u2019s comments about Iran as a disruptive force in the region came as he praised Saudi Arabia on the day that the US defence secretary, James Mattis, was visiting Riyadh. Mattis echoed Tillerson in the Saudi capital, speaking about Iran\u2019s \u201cdestablising\u201d influence, particularly in Yemen.\n\u201cIran is the world\u2019s leading state sponsor of terrorism and is responsible for intensifying multiple conflicts and undermining US interests in countries such as Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon, and continuing to support attacks against Israel,\u201d Tillerson said.\nThe US has backed Saudi Arabia in its military intervention in Yemen, which aims to reinstate the ousted president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, and counter the advances of Houthi rebels, which it claims are backed militarily by Iran. Tehran vehemently denies the charge.\nMatt Duss, a foreign policy adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders, tweeted:\nTopics Iran's nuclear programme Nuclear weapons US foreign policy Trump administration Rex Tillerson Iran news   Share   Reuse this content", "crawled": "2017-04-20T05:26:09.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-20T05:26:09.000+03:00", "uuid": "45f0713d753f88237319b3794cc63bf3d1c7ad49", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 528, "likes": 528}, "gplus": {"shares": 2}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}}, "country": "US", "site": "theguardian.com", "participants_count": 0, "site_section": "", "uuid": "45f0713d753f88237319b3794cc63bf3d1c7ad49", "section_title": "", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 5, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nmFR93hfFGTKsyFq_MOLWqIqBpvrL150KE1JWGRwuhPZGKlqX8u60VKdD1MbNE2iYm53GncbtPzioHsrLIdfmJmpYItAvaxMIpROPE3IqyZeSC5Z8Mmc0G6q6NMGM3IQk", "domain_rank": 170, "main_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e939c10c9b2f6b4e3d3dd699253f610fb1eed654/0_193_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft&amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&amp;s=c58a9173da3ffd6300817ef765ef06d3", "site_full": "www.theguardian.com", "title_full": "Iran nuclear deal: Rex Tillerson accuses Tehran of 'alarming provocations' | World news | The Guardian", "spam_score": 0.369, "title": "Iran nuclear deal: Rex Tillerson accuses Tehran of 'alarming provocations' | World news | The Guardian", "published": "2017-04-20T05:26:09.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "iran"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "us"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "tehran"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "united states"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "syria"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "washington"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "north korea"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "middle east"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "lebanon"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "saudi arabia"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "u.s."}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "iraq"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "yemen"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "rex tillerson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "barack obama"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "tillerson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ayatollah khamenei"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "donald trump"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "obama"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "james mattis"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "federica mogherini"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "frederica mogherini"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "trump"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "paul ryan"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "congress"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "us house of representatives"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "iran"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "european union"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "trump"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nmFR93hfFGTKsyFq_MOLWqIqBpvrL150KE1JWGRwuhPZGKlqX8u60VKdD1MbNE2iYm53GncbtPzioHsrLIdfmJmpYItAvaxMIpROPE3IqyZeSC5Z8Mmc0G6q6NMGM3IQk", "author": "", "external_links": [], "title": "Iran nuclear deal: Rex Tillerson accuses Tehran of 'alarming provocations' | World news | The Guardian", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Culture Editor at ThinkProgress. jgoldstein@thinkprogress.org Apr 19 Ivanka\u2019s business in China is nothing to worry about, according to Ivanka Business as (un)usual from the first daughter.

In fact, the AP reports that 2017 has brought Ivanka\u2019s company record sales: \u201cU.S. imports, almost all from China, shot up an estimated 166 percent last year.\u201d Ivanka formally stepped down from managing her company in mid-January, but she still owns and profits from it. In a statement, an Ivanka Trump brand spokesperson said that \u201call 2017 Chinese trademarks were defensive, filed to prevent counterfeiters or squatters from using her name.\u201d From the AP: Using the prestige of government service to build a brand is not illegal. But criminal conflict-of-interest law prohibits federal officials, like Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, from participating in government matters that could impact their own financial interest or that of their spouses. Some argue that the more her business broadens its scope, the more it threatens to encroach on the ability of two trusted advisers to deliver credible counsel to the president on core issues like trade, intellectual property and the value of Chinese currency. Controversy has swirled around Ivanka\u2019s use of her father\u2019s\u200a\u2014\u200aand, now, her own\u2014 political platform for her financial gain ever since Donald Trump first announced his candidacy for presidency. She wore dresses from her eponymous brand to the Republican National Convention, boosting sales of both sheaths; on her official website, she posted photos from the event with captions that included links to where readers could buy her outfits.

(The less expensive model costs $8,800.) And when news broke that Nordstrom would be dropping Ivanka\u2019s line\u200a\u2014\u200athe official comment on the matter was the decision was made due to falling sales, not political pressure\u200a\u2014\u200a President Trump weighed in on Twitter to decry what he deemed to be Nordstrom\u2019s \u201cunfair\u201d and \u201cterrible\u201d treatment of his daughter. Counselor to President Trump Kellyanne Conway, in what scanned to ethics experts everywhere as an obvious violation of federal law, went on Fox & Friends and told viewers to \u201cgo buy Ivanka\u2019s stuff\u201d and that she was giving Ivanka a \u201cfree commercial.\u201d thinkprogress.org Matters like this are even more fraught now that Ivanka is a White House employee.

Bill O\u2019Reilly is out at Fox News after 21 years. Credit: AP Photo Of all the racists, Islamophobes, misogynists, homophobes, and all-around hateful bigots ThinkProgress has chronicled since our inception 11 years ago, none have provided such a steady stream of nonsense as William James O\u2019Reilly Jr. And so it is with mixed emotions that we must report the premature and yet also long-overdue demise of Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s career. It was 42 years old. Goodnight, sweet prince. thinkprogress.org O\u2019Reilly\u2019s career came into this world on local television, where he quickly earned a reputation as an irritable showman. A job offer from the syndicated television gossip program Inside Edition provided O\u2019Reilly\u2019s career with a bridge from local nuisance to national embarrassment in the early 1990's. But it was at Fox News Channel, then a fledgling cable news network developing an obsession with Bill Clinton\u2019s libido, that O\u2019Reilly\u2019s star was born. In the face of overwhelming evidence, O\u2019Reilly always remained steadfast in his insistence that children never go to bed hungry , that voter ID laws aren\u2019t deliberately punitive toward minority communities , and that global warming is a fiction. Even when guests came to his Manhattan studio armed with indisputable facts, they were no match for O\u2019Reilly\u2019s unshakable opposition to accuracy . He was nothing if not generous with his platform though, lending his airwaves to such friends as Ann Coulter and anti-immigrant birther Lou Dobbs , and his longtime producer Jesse Watters, who was strategically deployed to carry out the show\u2019s more straightforwardly racist segments , like the one he filmed just last year making fun of Asian-Americans . It was Watters who, in 2009 after ThinkProgress reported on O\u2019Reilly\u2019s comments that women should expect to be raped if they don\u2019t dress appropriately, was sent to stalk Amanda Terkel \u2014then a ThinkProgress editor\u2014while she was on vacation.

The Orlando-based company said the orca \u2014 the last in a generation of whales bred in confinement \u2014 was born Wednesday afternoon. SeaWorld did not immediately name the calf because the park's veterinarians had not yet determined whether it was male or female.\nThe mother, 25-year-old Takara, was already pregnant when SeaWorld announced in March 2016 that it had stopped breeding its orcas. The gestation period for orcas is about 18 months.\nPreparing late last month for the moment, SeaWorld's chief zoological officer, Chris Dold, told The Associated Press he expected the birth to be bittersweet, because it would be the last such event at any of the parks. But just hours after the calf was born about 3:30 p.m. EDT Wednesday, Dold said, SeaWorld staff only felt like celebrating. SeaWorld said mother and calf both appear healthy.\n\"These are extraordinary moments,\" he said by phone while traveling to the U.S. from Abu Dhabi, where SeaWorld is developing its first new park without orcas. \"It's a tempered celebration only because we're focused on the health of these guys.\"\nSeaWorld decided to stop breeding orcas, and phase out its world-famous killer whale performances by 2019, after public opinion turned against keeping orcas, dolphins and other animals in captivity for entertainment. The backlash intensified after the 2013 release of \"Blackfish,\" a documentary critical of SeaWorld's orca care. It focused on the orca Tilikum, which killed trainer Dawn Brancheau in Orlando in 2010, dragging her into the pool before shocked visitors after a \"Dine with Shamu\" show.\nTilikum, which sired 14 calves over nearly 25 years in Orlando, died of bacterial pneumonia in January.\nRelated:\nFor more news videos visit Yahoo View , available now on iOS and Android .\nThe newborn calf was sired by Kyuquot (pronounced ky YOO kit) at the San Antonio park by natural means. It brings SeaWorld's orca population in the U.S. to 23. All the orcas are expected to remain on display and available for researchers for years to come in Orlando, San Diego and San Antonio.\nSeaWorld has said it plans to introduce new \"natural orca encounters\" in place of theatrical shows. This summer, the San Diego park will unveil a new, educational attraction in a revamped pool, and new orca attractions eventually will follow in San Antonio and Orlando.\nThe calf will be visible to visitors either in the orca stadium pool at the San Antonio park or in two adjacent pools. Observations about the calf and Takara by SeaWorld trainers will be provided from the moment of birth to researchers trying to fill gaps in their data about wild killer whales.\nDold said veterinarians at the San Antonio park told him the calf was born normally \u2014 tail first \u2014 after about an hour and a half of smooth labor. Both orcas were swimming calmly, including taking breaths at the water's surface, and trainers would be watching for the calf to begin nursing.\n\"Mom generally will rest but she can't rest too much .... mom's not holding onto the calf, but it's riding in her slipstream, and that's how it gets around,\" Dold said. \"Our expectation is that all of this will go smoothly, but we take none of that for granted.\"\nBirth control and \"social management\" will prevent future orca pregnancies, said spokeswoman Suzanne Pelisson Beasley. SeaWorld has not collected a wild orca in nearly 40 years, and most of its orcas were born in captivity.\nResearchers have said they worry that SeaWorld's decision to stop breeding orcas will slowly reduce their ability to study orca health, growth and behavior, limiting them in coming years to collecting data from a small pod of aging whales.\nHeather Hill, a St. Mary's University comparative psychologist who plans to monitor the sleeping habits of Takara and the calf over the coming year, said it was frustrating to see research opportunities at SeaWorld undermined by public opinion amid federal cuts to science funding.\n\"This will be one of the first times we'll be able to see not just a mother with a newborn calf but also a newborn calf with siblings,\" Hill said.\nThis is Takara's fifth calf. Two of her other offspring remain at the San Antonio park, while one lives at SeaWorld Orlando and another has been loaned to a park in Tenerife, Spain. SeaWorld has no current plans to separate Takara and the newborn in the future, or to move any of its other orcas, Dold said.\nIn March, Dold said SeaWorld remains committed to orca research and conservation, calling the last orca birth in captivity \"a solemn reminder of how things can change and how things can be lost.\"", "crawled": "2017-04-20T05:18:48.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-20T05:18:48.000+03:00", "uuid": "98af1a21ae3b0428e9fbe7bd272619f7ffb18cbf", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 769, "likes": 769}, "gplus": {"shares": 6}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "yahoo.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/world/", "uuid": "98af1a21ae3b0428e9fbe7bd272619f7ffb18cbf", "section_title": "World | Yahoo News - Latest News &amp; Headlines", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 7, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJ19wCh2kDbm7T3.cI599EgXXaUoqbc8zbKzTDgAVn5EXl84FFcm6u4Dev9qQ1mVfebzPyN6I2_bvaCsUnXUAc2MXz8xPjUd3y", "domain_rank": 5, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VrjaW5JTWyR.1MJyjO3vfg--/aD0yMTgxO3c9Mjg4NDtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/d2d1c18a87e546c4ba756ea37d25a661.jpg", "site_full": "www.yahoo.com", "title_full": "APNewsBreak: Baby orca!

Security Council sanctions.\nThe Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the North's ruling Workers' Party, did not mince its words.\n\"In the case of our super-mighty preemptive strike being launched, it will completely and immediately wipe out not only U.S. imperialists' invasion forces in South Korea and its surrounding areas but the U.S. mainland and reduce them to ashes,\" it said.\nReclusive North Korea regularly threatens to destroy Japan, South Korea and the United States and has shown no let-up in its belligerence after a failed missile test on Sunday, a day after putting on a huge display of missiles at a parade in Pyongyang.\n\"We're reviewing all the status of North Korea, both in terms of state sponsorship of terrorism as well as the other ways in which we can bring pressure on the regime in Pyongyang to re-engage with us, but re-engage with us on a different footing than past talks have been held,\" Tillerson told reporters in Washington on Wednesday.\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence, on a tour of Asian allies, has said repeatedly an \"era of strategic patience\" with North Korea is over.\nRelated:\nFor more news videos visit Yahoo View , available now on iOS and Android .\nU.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said during a visit to London the military option must be part of the pressure brought to bear.\n\"Allowing this dictator to have that kind of power is not something that civilised nations can allow to happen,\" he said in reference to Kim.\nRyan said he was encouraged by the results of efforts to work with China to reduce tension, but that it was unacceptable North Korea might be able to strike allies with nuclear weapons.\nNorth and South Korea are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.\n'MAX THUNDER'\nSouth Korea's acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, at a meeting with top officials on Thursday, repeatedly called for the military and security ministries to maintain vigilance.\nThe defence ministry said U.S. and South Korean air forces were conducting an annual training exercise, codenamed Max Thunder, until April 28. North Korea routinely labels such exercises preparations for invasion.\n\"We are conducting a practical and more intensive exercise than ever,\" South Korean pilot Lieutenant Colonel Lee Bum-chul told reporters. \"Through this exercise, I am sure we can deter war and remove our enemy's intention to provoke us.\"\nSouth Korean presidential candidates clashed on Wednesday night in a debate over the planned deployment in South Korea of a U.S.-supplied Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system, which has angered China.\nFrontrunner Moon Jae-in was criticised for leaving his options open before the May 9 election.\nOn Monday, Hwang and Pence reaffirmed their plans to go ahead with the THAAD, but the decision will be up to the next South Korean president. For its part, China says the system's powerful radar is a threat to its security.\nThe North has said it has developed a missile that can strike the mainland United States, but officials and experts believe it is some time away from mastering the necessary technology, including miniaturising a nuclear warhead.\nRUSSIA, U.S. AT ODDS\nThe United States and Russia clashed at the United Nations on Wednesday over a U.S.-drafted Security Council statement to condemn North Korea's latest failed ballistic missile test.\nDiplomats said China had agreed to the statement.\nSuch statements by the 15-member council have to be agreed by consensus.\nPrevious statements denouncing missile launches \"welcomed efforts by council members, as well as other states, to facilitate a peaceful and comprehensive solution through dialogue\". The latest draft statement dropped \"through dialogue\" and Russia requested it be included again.\n\"When we requested to restore the agreed language that was of political importance and expressed commitment to continue to work on the draft ... the U.S. delegation without providing any explanations cancelled the work on the draft,\" the Russian U.N. mission said in a statement.\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China believed in the Security Council maintaining unity.\n\"Speaking with one voice is extremely important to the Security Council appropriately responding to the relevant issue on the peninsula,\" he told reporters.\nThere has been some confusion over the whereabouts of a U.S. aircraft carrier group after Trump said last week he had sent an \"armada\" as a warning to North Korea, even as the ships were still far from Korean waters.\nThe U.S. military's Pacific Command explained that the USS Carl Vinson strike group first had to complete a shorter-than-planned period of training with Australia. It was now heading for the Western Pacific as ordered, it said.\nChina's influential Global Times newspaper, which is published by the People's Daily, the Communist Party's official paper, wondered whether the misdirection was deliberate.\n\"The truth seems to be that the U.S. military and president jointly created fake news and it is without doubt a rare scandal in U.S. history, which will be bound to cripple Trump's and U.S. dignity,\" it said.\n(Additional reporting by Lesley Wroughton in WASHINGTON, William James in LONDON, Michelle Nichols at the UNITED NATIONS, Idrees Ali in RIYADH, Ben Blanchard in BEIJING and Kim Do-gyun in GUNSAN, South Korea;

US NAVY PHOTO / MCS 3RD CLASS MATT BROWN \nWASHINGTON, United States \u2014 The Trump administration on Wednesday tried to clear the waters after it gave confusing messages concerning the whereabouts of a US supercarrier that supposedly was steaming toward North Korea last week. \nAmid soaring tensions ahead of North Korea\u2019s apparent ramping up for a sixth nuclear test, the US Navy on April 8 said it was directing a naval strike group headed by the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier to \u201csail north\u201d from the waters off Singapore, as a \u201cprudent measure\u201d to deter Pyongyang. \n\u201cWe are sending an armada. Very powerful,\u201d were the words of President Donald Trump, and other officials made it sound like the ships were plowing toward the region. ADVERTISEMENT \n\u201cA carrier group steaming into an area like that, the forward presence of that is clearly\u2026 a huge deterrent. So, I think it serves multiple capabilities,\u201d White House spokesman Sean Spicer said April 11. \nPentagon chief Jim Mattis said the Vinson was \u201con her way up\u201d to the region. \nBut the Navy on Tuesday admitted the ships were in fact sent in the opposite direction \u2014 away from Singapore and toward Australia to conduct drills with the Australian navy. \nDefense officials said the Vinson wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near North Korea before next week at the earliest \u2014 it is thousands of nautical miles from the Java Sea where the ship was located over the weekend to the Sea of Japan. \nCritics pounced on the discrepancy as a dangerous miscommunication, saying it fed into North Korea\u2019s narrative that America is all bluster and doesn\u2019t follow through on threats. \u2018It is happening\u2019 \nIt also comes as the White House faces ongoing credibility issues on a broad range of topics including the size of Trump\u2019s inaugural crowd, his unsubstantiated claim that he was \u201cwiretapped\u201d by the Obama administration and his unsupported assertion millions of votes in November\u2019s election were illegal. \n\u201cThe president said that we have an armada going towards the peninsula. That\u2019s a fact. It happened. It is happening, rather,\u201d Spicer said Wednesday as he tried to clarify the issue. ADVERTISEMENT \nSpeaking to reporters in Saudi Arabia, Mattis said the Pentagon had tried to be open about the Vinson\u2019s whereabouts. \n\u201cWe generally don\u2019t give out ship schedules in advance but I did not want to play a game either and say we were not changing the schedule when in fact we have,\u201d he said. \n\u201cShe will be on her way. I will determine when she gets there and where she actually operates, but the Vinson is going to be part of our ensuring that we stand by our allies in the northwest Pacific.\u201d \nRear Admiral Jim Kilby, who heads the Vinson strike group, wrote on Facebook late Tuesday that the ships\u2019 deployment \u201chas been extended 30 days to provide a persistent presence in the waters off the Korean Peninsula.\u201d \nJames Faeh, a former Pentagon country director for Korea during the Obama administration, said the Vinson deployment was not a make-or-break development, given that the United States already has a massive array of military hardware and tens of thousands of troops in the region to deter Pyongyang. \nHe told AFP the rhetoric coming from the Trump administration on North Korea was \u201coverheated and risky,\u201d but the strike group\u2019s deployment was \u201cnot at all outside of the mainstream.\u201d \nNorth Korea staged a massive military parade on Saturday and observers widely expected the country to conduct a sixth nuclear test to coincide with celebrations marking the birthdate of regime founder Kim Il-Sung. \nBut that test hasn\u2019t happened yet, though North Korean leader Kim Jong-un attempted to launch a missile Sunday that the Pentagon said blew up almost immediately after launch.

(Photo: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for Victoria\u2019s Secret) More Caitlyn Jenner is spilling all the (alleged) tea in her upcoming memoir, and her ex-wife Kris Jenner isn\u2019t having it. In a clip for Sunday\u2019s Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Kris vents to daughters Khlo\u00e9 and Kim after reading an advanced copy of The Secrets of My Life .\n\u201cI read it, and basically the only nice thing she had to say was that I was great socially at a party one time,\u201d Kris, who was married to Bruce for 22 years, tells her daughters. \u201cNone of it makes sense. Everything she says is all made up. Why does everything have to be that Kris is such a b**** and an a**hole?\u201d\nIt\u2019s been about two years since the gold medal-winning Olympian publicly transitioned from Bruce to Caitlyn. Since then, one of the biggest points of contention between Kris and Caitlyn has been over when Kris knew about her former husband\u2019s gender identity struggle. That is brought up again in Caitlyn\u2019s book.\n\u201cI was curious and said, \u2018What the hell is going on?\u2019\u201d Kris, 61, reflects on pressing Bruce years ago. \u201cShe said, \u2018You just would never understand.\u2019 And then, all through the book, Kris knew. \u2018Kris knew before I even made love to her.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018What?\u2019\u201d\nThat\u2019s not all Caitlyn has to say about their intimate life. In an excerpt obtained by People , she describes the sex as \u201cimbued with love\u201d but admits she wasn\u2019t \u201centirely comfortable\u201d with the act.\nView photos\nBruce and Kris Jenner were married for 22 years. (Photo: Beck Starr/FilmMagic) More \u201cWe fall in love quickly (we marry after seven months),\u201d Caitlyn writes . \u201cSince \u2014 let\u2019s not kid ourselves \u2014 everyone wants to know, Kris and I have good and frequent sex at the beginning.\u201d\nShe continues, \u201cI tell Kris about my gender issues before I make love to her. This will always be a subject of dispute between us. She insists that she was taken by surprise by my ultimate transition to Caitlyn, which obviously means in her mind that she did not know enough.\u201d\nCaitlyn, 67, adds she dressed as a woman a number of times in front of Kris.\nAll that info apparently is enough for Kris to be \u201cdone\u201d with Caitlyn. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so angry and disappointed in someone in my whole life,\u201d Kris says on Sunday\u2019s Keeping Up . \u201cI\u2019m not going to be used as a person who benefits someone else\u2019s life just to make them look better.

The vessels are part of the Russian Navy's Pacific Fleet. \n\"I'm assuring you that we will do everything to make this port call a significant contribution to the strengthening of our friendship and cooperation between our two nations in the interest of security and stablity in the region,\" Captain Alexsei Ulyaneko of the Russian Navy said in a press briefing on Thursday. HEAVILY ARMED. Varyag is armed with 16 anti-ship missiles. \nThe goodwill visit comes a month before President Rodrigo Duterte's scheduled visit to Moscow in a bid to expand defense ties with new countries. He said he seeks to forge a foreign policy that is independent of the country's longtime treaty ally, the US. (READ: Duterte to fly to Russia on May 25 ) \nCaptain Leo Ramon Miado of the Philippine Navy said they look forward to training with their Russian counterparts. \"This is a training opportunity for us. We can view the advanced equipment of the Russian Navy in line with our modernization effort,\" he said. \nIn January, Russian anti-submarine ship Admiral Tributs visited Manila.

[1] The series is a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle, epitomized by its family of the same name: Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield, named for the town in Oregon [11] ; however, the state the show takes place in is never revealed (this is one of the show\u2019s running gags). The show parodies American culture, society, television and many aspects of the human condition. History \nThe family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with the producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19th, 1987. After a three-season run, the cartoon was developed into a half-hour primetime show and was an early hit for FOX , becoming the network\u2019s first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989\u20131990). [1] Reception \nSince its debut on December 17th, 1989, the show has broadcast over 600 episodes; the twenty-eight season started airing on September 25th, 2016. The Simpsons is the longest-running American sitcom, the longest-running American animated program, and in 2009 it surpassed Gunsmoke as the longest-running American primetime, scripted television series. The Simpsons Movie , a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on July 26 and July 27th, 2007, and grossed over $527 million. \nThe Simpsons has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 27 Primetime Emmy Awards, 27 Annie Awards and a Peabody Award. Time Magazine\u2019s December 31st, 1999 issue named it the 20th century\u2019s best television series, and on January 14th, 2000 the Simpson family was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Homer\u2019s exclamatory catchphrase \u201cD\u2019oh!\u201d has been adopted into the English language, while The Simpsons has influenced many adult-oriented animated sitcoms. Online Presence \nThe Simpsons also has a robust online presence. The Simpsons Facebook page currently has more than 66.2 million likes. [13] Launched on August 13th, 2012, The Simpsons twitter account, @The Simpsons, currently has over 884,000 followers. On May 15th, 2016, the show fielded questions via Twitter to be incorporated into a live segment of the show, in which Homer answered questions in real time. [12] Simpsons World \nOn October 21st, 2014, Fox\u2019s cable network FX launched \u201cSimpsons World,\u201d allowing FX subscribers to stream every episode to stream every episode of the show via their FXNow App. Early in its release, fans criticized \u201cSimpsons World\u201d for not presenting the show in the proper aspect ratios and the time and length of commercial breaks, which altered the content of the show. FX eventually updated the app, giving users the option to view in their original aspect ratio. [1] Fandom \nSince the show is so ubiquitous, its fandom is not internet-based, although it is so large that it does has a significant online presence. The show has been around since the internet started becoming widely public in the early \u201990s, so its influence has been consistently felt throughout the history of the internet. \nThere are several Simpsons fan sites around the internet, but the majority of the online presence of the show is thanks to the frequent use of catchphrases, image macros, and YouTube clips. Frinkiac \nOn February 2nd, 2016, web developers Paul Kehrer, Sean Schultz, and Allie Young launched the Frinkiac, [14] a massive database of every shot and line from seasons 1 through 17 of the show. The site allows users to type in quotes and pinpoint the scene it comes from. They can then make memes or gifs based on the line. Newsweek said, \u201cIt may be the greatest feat of Internet engineering we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d [15] Impact \nThroughout its history, The Simpsons has been on the forefront of American pop culture, thanks to its witty writing and fearless parodying of current events and politics, as well as its consistent references to contemporary and historical pop culture and cult icons (such as Charles Bronson). The show has garnered controversy, brought to a head when in 1992 the then-US president George H. W. Bush remarked \u201c[we want] to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons.\u201d Arguably, this only increased interest in the show. The Simpsons has become an icon of American culture, and has had a lasting impact on society over its long run; many of its neologisms (such as D\u2019oh!, meh, yoink!, and crap-tacular) [1] and catchphrases are frequently used on- and off-line, and its characters are easily recognized all over the world. Related Memes \u201cMilhouse Is Not A Meme\u201d \nMilhouse is not a meme is a paradoxical statement and a well-known debate on the imageboard site 4chan about what constitutes an internet meme and what doesn\u2019t. The meme uses an image of the character Milhouse Van Houten, who in and of himself is not a meme \u2013 that is to say, Milhouse is not a meme, but \u201cMilhouse is not a meme\u201d is, in fact, a meme. Chalkboard Gag Parodies \nChalkboard Gag Parodies are a series of exploitable images based on the perennial chalkboard gag scene from The Simpsons \u2019 opening sequence. In the scene, Bart is seen repeatedly writing a message on a large chalkboard, as a form of punishment. In each episode, the text is changed, and is frequently a joke or pun. The exploitable is a natural extension of this, with users adding their own text. The Goggles Do Nothing! \nThe Goggles Do Nothing! is a catchphrase used for conveying the horror of having seen something unwanted, another way of saying \u201ccannot unsee.\u201d The quote was used in the Season 7 episode \u201cRadioactive Man,\u201d in which Rainier Wolfcastle, playing the action hero Radioactive Man, is doused with sulfuric acid while being protected only by a pair of goggles. As the acid eats through he clothes, he screams \u201cMy eyes! The goggles do nothing!\u201d Redundant Adjectives are Redundant! \n*(X) (Y) is is a common sentence structure derived from a scene in the Season 11 episode \u201cThe Grift of the Magi,\u201d in which Ralph excitedly says \u201cfun toys are fun!\u201d Use of the phrase online started with 4chan; it is often used to place a humorous emphasis on redundancy. Popular examples include \u201cLongcat is l ng\u201d, \u201cSuccessful troll is successful\u201d and \u201cOld pic is old.\u201d It has become a common phrase across the imageboards and the internet in general. I Must Go \nI Must Go, My People/Planet Need(s) Me is a caption frequently used on image macros showing people or animals jumping or flying away. The phrase originated in the Season 8 episode \u201cThe Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show,\u201d in which a character (Poochie), voiced by Homer, and introduced into the long-running cartoon \u201cItchy & Scratchy,\u201d is killed off. The caption first attained spread through demotivational posters \", and has since spread to other image macros. Stupid Sexy Flanders \nStupid Sexy Flanders is a phrase that comes from the Season 11 episode \u201cLittle Big Mom,\u201d spoken by Homer as he tries to think about what an skiing instructor said, but instead can\u2019t get the image of Flanders\u2019 skintight ski suit out of his mind. It has a similar usage on forums to \u201ccannot unsee,\u201d although it is generally used in situations where the viewer is secretly enthralled by the supposedly undesirable object, as opposed to being outright disgusted. It is also frequently used in YouTube parodies of the scene. I, For One, Welcome Our New X Overlords \nI, For One, Welcome Our New X Overlords - is a catchphrase from the Season 5 episode \u201cDeep Space Homer.\u201d It is spoken by news anchor Kent Brockman after he sees a video, transmitted from Homer\u2019s space mission, that shows ants flying around in the cabin of the spacecraft; the ants appear super-sized because they are close to the lens, which spooks Kent. The phrase is commonly used to comment facetiously on someone\u2019s or something\u2019s perceived control of a situation, and is one of the oldest and most well-established Simpsons -related memes. That\u2019s The Joke. \nThat\u2019s the Joke is a catchphrase originating from the Season 6 episode \u201cA Star is Burns.\u201d In it, Rainier Wolfcastle is being interviewed about his new stand-up comedy movie, and a clip is shown (see below). In the clip, Wolfcastle says \u201cDid you ever notice how men always leave the toilet seat up? [\u2026] That\u2019s the joke.\u201d The catchprase, often accompanied by an image of Wolfcastle looking serious in front of the brick wall (again, see above), is used to condescendingly explain the punchline of a joke, or is itself the punchline to an otherwise-unfunny remark. That\u2019s a Paddlin\u2019 \nThat\u2019s a Paddlin\u2019 (or X? That\u2019s a Paddlin\u2019) is a catchphrase/copypasta from the Season 6 episode \u201cThe PTA Disbands,\u201d in which local resident Jasper Beardly takes over teaching 2nd Grade at Springfield Elementary. He uses the phrase when outlining his classroom policies; for example, \u201cTalking out of turn? That\u2019s a paddlin\u2019.\u201d In the show, the phrase was intended to comment on the antiquated notion of corporal punishment in public schools, but online it has come to be used as a joke about authority and strange rules. The phrase is also used in various other snowclones, and the action of \u201cPaddlin\u2019\u201d has come to be associated with Jasper\u2019s image. Dental Plan / Lisa Needs Braces \nDental Plan / Lisa Needs Braces is a call-and-response template that peaked in popularity on 4chan in 2008. It originates from the Season 4 episode \u201cLast Exit to Springfield,\u201d in which Homer hears the words \u201cDental Plan\u201d (spoken by Lenny) and \u201cLisa Needs Braces\u201d (spoken by Marge) repeatedly in his head while his brain tries to connect the loss of his dental insurance with his having to pay out-of-pocket for Lisa\u2019s braces. Its online use is mostly related to the phrase\u2019s extremely repetitive and catchy nature; it is frequently used as an interruptor, either by repeating the phrase, or by repeating captioned images. The phrase has also been used in various YouTube remixes. Do It For Her \nDo It For Her is a photoshop meme originating from the Season 6 episode \u201cAnd Maggie Makes Three.\u201d The original image shows a placard in Homer\u2019s office reading \u201cDON\u2019T FORGET , YOU\u2019RE HERE FOREVER \u201d, over which Homer has plastered images of Maggie, so it reads \u201cDO IT FOR HER \u201d, referring to how he returned to his job in order to support her future. The meme usually involves photoshopping images of other characters in place of Maggie, such as Hatsune Miku . What a Time to be Alive \n\u201c*What a Time to be Alive*\u201d/memes/what-a-time-to-be-alive is a memorable quote from the animated television series The Simpsons which can be used to sarcastically express awe at a very minor technological advance, or alternatively, disapprove something that is without a precedence, similar to the use of the phrase \u201cI don\u2019t want to live on this planet anymore\u201d. Old Man Yells at Cloud \nOld Man Yells At Cloud is an exploitable image of a gag headline featured in a 2002 episode of The Simpsons . On the Internet, the newspaper clip of Abe Simpson angrily raising his fist under the literal headline \u201cOld Man Yells at Cloud\u201d has been repurposed into a series of reaction images for commentaries on various topics based on the phrasal template (X) Yells at (Y). Now Do Classical Gas \nNow Do Classical Gas is a quote from The Simpsons character Lenny in the episode \u201cLast Exit to Springfield.\u201d In the scene, Lenny asks Lisa, who is playing acoustic guitar, to play the piece \u201cClassical Gas\u201d by Mason Williams. [1] The scene became the subject of YouTube Poop remix videos popular on the Facebook page Simpsons Shitposting in early 2017. The Simpsons Did It \nThe Simpsons Did It is catchphrase used to call out an idea widely perceived as original or new that may have been already portrayed in an episode of the long-running American animated TV sitcom The Simpsons . Online, it is typically uttered by fans of the TV show to point out odd similarities between an emerging trend, or a current event in the news, and a plot point from a previously aired episode of The Simpsons , whether by coincidence or intention. Bart\u2019s Testing Megaphones \nBart\u2019s Testing Megaphones refers to a series of video remixes of a clip from_ The Simpsons_ in which Bart Simpson uses a series of megaphones to prank the town of Springfield. Bootleg Bart \nBootleg Bart refers to original unauthorized merchandise and/or original or contemporary fan art created with the image of Bart Simpson, often mutated or badly drawn, or sometimes with the character represented as a different ethnicity. While originally created to capitalize on fandom for the original character, the bootleg version now has a clear fan base of its own. Marge Krumping \nMarge Krumping , also known as \u201cMarge Dance,\u201d is a photoshop meme based on an exploitable still shot of The Simpsons character Marge Simpson trying to krump, a style of hip hop dance characterized by highly energetic and expressive movement of one\u2019s head and the limbs. Home Backs Into Things \nHomer Backs Into Things is a reaction GIF taken from a scene in the animated comedy series The Simpsons in which the main character, Homer Simpson, steps back into a hedge until he is no longer visible. The GIF is used to express embarrassment, and has been frequently edited so Simpson disappears into other things. That\u2019s What We Wanted You To Think \nThat\u2019s What We Wanted You To Think is a memorable quote from a scene in the animated sitcom The Simpsons in which a Russian ambassador reveals that the collapse of the Soviet Union was an elaborate ruse.

No, it\u2019s the children who are wrong.\u201d The comic is typically used as a reaction image on image boards and discussion forums to express a disconnect with contemporary youth a culture. Just Give \u2019Em One of These \nJust Give \u2019Em One of These is a quote from a memorable scene in the American animated sitcom The Simpsons , in which the character Moe Szyslak teaches a class on how to defend oneself with dances moves. The scene has inspired several remixes where other songs are played over his dance. Search Interest \nSearch interest in The Simpsons peaked in 2007, coinciding with the release of The Simpsons Movie .

Any such request is likely to draw attention because Exxon\u2019s former chief executive, Rex Tillerson, is now U.S. secretary of state. \nExxon spokesman Alan Jeffers said the company does not comment on ongoing discussions with regulators. But he pointed out that it has in the past been granted permission from Treasury to keep intact Exxon\u2019s joint venture with Rosneft, despite the sanctions. \nDuring at least three occasions in 2015 and 2016, Exxon was granted licenses allowing \u201climited administrative actions\u201d in Russia, according to annual shareholder disclosures. \nThe United States and European Union imposed economic sanctions on Russia over its annexation of the Crimea region in 2014 and role in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. \nTexas-based Exxon, the world\u2019s largest publicly traded oil producer, wound down drilling in Russia\u2019s Arctic in 2014 after those sanctions were imposed. Exxon was allowed to finish some drilling projects as the sanctions took effect. \nExxon and Rosneft in 2012 had unveiled an offshore exploration partnership with plans to invest as much as $500 billion in developing Russia\u2019s vast energy reserves in the Arctic and Black seas. \nAny request from Exxon to expand its business in Russia is bound to draw scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers investigating possible ties between some campaign aides of U.S. President Donald Trump and Moscow. \nSome Republicans in Congress, as well as some European allies, are also anxious about any sign that the Trump administration might ease some of the sanctions imposed on Russia. \nTillerson was confirmed by the U.S. Senate as Secretary of State in February, and has promised to recuse himself from matters related to Exxon for a year.

By 2020, depression may be second only to heart disease as the leading cause of healthy years of life lost. Why is depression so common? Well it\u2019s said, \u201cNothing in Biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.\u201d But why would we evolve to get depressed? \nDepression presents a baffling evolutionary puzzle. Despite its negative effects, it remains common and heritable, meaning a large part of the risk is passed through our genes. Presumably, there must be some kind of adaptive benefit or it would have been naturally selected against. Could depression be an evolutionary strategy to provide a defense against infection? \nInfection has been the leading cause of mortality throughout human history, making it a critical force in natural selection. Indeed, because of infections, our average life expectancy before the industrial period was only 25 years, and it was not uncommon for half of our children to die without reaching adulthood. \nWhen we become infected , there is a surge of inflammation as our body mounts a counter attack. Our body responds by feeling lousy, sick, weak, tired, and slow. We don\u2019t want to socialize. The only thing we do want to do is sleep. These symptoms are similar to the ones we experience during depression and are great for fighting infection. Slowing down not only helps us conserve energy to put up a good fight, it also reduces social contact so we don\u2019t infect others. We see this protective phenomenon in other social animals, like honeybees and mole rats, who feel compelled to crawl off and die alone to reduce the risk of infecting the rest of their community. Humans have even evolved to think poop and decaying flesh don\u2019t smell good to keep us safe from infection. \nTo explore the relationship between inflammation and mental health, we have to look back to 1887, when this connection was first noted by Dr. Julius Wagner-Jauregg, the only psychiatrist to ever win the Nobel Prize. What evidence have we accumulated in the past century that inflammation causes depression? We know that people who are depressed have raised inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein and that inflammatory illnesses are associated with greater rates of major depression. Indeed, we find depression in even more benign inflammatory conditions such as asthma and allergies. This is important as it suggests that the mood symptoms may be directly tied to the inflammation and are not simply the result of \u201cfeeling bad about having a terrible disease.\u201d \nWe also know that you can induce depression by inducing inflammation. For example, when we give interferon for certain cancers or chronic infection, up to 50 percent of people go on to suffer major depression. Even just giving a vaccine can cause enough inflammation to trigger depressive symptoms. Taken together, these studies \u201care strongly suggestive of inflammation being a causative factor of mood symptoms.\u201d \nCan an anti-inflammatory diet help prevent depression? We didn\u2019t know until researchers followed the diets of about 43,000 women without depression for approximately 12 years. Those who ate a more inflammatory diet, characterized by more soda, refined grains and meat, became depressed. \u201cThis finding suggests that chronic inflammation may underlie the association between diet and depression.\u201d \nNormally, we think of omega-3s as anti-inflammatory, but researchers found fish to be pro -inflammatory, associated with increased C-reactive protein levels. This is consistent with recent findings that omega-3s don\u2019t seem to help with either depression or inflammation. As I discuss in my video, the most anti-inflammatory diet is a plant-based diet, which is capable of cutting C-reactive protein levels by an impressive 30 percent within two weeks, perhaps because of the anti-inflammatory properties of the antioxidants found in plants. \nWhen free radicals cause oxidative damage, it may cause an autoimmune response in the body by changing the chemical structures of otherwise ubiquitous molecules to generate new structures that the body attacks as foreign. For example, when LDL cholesterol gets oxidized, our body creates antibodies against it that attack it. Likewise, clinical depression can be accompanied by increased oxidative stress and the autoimmune inflammatory responses it creates. Free radicals may thus lead to autoimmune inflammation. \nIn health, \nMichael Greger, M.D. \nPS: If you haven\u2019t yet, you can subscribe to my free videos here and watch my live, year-in-review presentations\u20142015: Food as Medicine: Preventing and Treating the Most Dreaded Diseases with Diet , and my latest, 2016: How Not to Die: The Role of Diet in Preventing, Arresting, and Reversing Our Top 15 Killers. \nRelated:", "crawled": "2017-04-20T03:56:25.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-19T23:00:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "100fe6ffd9028f248470c1e963ae4a7856be2fa0", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 759, "likes": 759}, "gplus": {"shares": 4}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "care2.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.care2.com/feeds/greenliving/healthy-home.rss", "uuid": "100fe6ffd9028f248470c1e963ae4a7856be2fa0", "section_title": "Care2 Healthy Living \u00bb Health", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 7, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ndk_fL43BMrVltDWFoR2tHCXpgAmb4Mt_9bwrmrM.aaso8.tijME4BFgv35b.utvmY3EqANrJOjTeE0ayGCLrte36CzqZl.MeChSrrh5Nbw--", "domain_rank": 4841, "main_image": "http://dingo.care2.com/pictures/greenliving/1404/1403301.large.jpg", "site_full": "www.care2.com", "title_full": "Can an Anti-Inflammatory Diet Help Depression?", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Can an Anti-Inflammatory Diet Help Depression?", "published": "2017-04-19T23:00:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [{"sentiment": "neutral", "name": "michael follow michael"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "julius wagner-jauregg"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "michael greger"}], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.ndk_fL43BMrVltDWFoR2tHCXpgAmb4Mt_9bwrmrM.aaso8.tijME4BFgv35b.utvmY3EqANrJOjTeE0ayGCLrte36CzqZl.MeChSrrh5Nbw--", "author": "Dr. Michael Greger", "external_links": [], "title": "Can an Anti-Inflammatory Diet Help Depression?", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Community PRC results: April 2017 midwife licensure exam 965 out of 2,194 passed the Midwife Licensure Examination given by the Board of Midwifery this April 2017 Published 5:28 PM, April 18, 2017 Updated 5:28 PM, April 18, 2017 \nThis is an announcement from the PRC \nMANILA, Philippines \u2013 The Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) announced on Tuesday, April 18 that 965 out of 2,194 passed the Midwife Licensure Examination given by the Board of Midwifery in the cities of Manila, Baguio, Cagayan de Oro, Cebu, Davao, Iloilo, Legazpi, Pagadian, Tacloban, Tuguegarao and Zamboanga this April 2017. \nThe members of the Board of Midwifery who gave the licensure examination are Dr. Alejandro R.

That suspicion seems to align with what WikiLeaks said in their press release announcing the Vault 7 release on March 7. \n\u201cThe archive appears to have been circulated among former US government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive,\u201d the pro-transparency group said . \nUnnamed US intelligence sources told Reuters within a day of the release that the CIA had been anticipating it since near the end of 2016. \nThe FBI and CIA coordinated reviews of the incident and a criminal investigation was opened within a day of the release, the Washington Post reported at the time, based on an unnamed former intelligence official who said to expect \"another major mole hunt.\" \nFormer CIA Deputy Director Mike Morell told CBS News less than a week after the release that the leak \u201chas to be an inside job,\u201d as the data was on a CIA top secret network \u201cnot connected to any other network.\u201d What makes this look real?Program & office names, such as the JQJ (IOC) crypt series, are real.

On Wednesday, five days after being acquitted in that case, he was found hanged in his prison cell. Credit Pool photo by Pat Greenhouse In 2012, when he was 22 years old, Aaron Hernandez signed a record $40 million contract with the New England Patriots . Only five years earlier, Hernandez had been working menial jobs in his hardscrabble hometown Bristol, Conn., where he drove through fading neighborhoods in a $300 used car he had bought with money borrowed from friends.\nThat was before Hernandez racked up scoring records in high school and rocketed to the University of Florida as a top recruit. It was before he became a collegiate All-American, and then the youngest player in the N.F.L. and finally a rising star on the most successful professional football team of the century.\nOn the day he signed his new contract, a gleeful, proud Hernandez said he was \u201cset for life, a good life.\u201d\nYet 10 months later, in 2013, with the discovery of the body of a friend who had been shot multiple times, his life began a dramatic spiral downward.\nContinue reading the main story He would be convicted of the friend\u2019s murder, would be accused and acquitted of two other killings from 2012 and would become a vivid, ready example of out-of-control off-field behavior by N.F.L. players.\n On Wednesday, just five days after his acquittal and on the day his former team celebrated its recent Super Bowl victory at the White House, Hernandez, 27, hanged himself in the prison where he was serving a life sentence.\nGuards at the Souza Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley, Mass., found that Hernandez had hanged himself with a bedsheet attached to a cell window around 3 a.m., the Massachusetts Department of Correction said in a statement. He had also attempted to block the door to his cell.\nHernandez was housed in a single cell in the general prison population, the statement said, and a spokesman added that officials had not had a reason to believe he was a suicide risk, a sentiment echoed by Hernandez\u2019s lawyer. No note was found.\nFor the past several years, mystery and paradox shrouded the life of Aaron Hernandez, an oft-smiling cog of three Patriots teams who nonetheless never escaped the deleterious effects of his unruly, irregular roots.\nPatriots Coach Bill Belichick, when asked on CNBC last week to sum up Hernandez in a single word, replied:\n\u201cTragedy.\u201d\nAsked if Hernandez\u2019s fate \u2014 at the time, life in prison \u2014 was also heartbreaking, Belichick responded: \u201cYes. That would be another word.\u201d\nPhoto Hernandez in 2012. After signing a record $40 million contract with the Patriots that year, he said was \u201cset for life, a good life.\u201d Credit Barton Silverman/The New York Times The Patriots cut Hernandez from the roster shortly after his arrest and a spokesman for the team said Wednesday it would have no comment on his death.\nSome fans found the twists of his life, and news of his death, shocking.\nDawn McCarthy, 53, a nurse who happened to be visiting Boston from her \u2014 and Hernandez\u2019s \u2014 hometown of Bristol, wiped away a tear as she recalled watching Hernandez play in high school, admiring the \u201cpositive attributes he had before he took a sad turn.\u201d\nAs a teenager, she said, \u201che influenced a lot of students and people hoping to be good football players.\u201d McCarthy added that she had avoided media coverage of his murder trials. \u201cIt was just a painful thing to watch, read about.\u201d\n Mike Pouncey, a teammate of Hernandez\u2019s at Florida who is now with the Miami Dolphins, wrote on Instagram: \u201cTo my friend my brother! Through thick and thin right or wrong we never left each other\u2019s side. Today my heart hurts as I got the worse news I could have imagined.\u201d\nThroughout the many turns of Hernandez\u2019s life \u2014 a story of success that was frequently tinged with attendant failure \u2014 there were only a few constants. One was that Hernandez seemed to live in two worlds. Whether he was leading Florida to a national championship or playing in the white-hot spotlight of the Super Bowl in 2012, his inner circle of friends included small-time ne\u2019er-do-wells he knew from the old neighborhood.\nHis Bristol associates were with him when he was involved in a bar fight in Florida in 2007 \u2014 his first publicized brush with the police \u2014 and they were with him six years later in the rented car that drove to the Massachusetts industrial park where the body of his friend Odin Lloyd was found shot six times.\n Growing up in the 1990s, Hernandez was known mainly as the athletically gifted, if mischievous, son of Dennis Hernandez, a decorated sports star at the University of Connecticut. Dennis Hernandez was a custodian in Bristol, but around the city he was known as the King.\nThe elder Hernandez kept a tight rein on Aaron and his older brother Dennis, who was known as D. J. Both Hernandez brothers were renowned for their muscular physiques, competitiveness and talent at football and basketball.\nBut Aaron, who set Connecticut high school pass receiving records, was often seen with a rough-and-tumble crowd \u2014 a matter that worried his father because it might dissuade college recruiters. But his friends and family said that Aaron\u2019s transgressions were largely minor and that he was largely protected within the community, which understood that he was on his way to greater stardom.\nBut in 2006, Dennis Hernandez died from complications following hernia surgery. Aaron\u2019s mother told local reporters that she was concerned that Aaron might lose the direction in his life that his father had provided.\nPhoto Hernandez (81) celebrating with his teammates in 2008 after defeating top-ranked Alabama in the SEC championship game. Credit Dave Martin/Associated Press Shortly thereafter, halfway through his senior year at Bristol Central High School, Aaron left for Florida, where he was permitted to complete his remaining high school classes and was swiftly integrated into the football program.\nAs a freshman at Florida, while still 17, Hernandez got into a fight with a bouncer at a bar. He received deferred prosecution after being charged as a juvenile. In the fall of that year, according to The Orlando Sentinel, Hernandez was questioned by the police about a shooting that injured two men. Friends from Connecticut were with Hernandez that night, The Sentinel reported.\n Hernandez was briefly suspended as a sophomore for an undisclosed violation of team rules and by his junior year he acknowledged testing positive for marijuana. He decided to skip his senior year and enter the N.F.L. draft. Florida Coach Urban Meyer told N.F.L. coaches that Hernandez had been rehabilitated and that Meyer himself had led him in daily Bible study sessions.\nHernandez was widely considered the best tight end available in the 2010 draft. He wrote some teams a personal letter to explain his missteps, but few were swayed. He fell to the Patriots in the fourth round, and most viewed him as a risky pick.\nBut initially he was a worthwhile gamble.\nThat season, at 20 years old, Hernandez was the youngest player on an N.F.L. roster. He was immediately productive for the Patriots and apparently stayed out of trouble. With Tom Brady throwing him passes, he was a steady presence and a key contributor in the team\u2019s run to the Super Bowl in 2012. But on a team of high-profile stars, Hernandez was always viewed as a loner.\nThe Patriots\u2019 owner, Robert K. Kraft, nonetheless awarded Hernandez an extravagant new contract in 2012, extending his pact with the team by five years and $40 million, which was at the time a record for a tight end and the second-biggest contract extension in N.F.L. history.\nAt a news conference, Hernandez appeared humbled. He talked of having been nurtured by \u201cthe Patriots\u2019 way.\u201d And he donated $50,000 to a charity of Kraft\u2019s.\nKraft called Hernandez\u2019s gesture \u201ca touching moment.\u201d Roughly a year later, after Hernandez was arrested on suspicion of Lloyd\u2019s murder, Kraft told The Boston Globe, \u201cI\u2019ve been duped, and our whole organization has been duped.\u201d\nHernandez and Lloyd, two men who had almost nothing in common other than football, had come together entirely by happenstance in 2013. Lloyd, a 27-year-old semiprofessional football player, began dating the sister of Hernandez\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Shayanna Jenkins. The two men began socializing together. That June, at a Boston nightclub, Hernandez became angry with people Lloyd was talking with. Investigators said that Hernandez might have suspected that Lloyd was talking with them about the double murder case in which Hernandez was ultimately acquitted.\nAlthough no murder weapon was found, and no witness to the shooting of Lloyd came forward, prosecutors built a case tying Hernandez to the killing.\nNow, under the quirks of an archaic legal doctrine used in Massachusetts, Hernandez will most likely get something he and his lawyers had fought for. His conviction is expected to be vacated by a court because of his death.", "crawled": "2017-04-20T03:18:28.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-20T03:10:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "d5d5eefb64b6a56170a9b4c3e2e61520b160ac65", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 668, "likes": 668}, "gplus": {"shares": 5}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 5}}, "country": "US", "site": "nytimes.com", "participants_count": 0, "site_section": "", "uuid": "d5d5eefb64b6a56170a9b4c3e2e61520b160ac65", "section_title": "", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 6, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxTqL_zg0lpoRMIrl7d76pKzxLuMZKkSqroNt_DFD6adravk8ECW.MXhMwhg5DRIS9VPCrAcL_kPofybaiw.hRwehb07KPfcTb", "domain_rank": 98, "main_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/20/sports/20pennington3/20pennington3-facebookJumbo.jpg", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "title_full": "The Final Fall of Aaron Hernandez - The New York Times", "spam_score": 0.153, "title": "The Final Fall of Aaron Hernandez - The New York Times", "published": "2017-04-20T03:10:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxTqL_zg0lpoRMIrl7d76pKzxLuMZKkSqroNt_DFD6adravk8ECW.MXhMwhg5DRIS9VPCrAcL_kPofybaiw.hRwehb07KPfcTb", "author": "Bill Pennington", "external_links": [], "title": "The Final Fall of Aaron Hernandez - The New York Times", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Who's winning, who's losing, and why. April 19 2017 8:04 PM The Mysterious Case of the Wayward Aircraft Carrier This is a dangerous way for the world\u2019s most powerful military to operate. The USS Carl Vinson in the South China Sea on April 8. Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Matt Brown/U.S. Navy via Getty Images \nThere is a sobering reality beyond this week\u2019s strange \u201cWhere\u2019s Waldo?\u201d story of the USS Carl Vinson and its strike group: For a period of time, significant confusion existed as to the location of a U.S. aircraft carrier strike group, one of the most potent weapons in the American arsenal, at a moment of high tension on the Korean Peninsula. \nAlthough not (yet) a major crisis, this incident portends deep problems with the White House, its chain of command, and its approach to national security. At best, The Vinson episode suggests policy gaps between the president and his top military advisers over how to act toward North Korea. Worse, it appears the president has not firmly established control over the chain of command\u2014or that he possibly overdelegated authority to his generals and admirals. Further, this incident sends deeply disturbing signals to allies and adversaries regarding the president\u2019s control over the military and the credibility of his statements, diluting the deterrent value of American words and actions. Advertisement \nLet\u2019s start with two fundamental premises of U.S. civil-military relations. First, the president is the elected commander in chief of the military; short of declaring war, he has the power to order military deployments and operations, and be held politically accountable for them. Second, the president ought to know with accuracy the locations and readiness of major U.S. military assets, and have the ability to command those forces as needed to protect the country. \nAny departure from these norms stands out as potentially threatening to national security. When, in 2007, the Air Force lost track of nuclear weapons and inadvertently allowed them to fly over the continental United States mounted on a bomber, then\u2013Defense Secretary Robert Gates rightfully saw the incident as an abomination and fired the Air Force leadership. Get Slate in your inbox. \nIn the case of the Vinson , any movement toward similar accountability starts in a complete muddle. Did President Trump and Press Secretary Sean Spicer deliberately mislead the public with their statements about the carrier\u2019s whereabouts? Were they misinformed by the Pentagon? Or were they carelessly freelancing with their comments to be more bellicose toward Korea? Any of these scenarios is fraught with peril; all depart from established norms of civil-military relations that dictate the president speak with authority and accuracy about the military forces he commands. It\u2019s also unclear who, exactly, ordered the Vinson and its battle group to steam toward North Korea, let alone whether that was fully coordinated with the Pentagon or other parts of the government. \nOne possibility is that U.S. Pacific Command, led by Adm. Harry Harris, ordered the Vinson maneuvers to create options for the White House in anticipation of a tougher policy on Korea. The sequence of events bears this out, given that Harris\u2019 announcement preceded any notice from the White House or Pentagon, suggesting there was little coordination in advance. This accords with the general hawkishness of Pacific Command on issues relating to China and North Korea\u2014hawkishness which differed greatly from the Obama administration. This scenario would align with President Trump\u2019s recent aloofness toward his role in the chain of command, as well as the preferences of top advisers like Steve Bannon and H.R. McMaster, who, respectively, want to \u201c de-operationalize \u201d the National Security Council and implement a \u201c mission command \u201d style of direction for the military. The recent delegation of authority to commanders overseeing the Afghanistan war\u2014who, in turn, decided to drop the \u201cMassive Ordnance Air Blast\u201d bomb in ISIS fighters near the Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan border\u2014fits this pattern as well. Advertisement \nA second possibility is that the Trump administration, perhaps led by Defense Secretary James Mattis, ordered the carrier move. If so, this does not represent a civil-military relations problem per se; ordering around aircraft carriers is unquestionably a presidential prerogative. However, it does highlight weaknesses in the White House\u2019s competence and expertise in the use of military force. The disconnects between the White House and Pentagon statements suggest a lack of close coordination, much less any substantive follow-up such as complementary movement of air and ground forces. (Although troop movements are generally kept classified, significant moves like these are hard to conceal, and they are often publicized because there is greater deterrent value in making such moves openly.) This lack of coordination isn\u2019t helped by the unfilled appointments throughout the Trump administration, nor the infancy of the administration itself, which makes the whole enterprise function as something less than a \u201c fine-tuned machine .\u201d In Moscow and Beijing, President Trump\u2019s word now carries less force. \nSimilarly, it\u2019s unclear whether McMaster or Mattis fully played out the scenario surrounding the Vinson \u2019s dispatch and the potential commitment of two other carriers to the waters near Korea. Sending three carriers to the Western Pacific deprives the Navy\u2014with its 11 total carriers\u2014of the ability to rotate carriers through other missions, including support for the actual wars being fought in Iraq/Syria and Afghanistan. Just as the Army and Marines surged in Iraq and Afghanistan during tough fighting periods, so too can the Navy surge its carrier groups in a crisis\u2014but it cannot maintain this posture indefinitely. And although President Trump pledged to build a larger Navy during the campaign, he can\u2019t build one overnight, or possibly even during his presidency . Trump\u2019s impulsive and seemingly uncoordinated commitment of a carrier here could constrain his options for years to come. \nThe Vinson episode also illustrates, once again, how questions about the president\u2019s truthfulness can have adverse strategic consequences. Our friends and allies, including South Korea , can hardly take comfort in knowing the American cavalry is coming when the administration speaks so cavalierly. Conversely, America\u2019s adversaries listen to every presidential word\u2014whether he wants to be taken literally or not. They also check those words against their intelligence, gathered via their own satellites, spies, and other means. The Russians and Chinese watch the Vinson \u2019s movements closely and surely noticed the gap between the statements from Pacific Command, the Pentagon, and the White House. Bluffing works in statecraft, but only when your opponent can\u2019t see your cards. In Moscow and Beijing, President Trump\u2019s word now carries less force because he has devalued it by making statements that are demonstrably untrue about the deployment of American military forces. Top Comment \nThis is from Kevin D Williamson, A right wing Writer at National Review: Every day, the incoherence deepens: He\u2019s going to cover \u201ceveryone,\u201d but he\u2019s going to push 24 million people off their health insurance. More... Join In \nIf the current tension with North Korea resolves on its own, the curious case of the wayward carrier may not matter much. But if we are indeed headed for a major crisis like the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis or the 1994 showdown with North Korea over nukes, then it matters greatly that the White House, Pentagon, and Pacific Command are marching to the beats of separate drummers. Imagine if, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the military had inadvertently moved forces in Europe to create options for the Kennedy administration or otherwise signaled hostile intent to the Soviets. That crisis might have ended far differently, with potentially catastrophic consequences. \nThe presidency\u2019s national security responsibilities are too complex to be handled like a family real-estate business or reality television show . President Trump and his advisers need to communicate much more clearly with each other, and he must personally exercise greater control over the forces he commands, or else his presidency (and possibly the world ) will end in disaster. \nPhillip Carter is a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and adjunct professor of law at Georgetown University.

Informal egg roll parties were recorded at the White House during the early Lincoln administration.\nDuring the post-Civil War years, the Easter egg games were played on the grounds surrounding the U.S. Capitol Building. In 1876, an act of Congress outlawed the Capitol grounds and terraces from being used as playgrounds to protect the property from destruction. In 1878, President Rutherford B. Hayes officially opened the White House grounds to local children for egg rolling on Easter Monday.\nDuring World War I and II, the events were canceled. Dwight D. Eisenhower and First Lady Mamie Eisenhower revived the event in 1953 after a 12-year absence. In 1969, Pat Nixon's staff introduced the White House Easter Bunny, a staffer dressed in a white fleece bunny costume who roamed the grounds and welcomed the egg rollers and posed for photographs. By 1974 the activities evolved into organized egg-rolling races. The 1981 eggstravaganza included assorted clowns and characters, balloon vendors, Broadway show vignettes, a petting zoo, exhibits of antique cars, and an eggxposition of specially decorated eggs (one for each state). Each egg roller received a goody bag filled with a program, toy products supplied by corporate sponsors, and food- whose wrappers littered the lawn. Since 1987 the event's theme has been inscripted on each egg, and by 1989 George and Barbara Bush added their facsimile signatures. Today the official eggs are given one to a child (under 12) as they leave the South Lawn.\nRead More About Easter in Washington, DC\nRelated Articles Washington, DC's 2017 Major Annual Events Celebrating Easter in Washington, DC Easter in the United States Explore the White House Gardens on a Public Tour Fun Easter Egg Hunts Near Washington, DC Learn About Washington DC's Pro Sports Teams Our Expert Recommends Spring Family Fun in the DC Area 15 Best Places to Go with Kids in the DC Area Top 10 Things to Do in the DC Area Easter Brunch in Washington, DC Spring Break in Washington, DC National Cherry Blossom Festival Best Museums for Kids in Washington DC April Festivals and Events in Washington DC May Festivals and Events in Washington DC Washington, Holidays/Seasonal Events White House Easter Egg Roll 2017: Tickets, Talent & More ", "crawled": "2017-04-20T03:12:12.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "1f2d528bdb0c20250350c92846e7a6c6b95bc386", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 984, "likes": 984}, "gplus": {"shares": 26}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 9}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}}, "country": "US", "site": "about.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://dc.about.com/", "uuid": "1f2d528bdb0c20250350c92846e7a6c6b95bc386", "section_title": "Washington DC Travel - A Guide to the DC Capital Region", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 9, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Ue2ovhVfnF1D9SA__6_49aESrlmlLkYjVFgLwjWaJU97RWzDU4xovAr9XMnmFcEsGNjbEvIG7_twFiHo7v_kLA5", "domain_rank": 238, "main_image": "http://fthmb.tqn.com/stCpuzs7mVILFS9xc5p2ltdUfqs=/640x0/filters:no_upscale()/about/White-House-Easter-56a236bf5f9b58b7d0c7f711.jpg", "site_full": "dc.about.com", "title_full": "White House Easter Egg Roll 2017: Tickets, Talent & More", "spam_score": 0.005, "title": "White House Easter Egg Roll 2017: Tickets, Talent & More", "published": "2017-04-17T03:00:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Ue2ovhVfnF1D9SA__6_49aESrlmlLkYjVFgLwjWaJU97RWzDU4xovAr9XMnmFcEsGNjbEvIG7_twFiHo7v_kLA5", "author": "Rachel Cooper", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/+aboutdotcom", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/oYzpiARhtxGpQeyrSaU7ax2jwAQ=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/ParkHyattStKitts-58b2e7d45f9b5860466bac6c.jpg", "https://www.pinterest.com/aboutcomtravel/", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/tc9olltZDWIsnC-lpqpHGdcIjOs=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/capitol-building-170402241-58ddb7bf5f9b58468374c174.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/dos5cAktIxswAe8PhAgGW-BdTG0=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/GettyImages-124846685-589394d65f9b5874ee0312d4.jpg", "https://twitter.com/abouttravel", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/XIxTHATVZBzII49_HCZ3uCOW8KE=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/GettyImages-580470451-58b6e55b5f9b58604653eb93.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/gUX0Ao8BKEZApmnFRPG1vqpmBIQ=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/GettyImages-154917476-58b4b0e25f9b5860466f84fb.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/ZiY_kfxwIggjWClkBSXr9ztiwm4=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/GettyImages-148636845-58c2e1fa3df78c353c0c3cdd.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/hqNB_4tRQ2YBIW_e3MxKo5aWMDA=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/Cherry-Blossoms-56a239785f9b58b7d0c80d7a.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/QzeTKXfwH7Sgu3HurED0Aj4EKNM=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/DC-58e3adf23df78c5162fea85a.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/sO6iA4Dph60kcoPv90bMWjaGBiM=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/family-fun-56a239723df78cf772736c6f.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/aboutdotcomtravel", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/RCTKIMw-ogHb-i_rm4-GbKmaMQk=/385x0/filters:no_upscale()/about/White-House-Easter-56a236bf5f9b58b7d0c7f711.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/1if2aEpRLtZ26xItzN7O22tleQ0=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/kids-family.bmp-56a239533df78cf772736b33.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/stCpuzs7mVILFS9xc5p2ltdUfqs=/640x0/filters:no_upscale()/about/White-House-Easter-56a236bf5f9b58b7d0c7f711.jpg"], "title": "White House Easter Egg Roll 2017: Tickets, Talent & More", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Trump Extends Private-Sector Healthcare Program for Vets (AP) Wednesday, 19 Apr 2017 01:54 PM Close A A \nPresident Donald Trump has signed a bill extending a program that lets some veterans seek medical care in the private sector. \nThe extension will give Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin time to develop a more comprehensive plan to allow veterans to more easily go outside the VA health system for care.

(Photo by Laura Axelrod/ Special to Newsmax) By Greg Richter | Wednesday, 19 Apr 2017 01:58 PM Close A A \nIt's time conservatives stop using good manners with liberals and fight back, author David Horowitz told a crowd in Birmingham, Alabama, on Tuesday night. \nThe son of radical Communists told a group of more than 100 at a Fixed Point Foundation talk that he was \"sent to conservatives to teach them bad manners. Stop being so nice.\" \nHorowitz, author of The New York Times' bestseller \" Big Agenda: President Trump's Plan to Save America,\" urged those in attendance to follow Trump's example and take on liberal Democrats in the public arena with the same tactics they use against conservatives. \n\"This is a war; this is a street fight,\" he said. \"Republicans have to get in their faces.\" \nIn an interview with Newsmax after the event, Horowitz called the protests on college campuses shutting down himself and other conservative speakers \"incipient fascism,\" which is growing. \"It's very dangerous,\" he said. \nHorowitz spent his early years following in his parents' footsteps, but rejected Marxism in the 1970s, eventually coming out as a conservative when he supported Ronald Reagan's re-election in 1984. \n\"The Democratic Party today is a party of hate,\" not of ideas, he said, saying his statement was exemplified by the \"character assassination\" of Attorney General Jeff Sessions during his confirmation hearings. \nThe Birmingham crowd was familiar with the former Alabama senator's record, as were the Democratic senators who had served with him, in some cases for decades, Horowitz said. \nHe called Sessions, \"the most decent human being I know,\" but noted that during the hearings, \"Democrat after Democrat, with their leader Chuck Schumer, called him a racist.\" \nIt was the \"most disgraceful thing since the 'high-tech lynching' of [Supreme Court Justice] Clarence Thomas,\" Horowitz said. \nDemocrats see themselves as the \"secret redeemers\" of the imperfect world, he said, though they now prefer the term \"social justice warriors\" over \"communists.\" \n\"They see themselves as the party of the saints \u2014 and us as the party of the devil.\" \nWhen Donald Trump called Hillary Clinton a liar during the presidential election it was a breath of fresh air, Horowitz said. \"No other Republican in Christendom would have said that. \n\"Before Donald Trump, a debate between Democrats and Republicans was like Godzilla vs. Bambi,\" he said. \nConservatives across the board need to follow that lead, he said. \n\"If people with Judeo-Christian values don't get involved with the culture,\" he said, \"I fear the future will be dark.\" \n\"Big Agenda: President Trump's Plan to Save America\" is available at bookstores everywhere \u2014 or get yours FREE from Newsmax \u2013 Click Here Now .

The Haygood family weren\u2019t notified that John Benjamin had an outstanding warrant for battery involving a school employee. \nIn the video, taken by Luanne, John Benjamin sits slumped in a chair as Okeechobee County deputies reach for his hands, Luanne asking from behind the camera, \u201cDoes he have the same rights as an adult?\u201d \nJohn Benjamin then proceeds to tell the deputies, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be touched, I don\u2019t like to be touched,\u201d crying, as he puts his hands in the air in futility. \n\u201cIt\u2019s so fucking dumb, momma,\u201d John Benjamin says. \u201cIt\u2019s all their fucking fault!\u2026I didn\u2019t know I was going to go get arrested like this.\u201d One of the deputies cuffs his hands, then the other proceeds to escort the 10-year-old out of the school building and into a cop car. \nWhen Luanne asks to ride with her son to the police station, the officers tell her no. She asks for documentation, or an explanation for the arrest, and the officers decline. She explains that John Benjamin is autistic and scared, but the officers say he\u2019s going to be fine. According to the Post , Luanne\u2019s son spent the night locked up at a juvenile facility. \nJohn Benjamin\u2019s mother posted the video to Facebook , where it went viral. She\u2019s since taken it down. \nLuanne told the Post that John Benjamin had been diagnosed with autism two years ago and had an individual education plan, but was having issues with his assistant. He claimed she was hurting him, but the school wouldn\u2019t reassign him a new assistant. \nThen, on Oct. 27, John Benjamin kicked, scratched, and punched his assistant, after being told to go to timeout. The assistant had attempted to move him and had to restrain John Benjamin by wrapping his arms around the child\u2019s upper chest, according to documents. It\u2019s unknown why Luanne and the family weren\u2019t informed. \nProsecutor Ashley Albright is meeting with the educator who is pressing charges against John Benjamin, but said the State Attorney\u2019s Office will take his autism into consideration in deciding how to proceed with the case. \nAutism Society of America President Scott Badesh told the Post that the organization is in contact with the Haygood family to assist with services and legal counsel. The organization is also examining the incident to see if it can take the case to the Justice and Education Departments for investigation. \n\u201cIt appears the school\u2019s responses are beyond wrong and evil,\u201d Badesh said. \u201cIt is a tremendous failure by two allegedly responsible institutions\u2014the police and the school.\u201d \nAn Okeechobee County schools spokeswoman wouldn\u2019t disclose student information to the Post , but refuted that they would \u201cinvite someone to one of our campuses for the sole purpose to arrest.\u201d \nHaygood said that by sharing the jarring video of John Benjamin\u2019s arrest, she just wants her son \u201cto have the same education every other child is entitled to and receives.\u201d John Benjamin is due in court on May 11.

To qualify as skilled, immigrants will need to get a job in which they earn at least the median income. To qualify as highly skilled, they will need to earn at least 150 per cent of the median income. Other changes include a new three-year limit for workers with lower skills. \n\nWoodhouse said the changes would control the number and improve the quality of immigrants. \n\nIt is the second time New Zealand has tightened its immigration rules in the past six months and the latest changes come during an election year, when many people have expressed alarm at the immigration rate. \n\nIn the year ending in February, net immigration reached a record 71,300 people, equivalent to 1.5 per cent of New Zealand's total population of 4.8 million people. That's a big swing from five years earlier, when net immigration was negative as more people left the country than arrived. \n\nPart of the turnaround can be attributed to the nation's healthy economy, which is growing at more than 3 percent a year and is attracting back some New Zealanders who had moved abroad. \n\nThe largest numbers of new migrants to New Zealand are coming from China, India and the United Kingdom.

Kennedy\u2019s birth on May 29, the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History will display nine photographs of the 35th president, taken by renowned portraitist Richard Avedon. The above photos and contact sheets provide a first look at some of the portraits that will be in the exhibition, which will be on display from May 25 to August 27. Avedon was the only photographer who was allowed to take official photographs of JFK, his wife Jackie and his children, Caroline and John, between the time that he was elected in 1960 and Inauguration Day early the following year. The family sat for this Harper\u2019s Bazaar photo session on Jan. 3, 1961, against the photographer\u2019s signature white backdrop, just a few weeks before moving to the White House, at the Kennedy estate in West Palm Beach, Fla. (Jackie had already been photographed twice by Avedon for that magazine \u2014 in 1947 when she was voted Debutante of the Year and in 1958 as one of \u201cSix Faces of Beauty.\u201d) After the photographs ran in Harper\u2018s, they were seldom displayed or published in the years that followed. In other words, not only are they a rare look at a time in Kennedy\u2019s life, but they are also rarely seen. \u201cAvedon was at the height of his career\u201d when this brief photo session took place, according to Shannon Perich, curator at the National Museum of American History. And, though Kennedy was about to be President, the photographer\u2019s style was powerful too: \u201c[Avedon] changed the way we talked about portraiture,\u201d Perich says, referring to the fact that not every portrait features a smiling face. \u201cHe questioned whether portraits had to be flattering or not.\u201d Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter And if it seems as if the figures aren\u2019t totally focused on the camera, that\u2019s because the photo session was rather chaotic. That day \u2014 Jan. 3, 1961 \u2014 was the same day that the U.S. severed diplomatic ties with Cuba. Dressmakers working on Jackie\u2019s Oleg Cassini dress for the inauguration festivities were apparently there to work on the outfit, too. As Avedon told Newsweek shortly after the photographs were published, \u201cWhen I took Caroline\u2019s picture with her father, he was dictating memos to his secretary. \u2026 When I\u2019d ask him to look around, he\u2019d stop dictating. But the moment I finished, he\u2019d start in where he left off. I\u2019ve never seen such a display of mental control in my life.\u201d But the photos of the then-future President still manage to convey a warm vibe. \u201cThey show him as a paternalistic president, a loving, caring parent, who is going to protect us just as he takes care of his daughter,\u201d says Perich. The Smithsonian would give Avedon a solo show in 1962. In 1966, Avedon donated a set of the Kennedy images to the museum as part of a larger donation of 217 black-and-white photographs.", "crawled": "2017-04-20T02:55:03.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-19T22:00:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "1cdbbe80c61ee9996126a1f913322e61659a0ab1", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 980, "likes": 980}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "time.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://time.com/history/", "uuid": "1cdbbe80c61ee9996126a1f913322e61659a0ab1", "section_title": "History | Time.com", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 9, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpJ_AJul8iHvRBe1ILbV_kdrtlMK9JaSz9yt44QjpDmENsmqAu00pp7vFvEi3APG4Q-", "domain_rank": 643, "main_image": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/jfk-jackie-avedon-02.jpg?w=720", "site_full": "time.com", "title_full": "See Rare John F.

By the early 2000s, O\u2019Reilly was the highest-rated host, paving the way for Fox News to become the most-watched cable news network \u2015 a title the network hasn\u2019t relinquished since. \nIn a Wednesday memo to Fox News staff, 21st Century Fox Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch and his sons James and Lachlan didn\u2019t mention the scandal that brought down O\u2019Reilly, but noted that \u201cby ratings standards,\u201d he \u201cis one of the most accomplished TV personalities in the history of cable news.\u201d Spencer Platt/Getty Images Bill O'Reilly has ruled the cable news ratings for years. \nOf course it wasn\u2019t ratings that led to O\u2019Reilly\u2019s downfall, an unceremonious exit unparalleled in an industry where a TV news host\u2019s rise and fall is inextricably tied to viewership. His audience, averaging around 4 million viewers, appeared to be sticking by him even as advertisers fled in response to the New York Times revelations that the host and the network paid $13 million to five women over allegations of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior. \nBut the social media-driven advertiser exodus \u2015 along with public protests, continued fallout from the sexual harassment scandal involving former Fox News chairman Roger Ailes, and the possibility of sinking a major British TV deal \u2015 was apparently too much for the Murdochs. \nFox News isn\u2019t getting a political makeover as O\u2019Reilly leaves the building. In fact, the new opinion line-up may be more pro-Donald Trump than before, given that O\u2019Reilly, while largely supportive of the president, occasionally differed with him. \nThe more staunchly pro-Trump Eric Bolling will host a new 5 p.m. show, while \u201cThe Five,\u201d with Trump-sympathetic co-hosts Kimberly Guilfoyle and Jesse Watters , shifts to 9 p.m. (The rotating cast also includes co-hosts who have been critical of Trump, such as Bob Beckel, Juan Williams and Dana Perino.) \nAnd the unapologetically conservative Carlson will kick off primetime in the coveted 8 p.m. slot. Jahi Chikwendiu/The Washington Post via Getty Images Tucker Carlson brings strong conservative credentials and his own ratings success. \nCarlson\u2019s star has risen quickly at Fox News. A former CNN and MSNBC host, Carlson was leading \u201cFox & Friends Weekend\u201d before a promotion to replace Greta Van Susteren at 7 p.m. He improved ratings at that hour and created several viral moments while sparring with journalists such as Teen Vogue\u2019s Lauren Duca and Newsweek\u2019s Kurt Eichenwald . When Kelly left for NBC News in January, Carlson landed in her 9 p.m. slot . \nAlthough Kelly was a star, the network didn\u2019t miss a beat with Carlson\u2019s shift into primetime. His show averaged 3.27 million viewers during the first quarter of 2017, second only behind O\u2019Reilly\u2019s nearly 4 million. However, Carlson will now have to perform without the best lead-in in cable news. \nIt\u2019s unlikely that O\u2019Reilly viewers will flock to less partisan hosts (CNN) or avowedly progressive ones (MSNBC), and many who tuned in nightly will stick with Fox News as long as a right-leaning host is on air. But the question will be whether fans of O\u2019Reilly specifically will watch someone else in his time slot \u2015 or perhaps go see if a game\u2019s on. \nThough Fox News remains the ratings leader, the ground can shift. Liberals coping with Trump\u2019s presidency have been increasingly tuning into MSNBC , with 9 p.m. host Rachel Maddow recently topping O\u2019Reilly in the age 25-to-54 demographic prized by advertisers. Next week, a resurgent CNN plans to give Jake Tapper, the breakout news anchor of the Trump era, a tryout in primetime .

More With the simple submission of a technical sanctions waiver, oil giant Exxon Mobil created a potential PR headache for the White House. On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported Exxon is seeking a greenlight from the U.S. government to bypass sanctions on Russia and resume doing business with the country\u2019s state-owned oil giant Rosneft. It\u2019s hard to imagine how the optics could be worse. One of the biggest of the many scandals plaguing Trump\u2019s White House is the FBI investigation into whether his campaign coordinated with Russian intelligence to tip the election in his favor. An unverified dossier alleges that Rosneft may have played a role in the Russian election meddling. And Secretary of State Rex Tillerson happens to be the former Exxon CEO \u2014 who before becoming America\u2019s top diplomat had lobbied the Obama administration to ease sanctions that hamstrung Exxon\u2019s business in Russia. The State Department is one of several government agencies that will oversee Exxon\u2019s waiver application, though a State Department spokesman told the Wall Street Journal Tillerson (who received the Russian Order of Friendship in 2013) is recusing himself from any decisions relating to Exxon for two years. The sanctions were put in place in 2014, after Russia annexed Crimea. The sanctions prevent U.S. companies from dealings with Rosneft involving technology transfer, and also target Rosneft chief \u2014 and Putin confidant \u2014 Igor Sechin. Under Tillerson\u2019s leadership, Exxon paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to lobbying groups to argue against U.S. sanctions and he personally met with senior Obama White House officials a dozen times to discuss sanctions on Russia (though he assured Congressional leaders at his confirmation hearing in January he \u201cnever lobbied against sanctions personally\u201d and \u201cto [his] knowledge, Exxon never directly lobbied against sanctions.\u201d) Exxon figures the sanctions, which have forestalled exploration in places like the Russian Arctic, cost it at least $1 billion. Exxon is apparently trying to get U.S. permission to drill in the Russian Black Sea; if it doesn\u2019t drill an exploratory well this year, it could lose the concession. But existing sanctions aside, Exxon\u2019s efforts now to get access to deepwater, offshore oil fields is a little curious given the big global oil supply glut and still-cheap prices. Deepwater projects, like the one Exxon is trying to get going, generally need oil prices closer to $70 a barrel to be economic; crude oil has spent months in the $50 a barrel range. (Exxon\u2019s other sanctions-stalled project with Rosneft, in the chilly Kara Sea, would be an even dicier proposition at these prices.) But under the terms of its agreement with Rosneft, Exxon\u2019s Black Sea play could expire if it doesn\u2019t act soon, so it presumably wants to keep the proverbial pilot light on so they\u2019re ready to pounce when prices rebound. Another reason could be sheer competitive pressure. The European Union is granting sanctions waivers to its own companies, including Italian oil company Eni, to explore cooperation with Russia in the Black and Barents Seas, even while the sanctions freeze out U.S. firms. \u201cExxon is worried it could get boxed out of the Black Sea by the Italians,\u201d one person briefed on the Exxon waiver told the Journal.

For the first time, a new study has showed the diversity of brain activity increasing as a result of taking these drugs. Scientists say the findings could lead to new treatments for mental health conditions, including depression and schizophrenia\u2014as well as answering fundamental questions about our conscious experience. Anil Seth, co-director of the Sackler Centre for Consciousness Science at the University of Sussex in southern England, is an author of the study published in Scientific Reports . He tells Newsweek : \u201c[A higher state of consciousness] has a very specific meaning in terms of this study, and that meaning can get a little conflated with the hippy idea of a higher state of consciousness and psychedelic drugs.\n\u201cWhat we mean in this study is the measure of the mathematical diversity of brain activity, which, very roughly, is how unpredictable the activity of the brain is. We use this [because] this measure has previously been applied to try to track changes when people fall asleep or go under general anesthesia, which would generally be thought of as a lower state of consciousness.\u201d\nTrending: Attack on North Korea Could Start a War in Asia for U.S., Japan, South Korea And Other Nations\nWhile scientists already know that diversity lowers when people are asleep, the researchers were interested in what happens when people go the other way. People in a psychedelic state are conscious and they often report experiencing things like hallucinations. \u201cBoundaries between self and world disintegrate and things like that,\u201d Seth explains. \u201cWe predicted that instead of a reduction in the level of diversity [as seen when you go to sleep], we\u2019d see an increase. And that\u2019s what we found\u2026 it\u2019s higher on this specific scale of diversity, or unpredictability of the brain activity. This is the first example that I\u2019m aware of where it goes in the other direction, where you see an increase in this measure.\u201d\nScientific testing of psychedelic drugs Scientists have investigated the potential therapeutic benefits of these drugs for many years. LSD, for example, was first synthesized by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann in 1938. Ten years later, U.S. researchers started testing its potential clinical applications and continued to do so for decades. However, as people started taking the drug recreationally in the mid-1960s, governments made the drug illegal, and restrictions on the drug largely stopped scientific testing with LSD.\nIn 2014, Robin Carhart-Harris became the first person in the U.K. to administer LSD to humans for research purposes for over 40 years. Studies remain relatively few due to the difficulties getting approval to use a restricted drug. In his study, published in 2016 , scientists gave participants doses of LSD, ketamine and psilocybin. They then looked at the participants\u2019 brain activity, providing the first image showing what happens to people\u2019s brains on psychedelic drugs.\nIn the latest study, scientists (including Carhart-Harris) went one step further to show not only that brain activity changes, but how it does; that the brain enters this higher state of consciousness. They measured the tiny magnetic fields produced by the brain in different states to look at differences between the three drugs and normal consciousness. Their findings showed that the baseline for brain signal diversity when people were on psychedelic drugs was consistently higher than when they were in a normal waking state.\nDon't miss: Did Donald Trump Purposely Not Mention Tom Brady During the Patriots' White House Visit?\nCarhart-Harris said in a statement, \u201cPeople often say they experience insight under these [psychedelic] drugs\u2014and when this occurs in a therapeutic context, it can predict positive outcomes. The present findings may help us understand how this can happen.\"\nThis doesn\u2019t means your brain on psychedelic drugs is better: \u201cThis is not at all judgment of quality, that higher is better,\u201d Seth explains. \u201c[Brain activity] is different and it\u2019s higher on this specific one dimensional scale.\u201d\nPsychedelic More Psychedelic art. Drugs like LSD and ketamine make the brain enter a \"higher state of consciousness,\" according to a new study. chiaralily/Flicrk\nWhat the study does show is the state of the brain on psychedelics is distinctive and has implications for other changes in consciousness. \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing in this study is trying to understand what\u2019s happening in the brain\u2026 and [what] may in turn have a therapeutic effect,\u201d Seth says. \u201cThese studies of the effects of psychedelic drugs has only just really restarted after many years in the wilderness.\u201d\nMost popular: Bill O\u2019Reilly Won't Return to Fox Following Sexual Harassment Allegations\nTherapeutic uses and our understanding of consciousness One avenue of research Carhart-Harris is keen to explore is how drugs like LSD and ketamine can be used to treat conditions such as depression. His previous research showed psychedelic drugs providing some significant benefits to people with depression. But currently, scientists do not understand exactly how or why this is.\n\u201cBesides the fact that it actually changes [a depressed person\u2019s] experience of the world\u2014it might kick them out of the ruminative tendencies and other things\u2014we don\u2019t know why this is happening,\u201d Seth says. \u201cThere are clues. For instance LSD works on the same chemical system in the brain that antidepressants work\u2014the serotonin system. We know there\u2019s a pharmacological link, we know there\u2019s a change in experience and we know there\u2019s a clinical impact. But the middle bit if you like, what are these drugs doing to the global activity of the brain, that\u2019s the gap we\u2019re trying to fill with this study.\u201d\nSeth and his colleagues will be doing follow-up research. He plans to focus on the basis of conscious experience by using psychedelic manipulation to change the way people experience the world. This will allow researchers to better understand what happens to the brain when people are undergoing things like hallucinations.\n\u201cIf we can understand the brain basis of hallucinations then we\u2019ll understand a lot more about hallucinations\u2014and not just about psychedelia but also in schizophrenia and other conditions,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ll also understand a lot more about how our visual experiences in the normal world happen. We\u2019re hallucinating all the time, it\u2019s just our hallucinations are usually controlled by the sensory data that we get.\u201d Through digging into their data, Seth hopes to understand more about the basis of conscious experience.\nDavid Nutt, a neuropsychopharmacologist fro m Imperial College London, and advocate of increased scientific testing on the effects of psychedelic drugs, commented on the study in an email to Newsweek : \u201cThis work supports the idea we have been suggesting for several years now that the psychedelic state is a scientifically important one for neuroscience. It represents a fundamentally different state of consciousness to that of normal waking consciousness and in the words of William James\u2014one of the founders of modern brain science: \u2018No account of the universe in its totality can be final that leaves these disregarded.\u2019\n\u201cThis new paper goes further and suggest that psychedelic consciousness may be a higher form of consciousness given its increased level of complexity.

Jason Chaffetz unexpectedly announced Wednesday that he would not run for re-election in 2018 or any other office. The chairman of the powerful House Oversight Committee, Chaffetz also ran for Speaker of the House in 2015 after Rep. John Boehner stepped down.\nAnticipating people\u2019s surprise, Chaffetz said in a Facebook post that \u201cfor those that would speculate otherwise, let me be clear that I have no ulterior motives\u201d and that his decision was the result of \u201clong consultation with my family and prayerful consideration.\u201d\nBut Chaffetz was also facing a tougher-than-usual re-election battle with a potential primary challenge from the Republican mayor of Provo, John Curtis. The crowdfunding site CrowdPac has already raised over $11,000 in pledges if Curtis agreed to challenge the congressman.\n\u201cHe\u2019s been toying with this idea after residents have come to him ask him to run and I would be lying to you if I told you he wasn\u2019t looking at it,\u201d said Corey Norman, a spokesman for the mayor. \u201cThings certainly just got more real.\u201d\nPresident Trump has never been especially popular in Utah, a majority Mormon state, and Chaffetz\u2019s support of the president had earned him heaps of scorn at town halls.\nHis likely Democratic challenger next fall is political newcomer and family physician Dr. Kathryn Allen, who had an uphill battle in the red district. She has already raised over $560,000 for her campaign, an almost unprecedented sum for a non-incumbent congressional campaign 18 months away from Election Day. Chaffetz had only $403,000 in his account through the end of March.\nChaffetz left open the possibility that he would run for office again, potentially in the 2020 governor\u2019s race. He previously served as chief of staff to then-Gov. Jon Huntsman.\nDemocrats in Congress have been especially critical of Chaffetz for not vigilantly investigating President Trump and the billionaire\u2019s potential conflicts of interest. They argued that he was shielding a president of his own party after relentlessly investigating Democrat Hillary Clinton last fall for her email scandal. Before the election, Chaffetz and other Republicans on the committee were quietly preparing to investigate Clinton\u2019s emails for potentially years but have since let the investigation go by the wayside.", "crawled": "2017-04-20T02:20:20.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "171f9dd8bf2af2a4ddeb99105e2fe2da60259e51", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 842, "likes": 842}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "vice.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "https://news.vice.com/", "uuid": "171f9dd8bf2af2a4ddeb99105e2fe2da60259e51", "section_title": "VICE News", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 8, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSDv01l.PjkX5kRdWBkNT_Yk41l.XlgHfOAiIg_Y5xqqKrANxEuKQDsC.9hrABWLbihx5wrwu1JpE.8yAhZzLVI3gehicKVUN7LtquuE7JJ34x7icFx3S6c", "domain_rank": 173, "main_image": "https://news.vice.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/AP_17041135519884-1024x785.jpg", "site_full": "news.vice.com", "title_full": "Powerful Republican Jason Chaffetz says he won\u2019t run for Congress again \u2013 VICE News", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Powerful Republican Jason Chaffetz says he won\u2019t run for Congress again", "published": "2017-04-19T03:00:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "provo"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "utah"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "jason chaffetz"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "alex thompson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "corey norman"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "hillary clinton"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "chaffetz"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "curtis"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "john curtis"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kathryn allen"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "jon huntsman"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "john boehner"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "clinton"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "trump"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "congress"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "democratic"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "house"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "house oversight committee"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "facebook"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSDv01l.PjkX5kRdWBkNT_Yk41l.XlgHfOAiIg_Y5xqqKrANxEuKQDsC.9hrABWLbihx5wrwu1JpE.8yAhZzLVI3gehicKVUN7LtquuE7JJ34x7icFx3S6c", "author": "Alex Thompson", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SUF4ecdtw5M?iv_load_policy=3&modestbranding=1&rel=0&autohide=1&playsinline=1&autoplay=0", "https://www.facebook.com/JasonChaffetz1/", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Powerful", "https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.vice.com%2Fstory%2Fpowerful-republican-jason-chaffetz-wont-run-for-congress-again", "https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SUF4ecdtw5M?iv_load_policy=3&#038;modestbranding=1&#038;rel=0&#038;autohide=1&#038;playsinline=1&#038;autoplay=0", "https://www.crowdpac.com/campaigns/202251/lets-draft-provo-mayor-john-curtis-for-utahs-3rd-congressional-district/endorsements"], "title": "Powerful Republican Jason Chaffetz says he won\u2019t run for Congress again", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Continue reading the main story None of the companies that pulled out of \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d or Breitbart News are exactly a profile in courage.

Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed Just compare the inclusive if dull message you hear from corporations with the state of our political culture, where the vilifying of enemies (the elite, welfare queens, the deplorables) is still a critical tool. Donald Trump won an election despite the creepy predatory comments he made on the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape. But Mr. O\u2019Reilly is being shown the door for acting toward women exactly as Mr. Trump had suggested (\u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\u201d). Not that he needed the encouragement, apparently. Steve King, a five-time congressman from Iowa, has plagued the public arena for years with his barely concealed white nationalism. By contrast, when Donald Sterling, the longtime owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, was heard on tape disparaging African-Americans, the N.B.A. revoked his right to ownership and put the team up for auction. The N.B.A. did this even though Mr. Sterling was speaking in private about associates of his ex-girlfriend, who secretly taped him as part of an extortion plot. In the 1980s and \u201990s, companies were more likely to fold under pressure from conservative groups policing the airwaves. \u201cWe are in business to make friends,\u201d said a Coca-Cola spokesman after the company pulled ads from the Fox show \u201cMarried \u2026 With Children.\u201d Today, companies have been pushed in a much more progressive direction, largely because they build their brand on consistent messages not just on television, but also on YouTube and social media. The sheer ubiquity of corporate branding (\u201cJust Do It,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Lovin\u2019 It\u201d) turns consumers into what business scholars call \u201csecondary stakeholders,\u201d people with no financial stake in a company who nevertheless have an interest in the brand.
