Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images 800 \nThis week, the New York Times published an editorial headlined, \u201cThe L.G.B.T Trump Fallacy,\u201d in which the editorial board explained that, \u201cthe nomination of several key officials [within the Trump administration], who have disparaged the L.G.B.T. community and sought to curtail the rights of its members, has exposed the narrative that Mr. Trump would be a champion of gay and transgender people as a fallacy.\u201d \nBetter late than never, some would say, since many of us across a variety of media have been pointing out the virulent homophobes named to the cabinet and other jobs for months , including during the transition , while the Times , both in news coverage and opinion pieces, hardly covered the topic. But what\u2019s especially grating about the Times editorial is the line about how these nominations have \u201cexposed the narrative that Mr. Trump would be a champion of gay and transgender people as a fallacy.\u201d \nHow did that \u201cnarrative\u201d begin? According to the Times editorial, it happened after Trump unfurled a rainbow flag onstage during a rally in October of last year. \n\u201cIt didn\u2019t take long for prominent gay Republicans to proclaim that the Republican Party had, at long last, turned a corner on gay rights under Mr. Trump,\u201d the editorial stated. \nReally? \nThis was, at best, a complete oversight by the editorial board, whose writers clearly hadn\u2019t been following these events more closely throughout the campaign. Because those of us who followed the campaign, and particularly covered LGBT issues, know precisely where the \u201cnarrative\u201d was hatched: In The New York Times itself, on April 22, of 2016, with a story headlined , \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s More Accepting Views on Gay Issues Set Him Apart in G.O.P.\u201d \nThe piece, by Times political reporter Maggie Haberman, offered what several LGBT journalists and commentators saw as weak evidence of this claim, and I wrote about it in detail at the time , also pointing to how superficial the evidence was. Haberman defended her piece on Twitter, saying it was more so about Trump\u2019s \u201chistory,\u201d particularly, it seemed, since the story\u2019s hook became dated literally within hours of her publishing it: Trump had seemed to come out against North Carolina\u2019s horrendous anti-LGBT law \u2015 the hook for the story \u2015 only to flip-flop a day later and say that states should have the right to pass such laws. \nThe Times piece stuck, exemplifying the power of the paper in setting a \u201cnarrative,\u201d and from that point on, in story after story in other publications and on cable news, Trump was portrayed as pro-LGBTQ. This, in spite of his courting of religious conservatives and his promises to them to roll back LGBT rights and marriage equality specifically, promising to appoint justices to the Supreme Court who would overturn the Obergefell ruling, which he opposed . \nOver the following months I wrote piece after piece taking on the narrative, as did other commentators, but it was to no avail. The media stuck to the narrative, blowing it up when Trump said something that fit it \u2015 like using the initialism \u201cLGBTQ\u201d at the GOP convention \u2015 and ignoring his various sit-downs with evangelical media or appearances with anti-LGBTQ groups in which he promoted an anti-LGBTQ agenda. Of course, gay Republicans were backing him \u2015 they back just about every Republican candidate in spite of the candidate\u2019s opposition to LGBTQ rights \u2015 but that was happening well before Trump unfurled a rainbow flag in October. \nNo, gay Republicans were not responsible for creating the \u201cLGBT Trump Fallacy.\u201d It\u2019s great to see the Times editorial page taking on the \u201cfallacy,\u201d but the least it could have done was explain how the \u201cnarrative\u201d truly began.

The Islamic State group quickly claimed responsibility for the attack, which hit just three days before a tense presidential election. Security already has been a dominant theme in the campaign, and the violence on the sparkling avenue threatened to weigh on voters' decisions. Candidates canceled or rescheduled final campaign events ahead of Sunday's first round vote.\nInvestigators searched a home early Friday in an eastern suburb of Paris believed linked to the attack. A police document obtained by The Associated Press identifies the address searched in the town of Chelles as the family home of Karim Cheurfi, a 39-year-old with a criminal record.\nPolice tape surrounded the quiet, middle-class neighborhood in Chelles, and worried neighbors expressed surprise at the searches. Archive reports by French newspaper Le Parisien say that Cheurfi was convicted of attacking a police officer in 2001.\nAuthorities are trying to determine whether \"one or more people\" might have helped the attacker, Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet told reporters at the scene of the shooting.\nOne officer was killed and two police officers were seriously wounded when the attacker emerged from a car and used an automatic weapon to shoot at officers outside a Marks & Spencer's department store at the center of the Champs-Elysees, anti-terrorism prosecutor Francois Molins said.\nA female foreign tourist also was wounded, Molins said.\nThe Islamic State group's claim of responsibility just a few hours after the attack came unusually swiftly for the extremist group, which has been losing territory in Iraq and Syria.\nIn a statement from its Amaq news agency, the group gave a pseudonym for the shooter, Abu Yusuf al-Beljiki, indicating he was Belgian or had lived in Belgium. Belgian authorities said they had no information about the suspect. IS described the shootings as an attack \"in the heart of Paris.\"\nThe attacker had been flagged as an extremist, according to two police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss the investigation.\nBrandet said officers were \"deliberately\" targeted, as has happened repeatedly to French security forces in recent years, including preceding the 2012 election.\nPolice and soldiers sealed off the area, ordering tourists back into hotels and blocking people from approaching the scene.\nEmergency vehicles blocked the wide Champs-Elysees, an avenue lined with boutiques and normally packed with cars and tourists that cuts across central Paris between the Arc de Triomphe and the Tuileries Gardens. Subway stations were closed off.\nThe gunfire sent scores of tourists fleeing into side streets.\n\"They were running, running,\" said 55-year-old Badi Fta\u00efti, who lives in the area. \"Some were crying. There were tens, maybe even hundreds of them.\"\nFrench President Francois Hollande said he was convinced the circumstances of the attack in a country pointed to a terrorist act. Hollande held an emergency meeting with the prime minister Thursday night and planned to convene the defense council Friday morning.\nThe incident recalled two recent attacks on soldiers providing security at prominent locations around Paris: one at the Louvre museum in February and one at Orly airport last month.\nSpeaking in Washington during a news conference with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, U.S. President Donald Trump said the shooting \"looks like another terrorist attack\" and sent condolences to France.\nA French television station hosting an event with the 11 candidates running for president briefly interrupted its broadcast to report the shootings.\nConservative contender Francois Fillon, who has campaigned against \"Islamic totalitarianism,\" said on France 2 television that he was canceling his planned campaign stops Friday.\nFar-right candidate Marine Le Pen, who campaigns against immigration and Islamic fundamentalism, took to Twitter to offer her sympathy for law enforcement officers \"once again targeted.\" She canceled a minor campaign stop, but scheduled another.\nCentrist candidate Emmanuel Macron offered his thoughts to the family of the dead officer.\nSocialist Benoit Hamon tweeted his \"full support\" to police against terrorism.\nThe two top finishers in Sunday's election will advance to a runoff on May 7.\n___\nAssociated Press Writers Angela Charlton and Raphael Satter in Paris, Jeff Schaeffer and Nadine Achoui-Lesage in Chelles, France, and Raf Casert in Brussels contributed to this report.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "johanna primevert", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "franklin roosevelt subway station", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "champs-elysees", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-20T22:50:42.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e5ff95e28c63ca2f6fd3859c7e8c3041fbbb114b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXPYMuerT5VqYbpDiYHicaP2kpiwE87CQzO6DNF027rAUkGADrhwVQhCzYDOLn_hCnGNJanGtIBRZjRav4BGh6HswycrhK5d9M09WVcr9WX1fOC3Q5jDhY4-", "site_full": "www.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://www.yahoo.com/celebrity/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Yahoo Celebrity", "title": "Kris Has \u2018Never Been So Angry\u2019 After Reading Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s Book", "title_full": "Kris Jenner Has \u2018Never Been So Angry\u2019 After Reading Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s New Book", "published": "2017-04-20T05:04:12.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/SwFTdEsAWfXy7AlzVDlHgA--/aD0xMDA5O3c9NzQ0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/de4f50b2115af62f66a6028f670fdb81", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 999, "comments": 0, "shares": 999}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e5ff95e28c63ca2f6fd3859c7e8c3041fbbb114b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXPYMuerT5VqYbpDiYHicaP2kpiwE87CQzO6DNF027rAUkGADrhwVQhCzYDOLn_hCnGNJanGtIBRZjRav4BGh6HswycrhK5d9M09WVcr9WX1fOC3Q5jDhY4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Taryn Ryder", "published": "2017-04-20T05:04:12.000+03:00", "title": "Kris Has \u2018Never Been So Angry\u2019 After Reading Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s Book", "text": "View photos\nCaitlyn Jenner and Kris Jenner at the 2015 Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show. (Photo: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for Victoria\u2019s Secret) More Caitlyn Jenner is spilling all the (alleged) tea in her upcoming memoir, and her ex-wife Kris Jenner isn\u2019t having it. In a clip for Sunday\u2019s Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Kris vents to daughters Khlo\u00e9 and Kim after reading an advanced copy of The Secrets of My Life .\n\u201cI read it, and basically the only nice thing she had to say was that I was great socially at a party one time,\u201d Kris, who was married to Bruce for 22 years, tells her daughters. \u201cNone of it makes sense. Everything she says is all made up. Why does everything have to be that Kris is such a b**** and an a**hole?\u201d\nIt\u2019s been about two years since the gold medal-winning Olympian publicly transitioned from Bruce to Caitlyn. Since then, one of the biggest points of contention between Kris and Caitlyn has been over when Kris knew about her former husband\u2019s gender identity struggle. That is brought up again in Caitlyn\u2019s book.\n\u201cI was curious and said, \u2018What the hell is going on?\u2019\u201d Kris, 61, reflects on pressing Bruce years ago. \u201cShe said, \u2018You just would never understand.\u2019 And then, all through the book, Kris knew. \u2018Kris knew before I even made love to her.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018What?\u2019\u201d\nThat\u2019s not all Caitlyn has to say about their intimate life. In an excerpt obtained by People , she describes the sex as \u201cimbued with love\u201d but admits she wasn\u2019t \u201centirely comfortable\u201d with the act.\nView photos\nBruce and Kris Jenner were married for 22 years. (Photo: Beck Starr/FilmMagic) More \u201cWe fall in love quickly (we marry after seven months),\u201d Caitlyn writes . \u201cSince \u2014 let\u2019s not kid ourselves \u2014 everyone wants to know, Kris and I have good and frequent sex at the beginning.\u201d\nShe continues, \u201cI tell Kris about my gender issues before I make love to her. This will always be a subject of dispute between us. She insists that she was taken by surprise by my ultimate transition to Caitlyn, which obviously means in her mind that she did not know enough.\u201d\nCaitlyn, 67, adds she dressed as a woman a number of times in front of Kris.\nAll that info apparently is enough for Kris to be \u201cdone\u201d with Caitlyn. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so angry and disappointed in someone in my whole life,\u201d Kris says on Sunday\u2019s Keeping Up . \u201cI\u2019m not going to be used as a person who benefits someone else\u2019s life just to make them look better.

Chelsea\u2019s medical staff assessed him in the away changing room and the wing-back was withdrawn from the team, with the league leaders going on to lose the match 2-0 to leave their advantage at the top trimmed to four points from Tottenham Hotspur with six games left to play.\nAlonso\u2019s late withdrawal forced C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta to fill in on the left, with Kurt Zouma drafted in as a right-sided full-back and it clearly affected the balance of Conte\u2019s team. Yet Alonso was not the only Chelsea player still suffering from the virus which had set in within the squad towards the end of last week.\nOne theory that has been considered by the club is that the bug had spread through the squad at a team bonding meal \u2013 one of a number arranged by Conte over the course of the season to strengthen the group \u2013 last Thursday evening.\nVictor Moses, only just returned from a calf injury, had also been hampered and, having started the game, had to be withdrawn nine minutes into the second half prompting further disruption to the visitors\u2019 approach. Diego Costa is understood to have been unwell and, like Moses and Alonso, had missed training at the back end of last week prior to his side\u2019s trip to the north-west.\nJohn Terry seeks Premier League stay after announcing plan to leave Chelsea Read more\nThe striker declared himself fit but struggled to make much of an impact during the game, embroiled as he was from early on in tussles with Eric Bailly and Marcos Rojo in the hosts\u2019 back-line. Costa, who was eventually booked for a foul on Paul Pogba, has failed to score in five consecutive Premier League games for the first time in his career in English football \u2013 his last club goal was at West Ham in the first week of March.

They scoot over so a Muslim mother could sit and nurse her baby, on Easter Sunday. This is my America: people letting people be people.\u201d \nThe Facebook post had garnered more than 75,000 reactions and 58,000 shares by Wednesday afternoon. People commented on the photo to celebrate the diversity that it reflects, and what that means for the country. \n\u201cTHIS, is what makes America great and these days I\u2019ve been struggling to find ways to feel good about America,\u201d one person wrote on Facebook . \u201cWe, the people...Thank you for restoring a little of my faith in humanity today, Jackie. \u201d \n\u201cThis gives me JOY!

It\u2019s worth noting that he didn\u2019t ask the riders\u2019 permission to take or post the image, as he said that would have \u201cfelt forced and staged.\u201d \n\u201cThe moment is extraordinary in its ordinariness: common courtesy as an afterthought is the NYC and the America I was raised to believe in,\u201d Summers told The Huffington Post in an email. \u201cGiven the age of divisiveness we live in, it seems people are looking at this photo as a reason to put issues like race, religion, and sex aside to focus on more important issues relevant to peaceful coexistence.\u201d \nSince the election of President Donald Trump, several interactions on the New York City subway have garnered nationwide attention for highlighting diversity and division in the U.S.: In February, for example, subway riders were photographed cleaning swastikas off of a train\u2019s walls , and in March, a young Latina woman was filmed shutting down a fellow rider\u2019s xenophobic rant . \n\u201cAs the grandchild of immigrants, my ancestors believed America to be a place where the possibility of equity existed,\u201d Summers said. \u201cWhile it\u2019s clear we still have a long way to go to achieve that goal, I and people like me across this nation are fighting every day to see that end.\u201d \nFor HuffPost\u2019s #LoveTakesAction series, we\u2019re telling stories of how people are standing up to hate and supporting those most threatened.

Credit Mekameleen TV, via Youtube A video has emerged that appears to show members of the Egyptian military shooting unarmed detainees to death at point-blank range in the Sinai Peninsula and staging the killings to look as if they had happened in combat. The leaked video, which was posted on social media on Thursday, could undercut claims made by the Egyptian Army in December that the men were suspected terrorists who died in a fight with the military. The video was released the same day that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis met in Egypt with its president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, to discuss improving their countries\u2019 military relationship. It also comes after human rights groups accused the Egyptian military of killing up to 10 men in January in a staged counterterrorism raid in Sinai. The three-minute video, which was released through a channel associated with the Muslim Brotherhood , appears to depict part of a raid that the Egyptian Army highlighted in a Facebook post on Dec. 6, 2016 . That post included photos of three bloody men in a grassy area with rifles next to them. The post said they had been killed in a military raid on a terrorist base and an explosives storehouse. Eight people were killed and four others were arrested, the military said on Facebook in December, as Egyptian armed forces \u201ccontinued to tighten their security grip\u201d in the Sinai Peninsula, where the country has waged a yearslong battle. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story But the video shows no firefight and starts with soldiers mingling next to an armored truck in a sandy field scattered with bodies next to shrubs and grassy patches. But it does show the killing of at least three people. In one case, a soldier casually holds a rifle over a man on the ground and shoots him in the head. In another, soldiers escort a blindfolded man into the field, place him on his knees and shoot him multiple times in the head and upper body. The pro-state Egyptian news site Youm7 called the video a fabrication carried out by the Muslim Brotherhood, which is banned in the country, and said the people in the video did not have Egyptian accents. An Egyptian military spokesman did not respond to a request for comment late Thursday.

Between a flawed love life, a flailing career and daily struggles with weight, she finds her meaty story. Noor Review : Who knew Sonakshi Sinha was capable of this all along? movie Watching her play this part is the most starkly disorienting thing about Noor. The movie gives her a chance to be an actual flesh-and-bone person. She\u2019s relatable as a girl who swears by her rum (and suffers hangovers), eats cake in bed (and dreads getting on a weighing scale) and becomes the third wheel on a friend\u2019s date (while cursing her own single life). We\u2019ve all been there. Noor (Sinha) wants to shine a light on serious issues but is stuck being the torchbearer of mediocre puff pieces. Her childhood friend Saad (Gill) gives her pep-talks from the friendzone and her mentor (Chaudhary) reigns her in when she\u2019s too enthusiastic about a new expos\u00e9. Even as she\u2019s coming to terms with the hotness of her new boyfriend, Ayan (Kohli), her maid Malti (Tambe) brings a major organ-trade racket to her notice. Director Sunhil Sippy has achieved the rare feat of not stereotyping people in the media by showing them as jhola-toting opinionated creatures. There\u2019s an instant connect with Noor\u2019s world; her friends are as silly as yours, her issues are at times frivolous but her quarter-life crisis seems credible. The film is slightly over-written (a whole lot of dialogue) but lines are mostly funny. Since the movie gets this generation right, it has to get its flaws right too. Noor introduces a conflict which is serious and relevant, but offers very little by way of resolution. It unintentionally gives a nod to armchair-activism, and as representative of our time as it is, it simply cannot cover-up the lazy writing towards the end. A slightly stronger effort on the protagonist\u2019s part could have propelled the movie into greatness. But where Noor falls short, Sinha rises to the occasion. Gill brings a lightheartedness to the movie and Smita Tambe delivers equally well in half the screen-time. This is the great debut that has come seven years into Sonakshi\u2019s career. And for that, you must go meet Noor at theatre.

By Nick Wing \nAt jails and prisons around the U.S., inmates who seek medical care must pay a fee of a few dollars or more before seeing a doctor, dentist or other health professional. Now, a new report shows how these copays can restrict access to care for incarcerated people who often make just cents for an hour of work \u2015 and nothing at all in some states. \nA total of 42 states allow for some form of copay for non-emergency, patient-initiated visits with jail or prison medical staff, according to the report that the nonprofit Prison Policy Initiative published Wednesday. Fees in most states range between $2 to $8 per appointment. In Texas, inmates must pay $100 per year for medical care. Federal prisons require a $2 copay . \nThese fees don\u2019t apply to most indigent inmates and, thanks in part to a 1976 Supreme Court ruling guaranteeing \u201cadequate\u201d health care for prisoners, correctional facilities can\u2019t deny care to inmates for lack of payment. Copays are also typically waived for chronic treatment, or jail or prison-mandated screenings. \nIn a world of rising health care costs, some people might wish they only had copays of a few bucks. Behind bars, however, inmates pay these fees with general commissary funds, which they also use to buy items like snacks, medicine, stationary and other supplies. \nWith prison jobs serving as the only source of spending money for many incarcerated people, the Prison Policy Initiative calculated what percentage of a monthly minimum-wage prison income an inmate in each state would have to spend on a single copay. Prison Policy Initiative Inmates in most states would have to spend a substantial portion of their monthly income just to afford one medical copay. \nAlabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, South Carolina and Texas don\u2019t guarantee prisoners any payment for their work, so it\u2019s possible they\u2019d never make enough money to see a doctor. In West Virginia, for example, the hourly minimum wage for a prison job is a mere 4 cents, meaning a $5 copay would cost an incarcerated person almost an entire month\u2019s pay. \nThe Prison Policy Initiative also calculated the \u201cfree world\u201d cost of a prison copay by assessing the total number of hours it would take an inmate to make that money in each state and comparing it to the state\u2019s minimum wage. Prison Policy Initiative In West Virginia, a minimum-wage prisoner would have to work 125 hours to make enough money for a copay. In \"free world\" cost, that amounts to $1,093. \nCopays are just part of a broader program of fees that jails and prisons heap on incarcerated people and their families. \n\u201cThey\u2019re another way of nickel and diming people who don\u2019t have anything,\u201d said report author Wendy Sawyer, a policy analyst at the Prison Policy Initiative. \nAlthough copays come at a huge cost to inmates, they provide very little in the way of direct financial returns to state correctional systems. For example, Michigan collected less than $200,000 on these fees in 2014, according to a Pew report , recouping just a tiny portion of its $300 million prison health care budget. The Michigan auditor general responded to those numbers by pressuring the state\u2019s Department of Corrections to be more aggressive in collecting copays from inmates. \nCorrections officials often cite copays as a way to save money because they discourage inmates from making frivolous requests for medical attention. \nJails and prisons tend to be filled with people \u201cwho have not put their health as a priority\u201d and who may attempt to abuse sick call, said Brooke Keast, public information officer at the Nevada Department of Corrections. With a prison copay of $8, Nevada is second to Texas as the most expensive state for incarcerated individuals seeking medical care. \n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have guidelines, it\u2019s a constant guess as to whether they\u2019re really hurting,\u201d Keast said. \n\u201cIt\u2019s up to the officers to make sure that the people who need to get seen get seen,\u201d she added. \nMaking inmates tap into their limited funds to receive medical care may cut down on feigned illness in jails and prisons, but copays can also make such care cost-prohibitive for inmates in legitimate need. \n\u201cCorrectional people may think it\u2019s a deterrent for this annoying population who just wants attention, but in reality they probably have a lot of legitimate health concerns to be addressed,\u201d Sawyer said. \nMedical copays for incarcerated individuals have gotten increasingly popular as prisons and jails look for ways to cut costs and, in the case of privately run facilities, maximize profits. In effect, the goal of this system is to allow administrators to get away with providing less overall care to inmates, said Brad Brockmann, executive director for the nonprofit Center for Prisoner Health and Human Rights. \n\u201cOne of the few areas where correctional facilities have control over the budget is providing health care,\u201d Brockmann said. \u201cSomebody who doesn\u2019t come in is somebody who isn\u2019t costing them anything.\u201d The health of the prison population is worse on average -- if not much worse -- than the general public, so to have this in place in any prison is unethical. \nBut this approach may ultimately end up costing the prison health care system more by leading incarcerated individuals to put off routine preventive care, potentially until health problems get much worse. \n\u201cBy the time they absolutely have to see a doctor, it\u2019s way more expensive, way harder to treat and it puts them at greater risk,\u201d Sawyer said. \nCopayments can also compound existing inequities in correctional facilities. \nPrison populations tend to be split into two tiers, explains the Center for Prisoner Health and Human Rights in a paper laying out its opposition to copays . On one end are inmates with families or support networks that have the means to provide them with spending money. Even these individuals may choose to forgo medical care if they decide the funds could be better spent on essential commissary items. \nOn the other end are inmates who are indigent or completely reliant on prison jobs for income. Many of them may not even consider using their funds on a luxury like a doctor\u2019s visit. \nAll of these factors disproportionately restrict access to care for an already marginalized population not just of incarcerated individuals, but of those who tend to be poorer, less health literate and perhaps already less healthy. \n\u201cThe health of the prison population is worse on average \u2015 if not much worse \u2015 than the general public, so to have this in place in any prison is unethical,\u201d said J. Wesley Boyd, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard University and a member of the school\u2019s Center for Bioethics. \nBoyd co-authored a 2009 study that documented pervasive deficiencies in correctional health care. He says that our approach to public health policy, especially toward the prison population, continues to suffer from a lack of empathy. \n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of sentiment in this country that there are undeserving people who are getting stuff for free that I have to pay for,\u201d he said. \u201cThat applies to poor people in this country who are not imprisoned and it no doubt applies to people who are imprisoned. It\u2019s just another way of stripping away rights.\u201d ALSO ON HUFFPOST The Most Humane Prison in the World? The Most Humane Prison in the World? 1 of 33 BASTOY ISLAND, HORTEN, NORWAY - APRIL 11: The former Bastoy Island lighthouse now used by the prison workers as a holiday retreat is seen in on April 11, 2011 in Bastoy Island, Horten, Norway. Bastoy Prison is a minimum security prison located on Bastoy Island, Norway, about 75 kilometers (46 mi) south of Oslo. The facility is located on a 2.6 square kilometer (1 sq mi) island and hosts 115 inmates. Arne Kvernvik Nilsen, governor of the prison, leads a staff of about 70 prison employees. Of this staff, only five employees remain on the island overnight. Once a prison colony for young boys, the facility now is trying to become 'the first eco-human prison in the world.' Inmates are housed in wooden cottages and work the prison farm. During their free time, inmates have access to horseback riding, fishing, tennis, and cross-country skiing.

Plant Closed, Havoc Followed", "text": " Photo Credit Patricia Wall/The New York Times JANESVILLE\nAn American Story\nBy Amy Goldstein\n351 pages. Simon & Schuster. $27.\nOver the course of his career, Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, has been described as a policy nerd, a lightweight, a canny tactician, a dreadful tactician, a man of principle and a man whose vertebrae have mysteriously gone missing .\nBut in the opening pages of \u201cJanesville: An American Story,\u201d Amy Goldstein\u2019s moving and magnificently well-researched ethnography of a small Wisconsin factory city on economic life support, Ryan is just another congressman, pleading on behalf of his hometown, population 63,000.\nIt\u2019s 2008, and Ryan has just received a phone call from Rick Wagoner, then the chairman and chief executive of General Motors, to alert him that the company will shortly be stopping all production in Janesville.\nThe news is too improbable to register. Janesville has a storied place in labor history, changing and repurposing itself as the times required. Barack Obama used its plant as a backdrop for a speech about the economy early on in his 2008 campaign. Most presidential candidates eventually buzz through . The place has been manufacturing Chevrolets for 85 years. The congressman is stunned.\nContinue reading the main story \u201cGive us Cavaliers,\u201d he begs. \u201cGive us pickups.\u201d Any model other than the unpopular SUVs the plant is currently churning out, he means. \u201cYou know you\u2019ll destroy this town if you do this!\u201d he yells into the phone.\nWhether the closure of this fabled 4.8-million-square-foot facility does or does not destroy Janesville is for the reader to decide. Goldstein , a longtime staff writer for The Washington Post who was part of a reporting team that won a Pulitzer Prize in 2002, opts for complexity over facile explanations and easy polemics. (Neither Obama nor Ryan comes off looking particularly good; and no, she does not conclude that these layoffs put Donald J. Trump in the White House.) Her book follows a clutch of characters over the course of five years, from 2008 to 2013, and concludes with an epilogue in the present, when unemployment in Janesville is less than 4 percent.\nTerrific news, you might say. But that number belies some harsh realities on the ground, as we learn throughout the book. Real wages in the town have fallen. Marriages have collapsed. And Janesville, a town with an unusual level of civic commitment, unity and native spirit \u2014 the Ryan family has been there for five generations \u2014 has capitulated to the same partisan rancor that afflicts the rest of the nation.\nPhoto Amy Goldstein Credit Melina Mara It was not the sort of place, for instance, where a beloved local politician might find someone unfurling his middle finger at him during Labor Fest \u2014 until 2011, which happened to be the year that Scott Walker, a flamboyantly anti-union and polarizing figure, took up residence in the governor\u2019s mansion. The town is now riven by \u201can optimism gap,\u201d as Goldstein calls it, with dispossessed workers on one side and bullish businesspeople on the other.\n\u201cJanesville\u201d joins a growing family of books about the evisceration of the working class in the United States. What sets it apart is the sophistication of its storytelling and analysis.\n The characters are especially memorable. This may be the first time since I began this job that I\u2019ve wanted to send notes of admiration to three people in a work of nonfiction.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Privacy Policy Readers will also finish \u201cJanesville\u201d with an extremely sobering takeaway: There\u2019s scant evidence that job retraining, possibly the sole item on the menu of policy options upon which Democrats and Republicans can agree, is at all effective.\nIn the case of the many laid-off workers in the Janesville area, the outcomes are decidedly worse for those who have attended the local technical college to learn a new trade. (Goldstein arrives at this conclusion, outlined in detail, by enlisting the help of local labor economists and poring over multiple data sets.) A striking number of dislocated G.M. employees don\u2019t even know how to use a computer when they first show up for classes at Blackhawk Technical College. \u201cSome students dropped out as soon as they found out that their instructors would not accept course papers written out longhand,\u201d Goldstein writes.\nIt makes you realize how challenging \u2014 and humiliating \u2014 it can be to reinvent oneself in midlife. To do so requires a kind of bravery for which no one gets a medal.\nBut perhaps the most powerful aspect of \u201cJanesville\u201d is its simple chronological structure, which allows Goldstein to show the chain reaction that something so calamitous as a plant closing can effect. Each falling domino becomes a headstone, signifying the death of the next thing.\nBecause the G.M. plant closes, so does the plant at the Lear Corporation, which supplied it with car seats and interiors. Because so many in Janesville are now out of work, nonprofits lose board members and contributions to local charities shrivel. Because their parents are out of work, students at Parker High start showing up for school both hungry and dirty. A social studies teacher starts the \u201cParker Closet,\u201d which provides them with food and supplies. (Deri Wahlert: She\u2019s one of the people to whom I\u2019d like to write a fan note.)\nThe fabric of hundreds of families unravels, as an itinerant class of fathers \u2014 \u201cJanesville Gypsies,\u201d they call themselves \u2014 start commuting to G.M. factories in Texas, Indiana and Kansas, just so they can maintain their wage of $28 an hour. Those who stay home invariably see their paychecks shrink drastically. One of the men Goldstein follows, Jerad Whiteaker, cycles through a series of unsatisfying, low-paying jobs, finally settling in one that pays less than half his former wage and offers no health insurance. His twin teenage girls \u2014 to whom I\u2019d also like to send awed notes \u2014 share five jobs between them, earning so much money for their family that they compromise their eligibility for student loans.\nYou will learn a lot about the arbitrary rules and idiosyncrasies of our government programs from this book. They have as many treacherous cracks and crevices as a glacier \u2014 and offer about as much warmth.\n\u201cJanesville\u201d is not without shortcomings. It can be overwhelming at first, with many characters raining down on the reader at once \u2014 it\u2019s a bit like getting caught in a hailstorm of pickup sticks. (Though there\u2019s a cheat sheet in the front of the book, which helps.) There\u2019s almost no discussion of globalization and outsourcing jobs to Mexico, which seems a strange omission. Surely, the residents of Janesville must have an opinion about this?\nBut these are minor objections, ultimately. \u201cJanesville\u201d is eye-opening, important, a diligent work of reportage.

Author of Injustices: SCOTUS\u2019 History of Comforting the Comfortable and Afflicting the Afflicted imillhiser@thinkprogress.org Apr 19 Trump picks anti-government extremist as his \u2018regulatory czar\u2019 Health, safety, and environmental regulations were nice, while we had them. The Trump administration, said White House chief strategist Stephen Bannon at a conservative political conference in February, is caught in a pitched battle for the \u201c deconstruction of the administrative state .\u201d For those wondering what, exactly, that means, they should pay attention to the woman Donald Trump just nominated to oversee his administration\u2019s entire regulatory apparatus. Neomi Rao is a former law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas and a professor at the law school that was recently renamed after the late conservative icon Antonin Scalia. She\u2019s also a leading conservative voice in favor of pushing the courts to tamp down on labor, environmental and other regulations advanced by agencies within the executive branch. Trump has, in other words, selected a regulatory czar who isn\u2019t just hostile towards regulation, but who wants to place permanent limits on future administrations\u2019 ability to regulate. Though many of the most radical changes she advocates would need to come through the courts and not the office she\u2019s been nominated to lead, if her views take hold it could become extraordinarily difficult for liberal presidents to govern even if they are swept into office with a commanding mandate. \u201cThe most important office in government you\u2019ve never heard of\u201d To explain, many federal laws lay out a broad policy goal, but delegate the task of determining many of the details of how to implement this goal to a federal agency. The Clean Air Act, for example, instructs the EPA to determine \u201c the best system of emission reduction \u201d that is both cost effective and feasible given existing technology, and to set standards ensuring that certain polluters achieve similar levels of reduction. Laws are drafted this way for several reasons . Agencies employ experts with deep knowledge on the subjects that they regulate, while Congress rarely possesses such granular knowledge. Congress is also a slow-moving body that, especially recently, has trouble performing very basic tasks like keeping the government open. But technology changes rapidly, as do prevailing business models within a regulated industry. Agencies are able to adapt relatively quickly to these changes to ensure that current policy still aligns with the goal announced by Congress. If Congress wants coal plants to use \u201cthe best system of emission reduction,\u201d for example, it cannot achieve this goal unless the regulations governing such plants adapt as new ways of reducing emissions are discovered. Each agency typically has its own officials who determine how and when to regulate, but the White House also has an office\u2014known as the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA)\u2014which oversees the entire regulatory process across nearly all federal agencies. Trump nominated Rao to lead up OIRA. Cass Sunstein, who led OIRA for much of the Obama administration, explains that OIRA plays at least as much of a role in coordinating information flow among agencies as it does in imposing its own views on particular regulations. Yet it is also the White House\u2019s primary voice in the regulatory process, and it plays a significant role in shaping regulations across issue areas. As Leah Litman and Ian Samuel write in a piece critical of Rao\u2019s nomination, OIRA is \u201coften called \u2018the most important office in government you\u2019ve never heard of .\u2019\u201d So who is Rao, exactly? Currently, Rao directs the Center for the Study of the Administrative State at George Mason University\u2019s Antonin Scalia Law School, a school which, as its name implies, is a haven for conservative legal thinkers. The Charles Koch Foundation recently gave Scalia Law School a $10 million grant, and the school employs a bevy of libertarian law professors who are hostile towards the regulatory state and who\u2019ve offered novel theories aimed at weakening or dismantling it altogether. thinkprogress.org Rao authored a law review article calling on the courts to revive a largely defunct doctrine known as \u201cnondelegation,\u201d which could potentially impose strict limits on Congress\u2019 ability to delegate regulatory power to agencies. Though her article is noncommittal regarding just how strictly she would limit this ability, Rao praises her former boss Justice Thomas, who said agencies should be forbidden from making \u201cgenerally applicable rules of private conduct.\u201d Under Thomas\u2019 framework, laws like the Clean Air Act simply cannot exist, as their entire structure depends upon enabling agency experts to issue binding rules upon regulated industries. Indeed, it is questionable whether the United States would even be capable of enacting an effective environmental policy under Thomas\u2019 framework. Rao\u2019s argument for reviving the nondelegation doctrine is a bit complex, but it boils down to a counterintuitive claim that allowing agencies to regulate gives individual members of Congress too much power. Congress, Rao writes, is supposed to operate as a \u201ccollective.\u201d That is, no individual member of Congress has any constitutional authority\u200a\u2014\u200aeach lawmaker can only act by joining together with a majority of their colleagues in both houses of Congress to enact a law. The existence of regulatory agencies, Rao claims, subverts this design by enabling individual members of Congress to wield their influence over federal agencies. A lawmaker can use \u201ccommittee oversight, threats to reduce appropriations, investigations of administrative conduct, reporting requirements, and the confirmation process for high-level officials,\u201d as well as informal methods such as communication with agency officials, in order to influence that agency\u2019s regulatory process. In order to prevent individual lawmakers from influencing agencies in this way, and to restore a system where Congress only acts collectively, Rao proposes that the courts should impose new limits on Congress\u2019 ability to delegate authority to agencies. It\u2019s an interesting, if fundamentally flawed, argument. Among other things, it\u2019s not at all clear why granting more power to the courts is a solution to what Rao believes to be too-powerful agencies influenced by too-powerful individual lawmakers. Members of Congress do not simply seek to influence the regulatory process, they routinely file briefs seeking to influence judicial decisions. Lawmakers can also threaten courts with reduced appropriations, jurisdiction stripping , and even court-packing . It is unavoidable that individual lawmakers will try to exert their influence over the other branches of government, and transferring power from the executive to the judiciary will do nothing to stop that\u200a\u2014\u200aeven if stopping it were a desirable goal. Can Rao be stopped? Rao\u2019s scholarship suggests that she will be an eager general in Trump\u2019s war on the administrative state. But the particular arguments she\u2019s advanced in the course of that scholarship at least raise the possibility that her nomination can be defeated. After all, Rao\u2019s core argument is that members of Congress\u200a\u2014\u200aincluding the senators who will decide whether or not to confirm her\u200a\u2014\u200ashould lose influence. That\u2019s not an argument that\u2019s likely to please many senators. As Rao notes, our current system enables members of Congress to attempt to \u201c \u2018rescue\u2019 constituents from regulatory burdens \u201d by raising concerns with the agency responsible for imposing said burden. Some of these rescue efforts are taken on behalf of deserving constituents, frustrated that their concerns went unheard by an agency. Others are taken on behalf of well-moneyed interests savvy enough to hire the right lobbyist. Either way, a lawmaker\u2019s ability to attempt these rescue efforts are quite valuable to that lawmaker. And yet, one of Rao\u2019s central scholarly projects is stripping lawmakers\u2019 ability to serve their constituents in this way. To defeat Rao, at least three Republican senators will need to cross over to vote against her nomination. It is unlikely they will be moved to do so because of ideological objections to her anti-regulatory agency, but they might be convinced to do so in order to preserve their own ability to influence the federal regulatory process. By nominating Rao, Trump seemingly announced his desire to shut senators out of the room where it happens in each federal agency. Perhaps enough of those senators will object to that announcement to scuttle her nomination.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cass sunstein", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ian samuel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antonin scalia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephen bannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clarence thomas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "neomi rao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leah litman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "office of information and regulatory affairs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antonin scalia law school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "administrative state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charles koch foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "epa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scalia law school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george mason university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oira", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-20T00:40:19.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "6887693a80bcf62ceb69da2ab3c9509000224c44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxTqL_zg0lpoTppy8cE3lF89DX6zjvDrJ0i2U.RLnNkJ.U..24BI9ajLGuHSYWFHe6", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "site": "nytimes.com", "site_section": "https://www.nytimes.com/svc/collections/v1/publish/http://www.nytimes.com/section/science/earth/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Environment", "title": "Asteroid Misses Earth Narrowly, by Cosmic Standards", "title_full": "Asteroid Misses Earth Narrowly, by Cosmic Standards", "published": "2017-04-19T21:47:55.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/19/science/20xp-asteroid/20xp-asteroid-facebookJumbo.jpg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 98, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 994, "comments": 0, "shares": 994}, "gplus": {"shares": 4}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 13}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6887693a80bcf62ceb69da2ab3c9509000224c44", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxTqL_zg0lpoTppy8cE3lF89DX6zjvDrJ0i2U.RLnNkJ.U..24BI9ajLGuHSYWFHe6", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JONAH ENGEL BROMWICH", "published": "2017-04-19T21:47:55.000+03:00", "title": "Asteroid Misses Earth Narrowly, by Cosmic Standards", "text": "Privacy Policy Congress gave NASA the task of tracking all large objects that come within any reasonable range of Earth.

NASA, using statistical analysis, projects that there are somewhere between 25,000 and 26,000 asteroids in that category, though it has identified only about 7,700 thus far. \u201cThat\u2019s the current program objective, although we know that asteroids smaller than that, were they to impact, could do significant damage to a citywide area,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, of NASA.

But the agency still takes the time to run drills preparing for such a contingency . Mr. Johnson, who has been working on the problem for NASA since 2003 and became its first planetary defense officer about 15 months ago, said that NASA has proposed a mission concept for how such asteroids would be deflected while still in space, called a kinetic impact technique. Two spacecraft would be called upon to nudge an asteroid called Didymos, changing the speed of its orbit as a test of the way a threatening asteroid might be dealt with in the future. \u201cYou only need to change the velocity of the asteroid by a hair, just a centimeter per second,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cIf you do that a few years in advance of impact time, it will make it miss instead of hit the Earth.\u201d That test would take place in 2022.

Chukwuemeka Ezeugo, popularly known as \u2018Reverend King\u2019 as well as other murder convicts in the state. \nIn a question and answer session with newsmen, at the flag off of the yearly ministerial briefing of the Lagos State Ministry of Justice, the Attorney General and Commissioner for Justice, Mr Adeniji Kazeem, said the decision becomes imperative with the briefing coming from the prisons authorities regarding the condemned inmates in the state. General Overseer of the Christian Praying Assembly, Rev. Chukwuemeka Ezeugo, a.k.a Reverend King \nThe Supreme Court recently, affirmed both the judgments of the trial court and the appeal court which convicted and sentenced Ezeugo to death by hanging for the murder of his church member, Ann Uzoh on January 17, 2007. \nThe State Commissioner for Justice said it has become necessary for the government to look at the issues considering that some convicts on death row are beginning to demand for certain rights, since they feel that no action will be taken towards their execution. \n\u201cThis government is very strong on law and order. And the case is one of those that is under review. Like him, many others are on death row. And very soon, residents of Lagos will see the action of the government on it. \n\u201cThere are lots of people on death row. There are some states that have been active in enforcing the judgement. I know that many had zeroed in on Rev King. I discussed his issues actively with the prison authority during my recent prison visit and it was on the instruction of Governor Akinwunmi Ambode. That shows it is a sensitive issue. \n\u201cI have given you indication that we are moving towards that direction. The previous governors of this state have not signed the papers of any of those on death row. But the prison authority had informed that some of the convicts are beginning to think they have some rights. We are going to move in that direction, you will hear from me,\u201d he added. \nBeside, he elaborated that the government has re-opened the case of Hamzat Al Mustapha, who was allegedly fingered in the murder of the late Kudirat Abiola at the Supreme Court. \nHe said ministry through its directorate of legislative drafting and the Law Reforms Commission have been involved in the drafting, amendment and reforms of laws and regulations sponsored in collaboration with the House of Assembly and other Ministries Departments and Agencies, MDAs. \nHe noted that a total of 14 bills were passed into law while 12 are currently undergoing drafting process, emphasising that those laws enacted have impacted positively in the lives of residence. \nHe listed the laws to include the Lagos State Employment Trust Fund law, 2016, Kidnapping Law, 2016, State Environmental Protection and Management Law 2017 among others.

ADVERTISEMENT \n\u201cThe new version of Google Earth is really about education, it\u2019s really about immersing yourself in places you haven\u2019t been before to get a little bit of an exposure,\u201d he added. \nOnline explorers cruising the mobile version of Earth can also capture pictures on their travels, sending friends digital postcards. \nNew Earth was launched on Google\u2019s Chrome and Android software, with versions tailored for Apple devices and other internet browsing software promised soon. \nIt\u2019s the first time that Earth can be reached on a web browser instead of through applications installed on devices. \nThe move allows Google to tap into more powerful computing power at data centers in the internet \u201ccloud\u201d instead of relying on the capabilities of smartphones and other devices.

(AP) \u2014 A man wanted in the slaying of a security guard set out to kill as many white people as he could on Tuesday, gunning down three men on the streets of downtown Fresno before he was captured and admitted to the shootings, authorities said. Kori Ali Muhammad, 39, was arrested shortly after the morning rampage that left three white men dead, police said. Muhammad, who is black, fired 16 rounds in less than two minutes at four places within a block, shooting men who appeared to be going about their day, authorities say.\nDuring his arrest, Muhammad shouted \"Allahu Akbar,\" but Fresno Police Chief Jerry Dyer said the shootings had \"nothing to do with terrorism in spite of the statement he made.\"\n\"This is solely based on race,\" Dyer told reporters.\nMuhammad on Tuesday first walked up to a utility truck and shot a Pacific Gas & Electric Co. employee sitting in the passenger seat. The driver of the truck, who is Latino, sped off to the police department for help, but the worker, a 34-year-old white man, died.\nMuhammad then shot at another person and missed, police said. He aimed at a third, killing the 37-year-old on the sidewalk as he walked with a bag of groceries. The final victim, 58, was gunned down in the parking lot of a charity building, authorities said.\nDyer said Muhammad approached a vehicle in between shootings, but he spared the lives of two Latina women who were in the car with a child.\n\"These were unprovoked attacks by an individual that was intent on carrying out homicides today. He did that,\" Dyer said.\nPolice had put out a news release hours before the shootings Tuesday, saying that Muhammad was armed and dangerous and wanted in the shooting death of a security guard at a Motel 6 last week. The guard, 25-year-old Carl Williams, was white.\nMuhammad told officers at his arrest that he was the guy they were looking for, Dyer said.\n\"I did it. I shot them,\" Dyer said Muhammad told officers.\nPolice are searching for the revolver Muhammad said he tossed into a pile of clothing. The gun may have been picked up by someone else, Dyer said.\nMuhammad faces four counts of murder and at least two additional charges of assault with a deadly weapon.\nStephen Hughes, 66, said he and his wife rushed home Tuesday after receiving a frantic call from a neighbor. Hughes came home to see a body draped in a blanket on the sidewalk leading to his front door.\nHe first thought the shooting was gang-related, but then he noticed the bag of groceries near the body. \"It looks like a guy carrying his groceries home from the store,\" Hughes said.\nOn what appeared to be Muhammad's Facebook page, he repeatedly posted \"#LetBlackPeopleGo\" and encouraged \"black warriors\" to \"mount up.\" A flurry of posts emerged in the past day.\nHe wrote that his \"kill rate increases tremendously on the other side\" and also posted about \"white devils.\" On several occasions, he wrote updates that included the phrase \"Allahu Akbar,\" meaning \"God is great\" in Arabic.\nMuhammad has a criminal history that includes arrests on weapons, drugs and false imprisonment charges and making terrorist threats. He had been associated with gangs but he was not a confirmed member, police say.\nMuhammad was charged in 2005 with possessing cocaine with intent to distribute, court records show. Federal prosecutors said at the time that he was also in possession of a 9mm semi-automatic handgun and two rifles after being convicted of a felony.\nHe claimed insanity, and his attorney requested a psychiatric examination for his client, saying Muhammad \"appeared eccentric with some bizarre beliefs.\" A psychiatrist who examined Muhammad believed he had psychosis, Muhammad's attorney said in the court filing.\nHe also \"suffered auditory hallucinations and had at least two prior mental health hospitalizations,\" according to court documents. His attorney said that Muhammad had \"paranoia\" and thought the justice system and his defense attorney were conspiring against him, court papers said.\nThe attorney who represented Muhammad in that case did not return a call for comment Tuesday.\nPublic records list Muhammad as Cory Taylor and other aliases with addresses in Fresno and Sacramento. Fresno's police chief said his former name was Cory McDonald. A woman who identified herself as Taylor's grandmother said Tuesday that the family last saw him on Easter Sunday. She hung up the phone before giving her name.\n\"I never would have thought he would do anything like this,\" sad Muhammad's brother, who asked not to be identified by name. \"I'm just kind of shocked.\"\nHe described his brother as a funny and intelligent man.\nPolice say two of the victims may have been clients of Catholic Charities, which provides a variety of services for refugees, the homeless and those with disabilities.\n___\nContributing to this report are Associated Press writers Sophia Bollag in Fresno; Kristin J.

Gareth Copley/Reuters \nStop waiting for happiness and success\u200a\u2014\u200ayou can start achieving them in the present by giving up these toxic things. When we aim to become happy and have a successful outlook, we often focus on getting to the next station in life. \nHappiness is seemingly always \"someday\" in the near-distant future\u200a\u2014\u200alike once we finally land that promotion or find the right partner. I'm a huge proponent of setting new aspirational goals , but I also know the severe importance of having a positive outlook on life. \nYour inner-happiness needs to be harnessed in the present, so you can use the power of positive thinking to reach those new heights eventually. When you solely focus on the future to be happy, you end up ignoring the toxic habits and attitudes that could be dragging it down in the present. It won't be a cakewalk, but it is possible to harness a successful and upbeat outlook now with some shifts to your mindsets and habits. Without further ado, here are those things you need to give up to be happy and successful: 1. Give up FOMO \n\"Business opportunities are like buses,\" said Richard Branson . \"There's always another one coming.\" If you're constantly inundated by the fear of missing out (FOMO) you won't only be less happy, but you'll end up adopting a short-term outlook and spread yourself too thin. Mega-moguls like Branson know that they have limited resources and time, so they carefully evaluate each opportunity that presents itself. Rather than feeling guilty or sad because they turned down an opportunity, they stay happy and sane knowing another one is right around the corner. 2. Give up unrealistic standards of perfection While you should never deliver sloppy work or make careless mistakes, expecting yourself to be perfect 24/7 is another unrealistic attitude you need to give up. \nAs Sheryl Sandberg once wisely asked, \"What would you do if you weren't afraid?\" You'll never be able to leave your comfort zone and expand your success to new horizons if you don't give yourself permission to make a few slip-ups along the way. The ultra-successful are able to redefine failure as part of the learning experience to achieve positive outlooks, and you should too. 3. Give up on expecting praise from others I'm sorry to be the one to break this to you, but nobody will take the time to shower you with praise. That's why you have to do it yourself. Most people in business will only set aside their precious minutes if they see you doing something wrong, or if they want something from you. Sprinkling your ego with dew drops of praise is the furthest thing from their minds. You're doing great things, so take the time to recognize it. By 5:00 every day, write down three things that you accomplished. They don't have to be life-changing, just good things that deserve recognition. Re-read yesterday's entry every morning. If you're feeling low on confidence you can read through a couple of weeks' worth of your many successes and gain confidence and perspective. Psychologists call this journaling, and it's a proven way to boost your happiness. Start using it today. 4. Give up on negative self-talk Studies estimate that we say 300 to 1,000 words to ourselves every single minute . If you engage in negative self-talk, that's a lot of nasty words being thrown your way. That's why none other than the U.S. Navy SEALs swear by positive self-talk as a way to take on a strenuous day, and to avoid negativity. When their oxygen flow is suddenly cut off underwater , SEALs are able to tough it out by telling themselves that everything is fine and thinking positively. So you can probably also use this tip to get through a day at the office. To start, tell yourself how great your day is going to be as you're riding the subway or driving down the freeway. If you start encountering a rough morning, go outside for a few minutes and repeat some more positive affirmations to yourself. 5. Give up on being defensive Raise your hand if you just love getting feedback and critiques. No one? Okay, so maybe hearing criticism is a little difficult for all of us. But, in order to become more successful, it's necessary. And, to become radically successful, you may even need to start asking for feedback. Forbes found a strong correlation between leaders who asked for feedback and leaders ranked highest for effectiveness . Leaders who were in the lower 10% of people who asked for feedback were only ranked as 17% effective by their peers and employees. Meanwhile, leaders who were in the top 10% of people who asked for feedback received an average effectiveness rating of 83%. Rather than fearing feedback and defending any critiques, try to be curious of how others view your performance. This curiosity and the process of asking for feedback can be difficult, but ultimately it will provide insight that could be the difference between reaching your goals and falling short. 6. Give up the scarcity mindset A scarcity mindset is the belief that there's only so much success to go around. In this age of hyper-competitiveness, thinking that someone else's victory \"steals\" from your own success creeps on almost everyone. \nStephen Covey, the author of \"7 Habits of Highly Effective People,\" said, \"Instead, I have an abundance mentality: When people are genuinely happy at the successes of others, the pie gets larger.\" People like Covey see an opportunity in everything, and they don't believe that someone else's success eats away at their own. Whether it's collaborating with others in the field, elevating your teammates, or just saying \"why not?\" you too can start adopting that same abundance mindset , this very second. 7. Give up on being set in stone Being determined and motivated is great. But don't fall into the trap of mistaking determination for an unwillingness to change. Take Jeffery Hazlet, former CMO of Kodak, for instance. When he realized no amount of his sheer will would turn Kodak into the business he wanted, he shifted that determination elsewhere. Now he's a New York Times best-selling author , keynote speaker, and media mogul. First business models or career plans rarely pan out, but successful people don't keep running towards defeat when that happens. Even if your plan fails, it can still have an impact. By modifying it, you can make it successful, even if it isn't what you originally intended. 8. Give up the short-term mindset \n\"Don't make a permanent decision from your temporary emotion.\"\u200a \u2014 \u200aUnknown In my many years in finance, I've seen people t hrow decades of financial planning out the window because of their emotions. And it's beyond easy to do this in a stressful workplace too. When successful people find themselves in situations where they're extremely angry, sad, or frustrated, they let themselves ride out those emotions without acting on them. The simple act of waiting to make a decision until you've returned to a levelheaded state can play a huge role in the success you achieve. 9. Give up on the negativity of others Just like a bad cold, negativity can be incredibly contagious. Although it might temporarily feel good to listen to others venting, don't regret wallowing in a pity party. While it's nearly impossible to rid negative thoughts, people and situations altogether (we'll always have good and bad days), we can choose to strip away the parts our life that bring us down and instead refocus that energy towards being the best versions of ourselves. You can and should choose to surround yourself with passionate, motivated, and aspirational people. I do, and I know it challenges me (instead of dragging me down) daily. 10. Give up comparison \n\"Comparison is the thief of joy\" \u200a\u2014 \u200aTheodore Roosevelt If you are in the habit of comparing yourself to others, and a big majority of us are, it's time to stop. There will always be someone ahead of you, but the game of life is a marathon, not a sprint. Whether you are feeling bad because you think your peers are doing better than you, or you are building yourself up based on their failures, both are unproductive and have the potential to be self-destructive. 11. Give up self-doubt Even when all the signs are pointing towards success, insecurity can easily kill your dreams. In fact, it's so prevalent (especially with successful people), that it's a full-blown condition known as Impostor Syndrome. To start breaking this nasty habit: Create a list of your skills, talents, and achievements. Read the list regularly and when you're plagued by self-doubt , remind yourself of all the reasons you're \"good enough.\" Don't underestimate the power of positive thinking and ditching negativity in your life. Make giving up on these habits a part of your Spring Cleaning, and you'll be amazed at how far you eventually get. \nElle Kaplan is the Founder and CEO of LexION Capital , a fiduciary wealth management firm in New York City serving high-net-worth individuals.

Start by asking friends and relatives for recommendations \u2014 if people you trust are happy with their travels, Mr. Kolner said, chances are you will be, too. You can also ask for recommendations on Facebook. In addition, Virtuoso has a catalog on its site of 4,000 advisers; you can search by geographic location, areas of specialization and languages spoken. Other travel networks with agents include the American Society of Travel Agents , the Signature Travel Network and American Express Travel . You can also check out reviews of agents through a Google or Bing search or sites like Yelp.\nFIGURING OUT YOUR NEEDS Do you want someone who is a specialist in a particular destination to assist with planning one specific trip, such as a gorilla trekking adventure in Rwanda? Or are you looking for someone who can help plan your travel for years to come, effectively someone who becomes a specialist in you? These can be the same person, Mr. Kolner said, but knowing what you want from the outset may lead you to a different adviser.\nHOW INVOLVED DO YOU WANT TO BE? Some advisers like to plan every aspect of a trip, from booking airfare to making dinner reservations, while some are happy to offer a second opinion about your own research. Some prefer phone interaction, while others are comfortable conversing via email or text. It\u2019s important, Mr. Kolner said, to work with an adviser who matches your travel planning personality. You can find out if advisers are happy to hold your hand or leave you alone by asking them directly. \u201cYou\u2019ll find that most are forthcoming about their communication style and travel planning process,\u201d he said.\nDON\u2019T BE SCARED OFF BY FEES It\u2019s not uncommon for advisers to charge a fee for their services, which could range from $50 to several hundred dollars, depending on the complexity of the trip. Mr. Kolner said charging fees was a growing practice because advisers spent several hours planning their clients\u2019 trips and would have difficulty making a sustainable living without being compensated for their time. \u201cYou are paying for an adviser\u2019s knowledge and for the perks they\u2019re able to score for you,\u201d he said.

Credit NASA/JPL-Caltech \u201cWe\u2019re safe. From this one.\u201d\nThat was a Quote: from NASA \u2019s planetary defense officer, Lindley Johnson, after a large asteroid soared narrowly \u2014 by cosmic standards \u2014 past the Earth on Wednesday morning, the closest approach by such an object in more than a decade, according to scientists at NASA.\nThe asteroid, discovered three years ago and known by astronomers as 2014 JO25, is approximately 2,000 feet end-to-end, larger than the Willis Tower in Chicago, though its unusual shape made it its size difficult to assess before it passed. It was about 1.1 million miles away from Earth \u2014 about 4.6 times the distance between Earth and the moon \u2014 when it passed by at about 8:30 a.m. Eastern time.\nJO25 \u2014 which some enthusiasts have nicknamed \u201cThe Rock\u201d after the actor Dwayne Johnson \u2014 approached from the direction of the sun. It will be visible through telescopes for several nights.\nThe last time a similarly sized asteroid passed within such a close distance was September 2004, when Toutatis, a 3.1 mile-long asteroid, came within four lunar distances of Earth.\nIt is the first time in four centuries that JO25 has been so close to the planet, and the asteroid will not come within a similar distance for another 500 years, NASA said in a news release .\nGet the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.\n Congress gave NASA the task of tracking all large objects that come within any reasonable range of Earth. The agency\u2019s Near-Earth Object Observations Program tracks any object that is 140 meters (about 460 feet) or larger that comes within five million miles of the Earth. NASA, using statistical analysis, projects that there are somewhere between 25,000 and 26,000 asteroids in that category, though it has identified only about 7,700 thus far.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the current program objective, although we know that asteroids smaller than that, were they to impact, could do significant damage to a citywide area,\u201d said Mr. Johnson, of NASA. He added that the criteria would keep the agency focused on asteroids that could wipe out a region the size of a state.\n Scientists at NASA have said that such large asteroids have no significant chance of hitting Earth within the next hundred years. But the agency still takes the time to run drills preparing for such a contingency .\nMr. Johnson, who has been working on the problem for NASA since 2003 and became its first planetary defense officer about 15 months ago, said that NASA has proposed a mission concept for how such asteroids would be deflected while still in space, called a kinetic impact technique. Two spacecraft would be called upon to nudge an asteroid called Didymos, changing the speed of its orbit as a test of the way a threatening asteroid might be dealt with in the future.\n\u201cYou only need to change the velocity of the asteroid by a hair, just a centimeter per second,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cIf you do that a few years in advance of impact time, it will make it miss instead of hit the Earth.\u201d\nThat test would take place in 2022.\nCorrection: April 19, 2017\nAn earlier version of this article gave an outdated name for Chicago\u2019s Sears Tower.

(Photo: Noam Galai/WireImage) More Vanessa Hudgens (aka the unofficial Queen of Coachella ) can do her own makeup, thank you very much. Though she\u2019s a Hollywood star, the 28-year-old triple threat doesn\u2019t travel with a glam squad and likes to keep her beauty routine simple. Yes, when she has big events, she enlists a team, but for the day-to-day stuff, she\u2019s got it all under control. \u201cI normally just throw on concealer under my eyes and on a few spots on my chin and nose,\u201d she told Yahoo Celebrity. \u201cI use a bronzer from Bare Minerals and kind of buff it out.\u201d There is one beauty trick that\u2019s an absolute must, however.\n\u201cI\u2019m big on brushing out your eyebrows,\u201d revealed Hudgens, who recently partnered with EcoTools to launch the #MyTrueBeauty campaign. Although she gets her brows professionally shaped only once a year, she grooms them on the regular. \u201cEcoTools has a brow brush that I love. I think it\u2019s so important because they really frame your face. You brush your hair, so it makes sense that you should brush your eyebrows!\u201d Her eyebrows are pretty on-point.\nOn the other side of things, the trend that Hudgens can\u2019t stand is extreme contouring. \u201cI think the way God made you is just what makes you beautiful and unique, and you need to embrace that and not try to put on someone else\u2019s face,\u201d she explained. That said, while plastic surgery isn\u2019t for her (at least not anytime soon), she thinks everyone \u201cshould follow their own bliss.\u201d\nSpeaking of following one\u2019s bliss, Hudgens just spent a weekend at Coachella, where she continued to impress with her flawless festival style. ( She\u2019s been a mainstay there for ages .) More impressive still is the fact that she doesn\u2019t plan her outfits in advance. \u201cI kind of go with a rough idea, just so I\u2019m not scrambling and so that I have everything that I need, but it\u2019s mainly whatever I feel like for that day \u2014 plus a lot of glitter!\u201d she laughed. \u201cI bring a ton of rhinestones to glue onto my face and just all that fun stuff.\u201d Also, a giant Chanel backpack never hurt anyone.\nLast weekend, however, she had a packing fail when she realized she didn\u2019t bring any hair accessories. \u201cI brought all my hair products and everything, but I wished that I had brought some leather to wrap around my pigtails and a couple of little daisy clips that I could have clipped in there as well,\u201d she lamented.\nShe also went with \u201calmost an entirely new group\u201d of people this year. To be clear, though, it was all people she knew well \u2014 just not people she\u2019d attended Coachella with before. \u201cI try to only go with people I\u2019m already really close with because it can be stressful keeping everyone together and making sure you\u2019re all enjoying the same music,\u201d she explained. \u201cSo I\u2019m like, \u2018Unless we\u2019re already close, we\u2019re not going to Coachella together.'\u201d (ICYMI: She took to Instagram to share a snapshot of her Coachella \u201cfamily,\u201d and they definitely look like a fun crew.)\nPart of the stress no doubt comes from the fact that Hudgens has designated herself as the main organizer and schedule-keeper for the event. \u201cI\u2019m like the mom,\u201d she said with a laugh. \u201cI make sure everyone\u2019s fine. I say, \u2018This is what we\u2019re doing.\u2019 I\u2019m pretty go-with-the-flow, but I think that for the most part I know who\u2019s going to be the best people to see, and for the most part my friends listen.\u201d\nHudgens admits that for some people, Coachella has become all about the scene, but that\u2019s not the case for her. \u201cI think that in any situation, you create your own experience. It\u2019s whatever you focus your energy and attention to, so if you\u2019re focusing on the scene of it, of course that\u2019s all you\u2019re going to see,\u201d she reasoned. \u201cFor me, I love music festivals because of the music; I\u2019m such a musically driven person. I always have been and always will be, so any opportunity I have to get all of my friends together to enjoy some incredible artists where we\u2019re all barefoot on the grass \u2014 there\u2019s nothing better.\u201d\nThe highlight this time around was Radiohead. \u201cTheir sound actually cut out a few times, and a lot of people left and a couple of my friends were like, \u2018We should go\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Hell, no! We are staying this out!'\u201d she recalled. \u201cI\u2019m so glad we did, because by the end of it, almost everyone had left and me and my sister were arm-in-arm, mooning over Jonny Greenwood and Thom Yorke. They played \u2018Creep,\u2019 which they never ever play. They finished the song and Thom kept strumming the chords, and before I knew it the entire audience was singing \u2018Creep,\u2019 and it was just one of those magical Coachella experiences.\u201d\n\u2022 Melissa Etheridge: \u2018I\u2019d Much Rather Have a Smoke With My Grown Kids Than a Drink\u2019\n\u2022 Jim Carrey Joins the Crazy-Man Beard Club\n\u2022 Jessica Simpson\u2019s Family Photos: Party of Four!", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/9.7BITuNvLVHvh7x.SlEaw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NzYw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/dfd700805b25f9711e5dabd72af4e796"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "coachella vanessa hudgens", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "vanessa hudgens", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "noam galai/wir", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "jim carrey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonny greenwood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jessica simpson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hudgens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melissa etheridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "radiohead", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thom yorke", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "chanel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crazy-man beard club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yahoo celebrity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ecotools", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coachella", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-19T22:06:11.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "63b67f8b210a04afa0c7dcb45918251deea8a2bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOj8PAwxqJiDtQUYSEU9.vWN6Xaocrk8jWdBTHyl0imLMcMCaGCW.lo541daiMvHcsZroa3A1eJwkO55vpRjjPyLfScMiXeZViFpx1j49FwkYYIPs5pf7__FzuJT3O9.CHs-", "site_full": "www.huffingtonpost.com", "site": "huffingtonpost.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Google Doodle Honors Ghanaian Entrepreneur Esther Afua Ocloo | The Huffington Post", "title_full": "Google Doodle Honors Ghanaian Entrepreneur Esther Afua Ocloo | The Huffington Post", "published": "2017-04-19T00:39:13.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.032, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 139, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 992, "comments": 2, "shares": 992}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "63b67f8b210a04afa0c7dcb45918251deea8a2bf", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOj8PAwxqJiDtQUYSEU9.vWN6Xaocrk8jWdBTHyl0imLMcMCaGCW.lo541daiMvHcsZroa3A1eJwkO55vpRjjPyLfScMiXeZViFpx1j49FwkYYIPs5pf7__FzuJT3O9.CHs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Zeba Blay", "published": "2017-04-19T00:39:13.000+03:00", "title": "Google Doodle Honors Ghanaian Entrepreneur Esther Afua Ocloo | The Huffington Post", "text": "04/18/2017 01:23 pm ET | Updated 22 hours ago Google Doodle Honors Ghanaian Entrepreneur Esther Afua Ocloo Ocloo was a business pioneer and champion of low-income women. Tuesday's Google Doodle. 3.5k \nThe life and work of Esther Afua Ocloo has been celebrated in the latest Google Doodle , on what would have been the businesswoman\u2019s 98th birthday. \nOn Tuesday, an illustration of Ocloo appeared on the Google search engine\u2019s front page, depicting the Ghana native\u2019s pioneering work.

More With the simple submission of a technical sanctions waiver, oil giant Exxon Mobil created a potential PR headache for the White House. On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported Exxon is seeking a greenlight from the U.S. government to bypass sanctions on Russia and resume doing business with the country\u2019s state-owned oil giant Rosneft. It\u2019s hard to imagine how the optics could be worse. One of the biggest of the many scandals plaguing Trump\u2019s White House is the FBI investigation into whether his campaign coordinated with Russian intelligence to tip the election in his favor. An unverified dossier alleges that Rosneft may have played a role in the Russian election meddling. And Secretary of State Rex Tillerson happens to be the former Exxon CEO \u2014 who before becoming America\u2019s top diplomat had lobbied the Obama administration to ease sanctions that hamstrung Exxon\u2019s business in Russia. The State Department is one of several government agencies that will oversee Exxon\u2019s waiver application, though a State Department spokesman told the Wall Street Journal Tillerson (who received the Russian Order of Friendship in 2013) is recusing himself from any decisions relating to Exxon for two years. The sanctions were put in place in 2014, after Russia annexed Crimea. The sanctions prevent U.S. companies from dealings with Rosneft involving technology transfer, and also target Rosneft chief \u2014 and Putin confidant \u2014 Igor Sechin. Under Tillerson\u2019s leadership, Exxon paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to lobbying groups to argue against U.S. sanctions and he personally met with senior Obama White House officials a dozen times to discuss sanctions on Russia (though he assured Congressional leaders at his confirmation hearing in January he \u201cnever lobbied against sanctions personally\u201d and \u201cto [his] knowledge, Exxon never directly lobbied against sanctions.\u201d) Exxon figures the sanctions, which have forestalled exploration in places like the Russian Arctic, cost it at least $1 billion. Exxon is apparently trying to get U.S. permission to drill in the Russian Black Sea; if it doesn\u2019t drill an exploratory well this year, it could lose the concession. But existing sanctions aside, Exxon\u2019s efforts now to get access to deepwater, offshore oil fields is a little curious given the big global oil supply glut and still-cheap prices. Deepwater projects, like the one Exxon is trying to get going, generally need oil prices closer to $70 a barrel to be economic; crude oil has spent months in the $50 a barrel range. (Exxon\u2019s other sanctions-stalled project with Rosneft, in the chilly Kara Sea, would be an even dicier proposition at these prices.) But under the terms of its agreement with Rosneft, Exxon\u2019s Black Sea play could expire if it doesn\u2019t act soon, so it presumably wants to keep the proverbial pilot light on so they\u2019re ready to pounce when prices rebound. Another reason could be sheer competitive pressure. The European Union is granting sanctions waivers to its own companies, including Italian oil company Eni, to explore cooperation with Russia in the Black and Barents Seas, even while the sanctions freeze out U.S. firms. \u201cExxon is worried it could get boxed out of the Black Sea by the Italians,\u201d one person briefed on the Exxon waiver told the Journal.

(Photo: Getty Images) More Cannabinoids, the chemical compounds in marijuana , have been studied by the medical community for help with treating nausea, pain, and anorexia, among other issues. Now researchers say cannabinoids can help with an entirely new area: skin diseases.\nThat\u2019s the takeaway from an April 2017 study published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology , which discovered that the anti-inflammatory properties in cannabinoids make them useful for treating eczema , psoriasis , and atopic and contact dermatitis.\nFor the study, researchers analyzed medical literature and found that cannabinoids largely help with itching. In one study, for example, eight out of 21 patients who used a cannabinoid cream twice a day for three weeks completely eliminated severe itching. (Scientists say cannabinoids might have reduced the dry skin that caused the itch.)\nThe study\u2019s senior author, Robert Dellavalle, MD, an associate professor of dermatology at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said in a press release that cannabinoid creams and treatments may be effective because they\u2019re anti-inflammatory. In the studies Dellavalle reviewed, he and his colleagues discovered that THC \u2014 the active ingredient in marijuana \u2014 reduced skin swelling and inflammation in mice. \u201cThese are topical cannabinoid drugs with little or no psychotropic effect that can be used for skin disease,\u201d he said.\nIt\u2019s difficult to study cannabinoids in the U.S. because of marijuana\u2019s classification by the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) as a Schedule I substance, which places it in \u201cthe most dangerous class of drugs\u201d \u2014 along with heroin, LSD, and ecstasy \u2014 and makes all forms of marijuana illegal under federal law. In order to study the plant, researchers must obtain a special license from the DEA. Researchers in the latest study stress that their conclusions were based on laboratory models, not large-scale clinical trials, owing to the difficulty of actually performing them with marijuana.\nBut Joshua Zeichner , MD, a New York City dermatologist and director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Medical Center (who did not work on the study), tells Yahoo Beauty that there is a growing body of research that supports the use of cannabinoids, including cannabis oil, in treating skin conditions ranging from eczema to acne . \u201cCannabis oil has many benefits for the skin,\u201d he says. \u201cIt contains high levels of fatty acids, which help hydrate and repair damaged skin.\u201d It may even help regulate oil production in the skin, he adds.\nUnlike marijuana in its whole form, the cannabis oil used in skin care products doesn\u2019t give users a high because it doesn\u2019t contain significant levels of THC, says Zeichner, who recommends the skin care product.\nGary Goldenberg , MD, medical director of the dermatology faculty practice at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City, tells Yahoo Beauty that cannabinoids can be added to topical creams to decrease inflammation and soothe skin, as well as help with wound healing.\nGoldenberg says he doesn\u2019t have any concerns about using cannabinoid creams. \u201cProducts are safe using cannabinoid extracts,\u201d he says. \u201cMany topical products are already approved and in use.\u201d\nZeichner adds that you can use topical products with cannabinoids just as you would use a product with any other botanical oil, such as sunflower seed oil. \u201cThese products are safe to use, but like any other product, if you develop a rash from it, discontinue it right away,\u201d he says.\n Beauty + Style:\nHere\u2019s Why You Might Want to Slather Marijuana on Your Body Bearded Woman Who Suffers from PCOS Embraces Her Beauty Instagrammer Posts Makeup-Free Selfie, Inspiring Others to Do Same ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml", "http://www.goldenbergdermatology.com/", "https://www.pinterest.com/yahoostyle/&quot;", "https://twitter.com/yahoostyle", "https://twitter.com/yahoobeauty", "https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-04/uoca-cms041717.php", "https://www.pinterest.com/yahoostyle/", "https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/ds.shtml&quot;", "http://www.zeichnerdermatology.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/yahoostylebeauty&quot;", "https://www.facebook.com/yahoostylebeauty", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TkGb0nwvkvcOdYrPn.0oBw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9NTU4/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/16e2c0041b072800207115ae190934cf", "https://www.instagram.com/yahoostylebeauty/&quot;", "https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-04/uoca-cms041717.php&quot;", "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962217303080", "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0190962217303080&quot;", "https://www.instagram.com/yahoostylebeauty/", "https://twitter.com/yahoostyle&quot;", "https://twitter.com/yahoobeauty&quot;", "http://www.goldenbergdermatology.com/&quot;", "http://www.zeichnerdermatology.com/&quot;"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-19T03:22:57.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "36e2054427477eaf5ac36e386b89d35de04e2f0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOi9Xt.Q.MAcZHJu0GxkzgryZk6OzF7dey_n_ijacTMxUTYX1lsikP2aY8x60aofE4mjkW.lQHbS.m3y9euUXHwn", "site_full": "www.huffingtonpost.com", "site": "huffingtonpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/feeds/verticals/politics/index.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Politics -

By Matt Fuller , Jonathan Cohn 320 \nWASHINGTON \u2015 GOP moderates and conservatives are nearing a deal on health care that in theory could get the Republican alternative to the Affordable Care Act out of the House and over to the Senate. The changes also might move Republicans even further away from passage \u2015 no one really knows. \nThe deal, brokered between House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Tuesday Group co-chairman Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), would allow states to get waivers eliminating the so-called community rating provision \u2015 the rule that prohibits insurers from charging higher premiums to people with pre-existing conditions. In order to obtain the waiver, states would have to participate in a federal high-risk pool or establish their own, and satisfy some other conditions. \nIn exchange for that conservative concession, the amendment would reinstate the Essential Health Benefits that were already taken out of the bill \u2015 though, again, states could waive those provisions as well if they were able to show that doing so would lower premiums, increase the number of people insured, or \u201cadvance another benefit to the public interest in the state.\u201d \nThat\u2019s according to a white paper describing the amendment, which is the result of weeks of negotiation between Meadows and MacArthur. While they have both agreed to the amendment, supposedly representing a number of conservatives and moderates respectively, the amendment is still being reviewed by the Senate and House GOP leadership. NICHOLAS KAMM via Getty Images \nAdditionally, with Republicans effectively going back on their repeated promises to guarantee coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, the amendment could lose a number of Republicans who already supported the legislation. In short, even though the Tuesday Group and the Freedom Caucus think they have a deal, Republicans writ large might have nothing. \nLeadership is expected to discuss the amendment on a conference call this Saturday with GOP members, but public opinion might also affect the landscape. Republicans are trying to say their amendment will cover people with pre-existing conditions \u2015 because, first, the legislation still claims those people can\u2019t be denied coverage, and second, because there will be high-risk pools for those people if insurance costs dramatically go up for them. \nThe reality, however, is that insurers would be able to effectively deny coverage by pricing sick people out of the market. \n\u201cThis effectively allows states to eliminate the ACA\u2019s guarantee of access to insurance at a reasonable price for people with pre-existing conditions, in the interest of lowering premiums for people who are healthy,\u201d Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, said upon seeing a description of the proposal. \u201cIt seems to tilt heavily towards what the Freedom Caucus has been looking for.\u201d \nRepublicans argue that the high-risk pools would then cover those people, taking them out of the regular insurance pool and lowering prices for everyone else, but high-risk pools have traditionally been underfunded by states and the federal government, resulting in poor coverage and high costs for those who need insurance the most. \nThose concerns may be significant enough that, even with MacArthur\u2019s blessing, the deal does not win over moderates. The concessions also might not be enough for some conservatives, who have expressed issue with Republicans establishing an advance refundable tax credit to help pay for insurance. \nRepublicans need 216 votes to pass their health care bill, and based on statements from GOP members, even with the support of the entire Freedom Caucus for the amendment, there may be enough moderate hold-outs to prevent passage anyway. (MacArthur doesn\u2019t count as a convert; he supported the last bill, albeit reluctantly.) \nThe amendment wouldn\u2019t seem to address the big concerns moderates have expressed \u2015 like raising the cap on how much insurers can charge seniors or cutting $880 billion from Medicaid. These changes are among the reasons that the Congressional Budget Office predicted the House health care legislation would increase the number of people without insurance by 24 million within a decade. \nMany Republicans \u2015 particularly in the Senate \u2015 have said such deep cuts are not acceptable. Just this week, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said he couldn\u2019t support a proposal that jeopardized coverage for the approximately 300,000 people in his state dependent on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion. \nPublic opinion has also shifted since the repeal effort began in earnest \u2015 and it has shifted decisively against Republicans and their cause. The Affordable Care Act is more popular than ever, and in a recent Pew Research Center poll, 54 percent of Americans said they trusted Democrats more than Republicans on health care, while just 35 percent said they trusted Republicans more. That\u2019s the biggest advantage for Democrats on health care since 2009. \nIn short, some leaders in the GOP conference might think they have a deal, but they also might have just found a way to make the bill even more unpalatable for Republicans, thus bringing Congress no closer at all. \nStill, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) suggested that Republicans were getting close to a deal. \u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of negotiating sort of finishing touches,\u201d Ryan said Wednesday during a trip to London. \nSign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

The actress will reprise her role as Blind Al in Deadpool 2 , The Hollywood Reporter \u2018s Heat Vision blog has confirmed. The news was first reported by Blackfilm.com , which spoke to the actress about returning opposite Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool\u2019s roommate. Uggams lent an unexpected level of prestige to last year\u2019s Deadpool and her Blind Al became an instant favorite, with her and Reynolds establishing strong chemistry that lent itself to some very funny bickering. Deadpool 2 recently cast Josh Brolin as Cable , and also will feature Atlanta \u2018s Zazie Beetz as Domino . No release date has been set, but it\u2019s expected for 2018. David Leitch is directing . Uggams is a Tony winner, Daytime Emmy winner, and has been nominated for a Golden Globe and a Primetime Emmy.

Jackson recorded a radio ad for Ossoff while actress Alyssa Milano helped drive voters to the polls. Hollywood producers were among the 95 percent of Ossoff donors from outside Georgia. \nOssoff made a similar case against Handel, warning that conservative \"dark money\" groups would drown the district in phony attack ads. \nDespite raising a record-breaking $8.3 million in the first three months of the year, Ossoff was still outspent by Republicans almost two-to-one on advertising , according to the analytics firm Echelon Insights. \nThree outside conservatives groups alone spent a cumulative $5 million on ads attacking the Democrat. \n\"There's no doubt that mega-donors eager to protect the rigged system in Washington will pour millions in corporate special interest money into this race,\" said Tiffany Muller, the executive director of End Citizens United, which raised more than $800,000 for Ossoff. \nBut Ossoff's out-of-state donations have become a major vulnerability for a candidate who doesn't actually live in the district (he lives a few miles away and plans to move back if he wins). \nRepublicans are painting him as too liberal, too young, and too out-of-touch with Georgia to represent a district once held by Newt Gingrich. \n\"I think he got 8 million dollars and like 12 bucks from Georgia,\" South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham joked on Fox News Business. \"I mean it was an unbelievable amount of money. So all the mad liberals have been sending him money.\" \nHandel raised far less money than Ossoff, but 90 percent of people who contributed more than $200 to her campaign were from the Georgia, according to Atlanta Journal Constitution. \n\"The best chance a Hollywood-backed liberal Democrat had of winning a Georgia House race just came and went. No amount of momentum, media hype or money could push Jon Ossoff over the finish line, and he now begins a two-month slog toward political irrelevance,\" said Colin Reed of the conservative super PAC America Rising. \nOssoff defended himself by noting he raised more money from Georgia than any other candidate in the race. That sum was just swamped by his unprecedented national fundraising. \n\"I grew up in this district, I grew up in this community, and I'm proud to say that more Georgians have made contributions to my campaign than to any other candidate in the race this campaign,\" he said on MSNBC. \nAnd Ossoff can count on plenty of help from around the country. \nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez, who is heading to Georgia Thursday, said the DNC is \"all in.\" \n\"I'd rather be Jon Ossoff right now than Karen Handel,\" he said on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe.\"\"I'm actually very optimistic. You see this energy everywhere across America. I mean, I've been traveling across the country this week and the energy is palpable. And we're going to translate that energy into more votes.\" \nAnd one of the top Democrats in the state, Georgia House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, batted away the \"Georgia values\" talk by noting the 6th Congressional District has become younger and more diverse since Gingrich represented it. \n\"The Georgia electorate is changing,\" she said in a statement. \"Tonight's results prove Jon Ossoff is running an extraordinary campaign that is in line with our values as Georgians, energizing a diverse coalition of voters in the 6th district, and illuminating Democratic opportunities like never before.\" Alex Seitz-Wald ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jon ossoff", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gingrich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lindsey graham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karen handel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samuel l. jackson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alex seitz-wald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "handel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom perez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ossoff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tiffany muller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alyssa milano", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stacey abrams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newt gingrich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colin reed", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nbc news democrat", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "pac america rising", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dnc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "end citizens united", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "msnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic national committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta journal constitution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "echelon insights", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox news business", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia house", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south carolina", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-19T23:47:39.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e3de6daed97c421766786a3e1d45c833a47726df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOh52wiEpf0BClHOfYoo.kRkM.kMRonpORDLVsq8eUrPVPAUQ3WovY6tyTrJ6pc5iuBnCzVbfT8lc4RAbgyMvfcs", "site_full": "www.huffingtonpost.com", "site": "huffingtonpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com//feeds/index.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The Huffington Post | The Full Feed", "title": "'Hidden Figures' Curriculum Brings Film's Lessons To The Classroom", "title_full": "'Hidden Figures' Curriculum Brings Film's Lessons To The Classroom", "published": "2017-04-19T23:55:36.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/58f7c2e31b0000330016c6a0.jpeg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 139, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 989, "comments": 3, "shares": 989}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e3de6daed97c421766786a3e1d45c833a47726df", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOh52wiEpf0BClHOfYoo.kRkM.kMRonpORDLVsq8eUrPVPAUQ3WovY6tyTrJ6pc5iuBnCzVbfT8lc4RAbgyMvfcs", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Taryn Finley", "published": "2017-04-19T23:55:36.000+03:00", "title": "'Hidden Figures' Curriculum Brings Film's Lessons To The Classroom", "text": "'Hidden Figures' Curriculum Brings Film's Lessons To The Classroom Teachers can get this guide for free. The guide includes eight comprehensive lesson plans for high school students. 2k \nLessons from the hit film \u201cHidden Figures\u201d are coming to the classroom. \nTwentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment announced Monday that it\u2019s partnering with nonprofit Journeys in Film and the USC Rossier School of Education to offer a curriculum guide with lesson plans based on the film. \n\u201cHidden Figures\u201d is based on the true \u2015 yet previously little-known \u2015 story of three of the first black \u201chuman computers\u201d (Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson) at NASA, who helped send the first American into orbit. The film, starring Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer and Janelle Mon\u00e1e, earned more money in the country than any other movie nominated for Best Picture at the time of the 2017 Academy Awards. \n\u201c\u2019 Hidden Figures \u2019 is ideally suited for use in the classroom, but teachers want students to do more with a film than passively view it,\u201d the press release reads. \u201cJourneys in Film has prepared eight comprehensive, standards-aligned lesson plans for secondary students. These interdisciplinary lessons can be used independently or through a team approach that gives students multiple lenses through which to consider the relevant historical and contemporary issues raised by the film.\u201d \nThe first few lessons explore the context surrounding the events in the film, including the Cold War, the pressure women faced at the center in Langley, Virginia, the vital role \u201chuman computers\u201d played, segregation and the dawning of the civil rights movement. The curriculum also includes math and science lessons exploring scientific notation, conic sections, orbits and programming. There are additional lessons for students to analyze the film\u2019s theme and style. \nSince the film premiered nationwide in January, more girls appear to be inspired to pursue careers in STEM \u2015 an industry in which women, especially women of color, are still underrepresented \u2015 according to Aldis Hodge, who has a role in the film. \nTeachers are able to download the curriculum for free from Journeys in Film\u2019s website. Fox is also giving complimentary copies of \u201cHidden Figures\u201d on DVD to eligible high schools.

Fewer children are learning to ski in a region thought to be the birthplace of skiing. Credit Garrett Grove China\u2019s Stone Age Skiers and History\u2019s Harsh Lessons Cave paintings in the Altai Mountains may show the cradle of skiing is in China. But the ethnic minorities who live there worry the old ways are in danger. By KADE KRICHKO Continue reading the main story Tucked beneath a shallow outcropping in the rolling lowlands of the Altai Mountains, four men glide along the shadow-pocked rock face, their faint silhouettes stalking a herd of unsuspecting ibex. To their left, a fifth swoops downhill, corralling the beasts with a spear in his hand. His pigmented frame arcs from left, to right, and back again \u2014 a ski turn that may be the oldest ever recorded. The hunters are part of a cave painting in the northern tip of China\u2019s Xinjiang region, a wedge of territory that pokes up between Mongolia to the east and Kazakhstan to the west. According to Chinese archaeologists, the painting dates back more than 10,000 years \u2014 2,000 more than the next earliest ski artifact on record. Now, as the popularity of winter sports explodes in China, driven by President Xi Jinping \u2019s decree that his country would have 300 million winter sports enthusiasts by the time it hosts the 2022 Winter Olympics, ski tour companies have begun opening their doors in this remote region. The first heli-skiing and snowmobile-access tours started operating this winter in the nearby village of Khom, offering trips deep into the heart of the Altai. Continue reading the main story And while international scholars and historians are slowly coming around to the idea that sliding on snow may have indeed originated here instead of the Scandinavian mountains that were long considered its cradle, a deeper battle over skiing\u2019s origins is already being waged within China\u2019s own borders. It is a struggle marked by fears that ethnic minorities like the Mongols and Kazakhs who have long lived in the these mountains will have their way of life choked off by encroaching modernity \u2014 and the country\u2019s ethnic Han Chinese majority, which dominates a government that has had no qualms shaping Chinese culture in its own image. The ethnic Han \u201cnever used these boards, yet they are claiming an attachment to it,\u201d said a traditional skier who flies the flag of Kazakhstan over his family\u2019s log home in Khom, the village that shares its name with the river that runs through this valley. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s a national pride thing, but in reality it\u2019s our ancestors that were doing it.\u201d Like many in this village in northern Xinjiang, China\u2019s largest region of this area, the skier, 27, was hesitant to speak openly about the collision of cultures in his backyard, fearing his words could bring retribution. He grew up on skis, venturing into the mountains behind his home on tall, hand-hewn wooden planks just as his Kazakh ancestors \u2014 products of the many nomadic waves that swept Central Asia over thousands of years \u2014 did before him. His Mongolian neighbors often do the same, and a handful of Tuwas, a small mountain culture of Mongolian descent, are considered the best skiers in the valley.

Credit Garrett Grove The skier considers the Han Chinese to be foreigners who pull governmental strings thousands of miles to the east in a capital he will never visit. He had barely seen an ethnic Han skier when Shan Zhaojian, a Han ski historian who was led to the cave paintings by Altai herders, announced to the world at a news conference in Beijing in 2006 that China was the \u201coriginal place for human skiing.\u201d \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Newfound History Shan, 79, had long sought the true origin story for skiing. He has dedicated more than 60 years to the sport \u2014 he won China\u2019s first Nordic national championship \u2014 and consulted for China\u2019s 2022 Winter Olympic Committee. But it is his obsession with skiing\u2019s roots that has become his life\u2019s work. The International Ski Federation, the sport\u2019s major governing body, has declared a ski found in a Northern Russia bog as the oldest scientifically dated evidence of skiing in the world. And Norwegian cave paintings depicting skiers dating to 4,000 B.C. are considered by experts as evidence of an early ski culture with Scandinavian roots. Continue reading the main story Photo Skiers from the Yunding Ski School pass a construction site for a large hotel being built for the 2022 Winter Olympics outside Beijing. Credit Garrett Grove The cave paintings Shan came upon in 1993 are believed to be far older, although they have not been carbon-dated, leading to some skepticism among ski historians that the paintings are truly as old as the Chinese researchers say they are. Two years ago, he organized a conference of leading historians from Scandinavia, North America, and local Central Asian communities to share the histories of skiing from different parts of the world. There is no consensus that any of the ethnic groups of the Altai can stake a claim as the rightful heirs of the painted skiers \u2014 thousands of years of conquest, including when the region came under the rule of the Qing dynasty in the mid-1700s, have left such a determination all but impossible \u2014 but the locals here have bristled under the idea that skiing could be claimed as the history of the country to which they owe their citizenship rather than the ethnic bloodlines to which they owe their heritage. \u201cEducation is the way to ease tension,\u201d Shan said. \u201cTen thousand years ago was still the Stone Ages, there was no minority diversity, no country borders. As a researcher, being tolerant of opinions different from one\u2019s own is the most important thing.\u201d So far, Shan and his team of ski historians have done this work without much public fanfare. He believes recognition for Altai skiing\u2019s history will grow as the 2022 Games approach, and he hopes that will lead to funding for a ski history museum and a ski history foundation. Those efforts, and the arrival of new businesses looking to capitalize on the region\u2019s history and bring modern skiers to the mountains of the Altai, would be an economic boon to one of the poorest sections of China. But the looming possibility of cultural appropriation has the traditional skiers nervous. In the past, such recognition has come as a double-edged sword \u2014 one that has carved up local communities trying to preserve their cultural identity.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-19T13:07:16.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8118c11b92b749e91af8aa0ca6c18125dc729501", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOj4FB.WVkAkabjaDDnBFGS34vBbp7VlytK6zIJkqGoTnqp.E2Bk_f0SkTgNQDkeoDQsjbLwXsVvJKwG08VrU5KZhzjyQ_7ytoBtJxBi9_JI1RhL9rc4X1Qz.eRoa375hT.bNGpM05GVnsnkG8CGmTtp", "site_full": "www.huffingtonpost.com", "site": "huffingtonpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com//feeds/index.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The Huffington Post | The Full Feed", "title": "Gabrielle Union's New Book Has The Perfect Title: 'We're Going To Need More Wine'", "title_full": "Gabrielle Union's New Book Has The Perfect Title: 'We're Going To Need More Wine'", "published": "2017-04-19T19:06:07.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/58f7869714000021001b519f.jpeg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 139, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 985, "comments": 1, "shares": 985}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "8118c11b92b749e91af8aa0ca6c18125dc729501", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOj4FB.WVkAkabjaDDnBFGS34vBbp7VlytK6zIJkqGoTnqp.E2Bk_f0SkTgNQDkeoDQsjbLwXsVvJKwG08VrU5KZhzjyQ_7ytoBtJxBi9_JI1RhL9rc4X1Qz.eRoa375hT.bNGpM05GVnsnkG8CGmTtp", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Zeba Blay", "published": "2017-04-19T19:06:07.000+03:00", "title": "Gabrielle Union's New Book Has The Perfect Title: 'We're Going To Need More Wine'", "text": "Gabrielle Union's New Book Has The Perfect Title: 'We're Going To Need More Wine' Union's book will feature stories about sex, politics, and beauty.

Informal egg roll parties were recorded at the White House during the early Lincoln administration.\nDuring the post-Civil War years, the Easter egg games were played on the grounds surrounding the U.S. Capitol Building. In 1876, an act of Congress outlawed the Capitol grounds and terraces from being used as playgrounds to protect the property from destruction. In 1878, President Rutherford B. Hayes officially opened the White House grounds to local children for egg rolling on Easter Monday.\nDuring World War I and II, the events were canceled. Dwight D. Eisenhower and First Lady Mamie Eisenhower revived the event in 1953 after a 12-year absence. In 1969, Pat Nixon's staff introduced the White House Easter Bunny, a staffer dressed in a white fleece bunny costume who roamed the grounds and welcomed the egg rollers and posed for photographs. By 1974 the activities evolved into organized egg-rolling races. The 1981 eggstravaganza included assorted clowns and characters, balloon vendors, Broadway show vignettes, a petting zoo, exhibits of antique cars, and an eggxposition of specially decorated eggs (one for each state). Each egg roller received a goody bag filled with a program, toy products supplied by corporate sponsors, and food- whose wrappers littered the lawn. Since 1987 the event's theme has been inscripted on each egg, and by 1989 George and Barbara Bush added their facsimile signatures. Today the official eggs are given one to a child (under 12) as they leave the South Lawn.\nRead More About Easter in Washington, DC\nRelated Articles Washington, DC's 2017 Major Annual Events

pm ET After His Wife's Death, Man Still Uses The Last Coffee Can She Bought \"When he runs out, he puts his new coffee into the old can and never changes spoons.\" By Brittany Wong 1.6k \nWhen his wife of 41 years died of skin cancer in 2012, David Hoskins packed up and moved in with his daughter to nearby Hazard, Kentucky. \nHoskins didn\u2019t take much with him, but he kept two things: the last can of coffee his wife Karen bought befo re she got sick and the spoon she used to stir her coffee every morning. \nFive years later, the 66-year-old widow still uses both every day. \n\u201cLooking at that picture of him with his coffee can, you\u2019d never know that that\u2019s all he has left of her,\u201d his daughter Kim Hoskins Fields wrote in a now-viral Facebook post shared on the page Love What Matters on Saturday. \u201cBecause that\u2019s how they always started their day was with coffee, and so each day he starts his day with my mama.\u201d \nIn an interview with The Huffington Post, Hoskins Fields said the spoon and the Maxwell House coffee canister \u2015 which her dad refills when it starts to get low \u2015 are sacred items in her home. \n\u201cWhen he moved in his things, he told me to never throw the can away and to never touch the spoon inside of it,\u201d she said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want it mixed up with my other spoons.\u201d \n\u201cI kind of laughed and asked him why,\u201d Hoskins Fields said. \u201cHe explained that it was all he kept because it made him feel close to her, like she was still there each morning.\u201d \nThe couple had six kids during their marriage (two from Hoskin\u2019s previous marriage), so couple-time was often in short supply. Every morning, though, they made time for coffee. \n\u201cEven when I was little and she went to work super early he would get up with her and have a cup,\u201d their daughter said. Kim Hoskins Fields Kim and David Hoskin with one of their granddaughters. \nKaren\u2019s diagnosis of melanoma in October 2012 came out of nowhere and he grappled with the news, according to his daughter. Two months later, Karen died. \n\u201cWhen she was dying, he made himself sick with worry and tried to save her,\u201d Hoskins Fields said. \u201cHe begged and pleaded with God. He would have traded anything, gave anything or done anything to save her.\u201d \nThese days, coffee is all Hoskins needs to remember his late wife. \n\u201cHe says he has all the pictures and memories he wants in his mind,\u201d she said. \u201cHe kept what he knew would make him feel the closest to her.\u201d Related Stories", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kim hoskins fields kim", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david hoskins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hoskin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim hoskins fields", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brittany wong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hoskins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david hoskin", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "maxwell house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huffington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hoskins fields", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kentucky", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-18T23:57:06.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "fcb4a64856287cc376b360070fdfa358abf160a0", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR12YKHzHc9uTcNpIrEc8ejpP6vUktj2u1h20Hf1Vz0a.l6I6o6D5CdDM5nQ8nHltqr1NyoMxrzs8GxbFfTgKv2JzWZA_o_UXaD4dn067yUj_eLLn8VM0SaGqzcf0kACK8VAnRdeNKgwm0AkFcSJfFPLYlJpAJjMEIT_J56StOAQMzWqFLhhs19Q_FNAAqU273rmwFq7fKTgsDho1RpPa9pH65CoS_VFfxw.5iw8OFPhvP6uShoDIyQZB2xBloXzqv9XcOKLoJXM8HRWqcfnspv", "site_full": "www.theatlantic.com", "site": "theatlantic.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/AtlanticInternational", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Global | The Atlantic", "title": "Could Trump's Financial Ties Have Influenced His Phone Call With Erdogan? - The Atlantic", "title_full": "Could Trump's Financial Ties Have Influenced His Phone Call With Erdogan? - The Atlantic", "published": "2017-04-19T00:55:49.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2017/04/RTR30Z9T/facebook.jpg?1492550381", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 918, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 982, "comments": 0, "shares": 982}, "gplus": {"shares": 8}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 85}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "6238c5fda7e681dc0bb7b71f9270dd400cc38178", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZR12YKHzHc9uTcNpIrEc8ejpP6vUktj2u1h20Hf1Vz0a.l6I6o6D5CdDM5nQ8nHltqr1NyoMxrzs8GxbFfTgKv2JzWZA_o_UXaD4dn067yUj1sA4jG97Jr7", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "The Editors", "published": "2017-04-19T00:55:49.000+03:00", "title": "Could Trump's Financial Ties Have Influenced His Phone Call With Erdogan? - The Atlantic", "text": "On Monday night, President Donald Trump took a moment to praise an autocratic ruler\u2014this time, not Russian President Vladimir Putin but Turkish President Recep Erdogan. In the aftermath of Turkey\u2019s constitutional referendum , which significantly broadened the powers of the country\u2019s president, Trump called his Turkish counterpart \u201cto congratulate him on his recent referendum victory,\u201d as well as to discuss military strategy in the Middle East. Critics soon seized on the call, not only because Trump appeared to be condoning an illiberal power grab that furthers Turkey\u2019s transition from democracy into an authoritarian regime but also because it demonstrates how Trump\u2019s business interests stand to impact his performance as president.\nTrump and his team have for the most part denied that the president\u2019s properties and other businesses around the world create conflicts of interest. But that\u2019s not the case for Trump Towers in Istanbul. In a 2015 interview with Steve Bannon, at the time the executive chair of Breitbart News , then-candidate Trump acknowledged , \u201cI have a little conflict of interest because I have a major, major building in Istanbul.\u201d That didn\u2019t stop him from bringing up the properties, albeit obliquely, when he spoke with Erdogan shortly after winning the presidency in November: In that phone call, Trump relayed praise for Erdogan from one of Trump\u2019s business partners in the region.

His performance as \"Tuck Bedford\"the fictional host of \"Brain Fight\"killed on two levels. First, it was a timely and obvious dig at Alex Jones, whose lawyer had just claimed the Infowars host was actually a performance artist. Then there was the obvious nod to the fact that Colbert himself became famous by portraying a right-wing pundit who at one point blurred the lines between fiction and reality.\nIt's sometimes difficult to remember that when The Colbert Report first came out, its host was so convincing, and the concept was so novel, that some interviewees didn't know what they were signing up for. While Sasha Baren Cohen benefitted from ambushing unsuspecting subjects as Ali G, his successor Colbert was able to famously own some early guests who didn't think that he would ask serious questions.\nLast year, author Lee Siegel claimed in the Columbia Journalism Review that Colbert's brand of punditry paved the way for the fake news of today . But Colbert's winks were always obvious, and his core audience always understood his meaning. The most successful conspiracy-mongers working in America today have a different strategy entirelythey say whatever they want, and if they're called on it, they can always claim they were joking. Call it the \"Colbert Defense.\" It's the ultimate get-out-of-jail-free cardand a way for people who cross the line to never have to take responsibility for their actions.\nA particularly blatant example of this came this week during Alex Jones's custody battle with his ex-wife, who claimed Jones was an unfit father because of the insane things he said on his popular radio program, Infowars. In response, Jones's lawyer said the host was just \" playing a character ,\" albeit a character who shared the real Alex Jones's name, occupation, and general outlook on life.\nJones is far from the first rabble-rouser to fall back on the Colbert Defense. We first got a whiff of this back in 2011, when Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain gave a speech in Tennessee calling for an Mexican border fence that was \"20 feet hight with barbed wire\" and \"electrified.\" The crowd cheered loudly as he also suggested it would be able to kill Mexicans. After people got pissed, Cain backtracked on Meet the Press , claiming that his comments were just a joke and that \"America [needed] to get a sense of humor.\"\nCain wouldn't be the last right-winger to complain about being taken too literally. During an extremely ill-considered appearance on Colbert , FOXNews diatribe machine Bill O'Reilly was asked who would win in a fight between him and fellow FOXhost Sean Hannity. \"I'm effete. I'm not a tough guy,\" he said. \"This is all an act.\" Colbert responded with a meta commentary on things to come: \"If you're an act, then what am I?\"\nSince then, political commentary has become increasingly like pro wrestlingexcept no one breaks kayfabe. And though Colbert's audience was largely liberals who wanted to laugh at the right-wing blowhards the comedian was satirizing, O'Reilly and Jones are playing \"characters\" that appeal to people who mostly share their views. \nThis can get very confusing. Rush Limbaugh has been relying on sensationalism and bombast for decades, but almost no one would question whether he believes what he says. In 2008, Glenn Beck moved over from CNN to FOXNews and made a splash for being even more provocative. In constantly railing against progressivism a \"cancer,\" he basically invented the kind of punditry that birthed stars like Milo Yiannopoulos,who wouldlater use the same word repeatedly to describe feminism.\nNotably, Beck went on full-blown apology tour after realizing he helped create Donald Trump. \"I could excuse it, to some degreeI won'tbut I could excuse some of it by saying that I was trying to, in some ways, accomplish what Jon Stewart can accomplish: draw huge crowds, make points and then encourage you to do your own homework,\" he told the New York Times . That fits the pattern of rightwingers distancing themselves from their most hateful rhetoric. After Yiannopoulos got fired from his job at Breitbart for appearing to defend pederasty, he claimed that his schtick was a joke.\n\"The videos do not show what people say they show,\" he said in a Facebook statement. \"I did joke about giving better head as a result of clerical sexual abuse committed against me when I was a teen. If I choose to deal in an edgy way on an internet livestream with a crime I was the victim of that's my prerogative. It's no different to gallows humor from AIDS sufferers.\"\n\nIt's doubtful that many people turn to Yiannopoulos or Jones for satire. Certainly the guy who showed up at a DC pizza restaurant with a gun to \"investigate\" the pizzagateconspiracy that Infowars helped spread didn't think he was watching a comedy program. (Jones later apologized for his coverage of the nonsensical theory.) \nOf course, it's one thing if the average Infowars listener doesn't know if he or she isbeing sold entertainment or news. It's much more terrifying when the president of the United States ( himself a Jones fan ) is playing the same game where it's unclear how seriously or literally we're supposed to take him. During a campaign event in July, Trump suggested that Russian hackers should go looking for Hillary Clinton's deleted emails, then after an outcry claimed he was being sarcastic .\nMaybe he was. But sarcasm and politics don't mix well, and not everyone is equipped with the same joke radar. Colbert, for one, knew this. In a 2006 interview on 60 Minutes , he was asked if his kids watched his show. \"Kids can't understand irony or sarcasm,\" he told Morley Safer. Maybe neither can Jones's audience?\nFollow Allie Conti on Twitter .", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name":

way after having gone for Barack Obama previously, there were also districts, like the one in Georgia, where Trump did worse than a generic Republican would be expected to. That\u2019s a big part of why Democrats had such high hopes for Ossoff \u2014 that and the fact that Trump\u2019s surprising election and tumultuous presidency so far have energized progressives and other Democrats in a manner that Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy most certainly didn\u2019t. Are they worked up enough to foil and eventually topple Trump? More to the point, are they organized, disciplined and pragmatic enough to turn the passion of marches and street protests into concrete results at the polls? An outright Ossoff victory in Georgia on Tuesday would have been a resounding yes, but the absence of that isn\u2019t a definitive no. It\u2019s a very loud maybe: a question mark in a situation where many partisans and prognosticators itched for an exclamation point. And many dynamics made this an imperfect referendum on Trump\u2019s performance in office and the mood of the electorate. Prime among them: Ossoff, 30, has real shortcomings as a candidate. Although he isn\u2019t necessarily hurt by being a political novice \u2014 voters often welcome fresh faces \u2014 he can come across as callow. He was skewered in negative ads as a lightweight. And he was embarrassed in the home stretch of his campaign by reminders that he isn\u2019t currently residing in the district that he\u2019s seeking to represent. His poise and stamina will be severely tested over the next two months. So will Democrats\u2019 tenacity. The party\u2019s candidate outperformed expectations in a special Congressional election in Kansas last week, but there, too, Democrats were denied the moment of triumph that they so sorely need after the humiliation of Nov. 8 and the diminution of Democratic power nationwide during the Obama years. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story They remain hungry for it. It eludes them still. That\u2019s the takeaway from Tuesday\u2019s special election, which demonstrated anew that Trump\u2019s considerable weakness doesn\u2019t translate automatically and axiomatically into a Democratic advantage.

To qualify as skilled, immigrants will need to get a job in which they earn at least the median income. To qualify as highly skilled, they will need to earn at least 150 per cent of the median income. Other changes include a new three-year limit for workers with lower skills. \n\nWoodhouse said the changes would control the number and improve the quality of immigrants. \n\nIt is the second time New Zealand has tightened its immigration rules in the past six months and the latest changes come during an election year, when many people have expressed alarm at the immigration rate. \n\nIn the year ending in February, net immigration reached a record 71,300 people, equivalent to 1.5 per cent of New Zealand's total population of 4.8 million people. That's a big swing from five years earlier, when net immigration was negative as more people left the country than arrived. \n\nPart of the turnaround can be attributed to the nation's healthy economy, which is growing at more than 3 percent a year and is attracting back some New Zealanders who had moved abroad. \n\nThe largest numbers of new migrants to New Zealand are coming from China, India and the United Kingdom.

BERTRAND GUAY via Getty Images Life after death. 770 \nWhen it rains Prince , it pours \u2015 purple or otherwise. \nIn honor of the one-year anniversary of the pop star\u2019s death, a posthumous EP titled \u201cDeliverance\u201d with six previously unreleased tracks is set for release on Friday, April 21. \nPrince co-wrote and co-produced the new songs between 2006 and 2008 with longtime producer and collaborator Ian Boxill . Apart from the title track, the EP is comprised of the four-part \u201cMan Opera\u201d (\u201cI Am,\u201d \u201cTouch Me,\u201d \u201cSunrise Sunset\u201d and \u201cNo One Else\u201d), as well as an extended version of \u201cI Am.\u201d \nBoxill has apparently been working on the music over the last year, completing and mixing the EP to honor his late friend. Prince was found dead at his Paisley Park compound in April 2016. Months later, the death was ruled an accidental overdose of the painkiller fentanyl. \n\u201cI believe \u2018Deliverance\u2019 is a timely release with everything going on in the world today, and in light of the one-year anniversary of his passing. I hope when people hear Prince singing these songs it will bring comfort to many,\u201d Boxill said in a statement . \u201cPrince once told me that he would go to bed every night thinking of ways to bypass major labels and get his music directly to the public. When considering how to release this important work, we decided to go independent because that\u2019s what Prince would have wanted.\u201d \nAs the singer was an independent artist when the songs were recorded, the new music will be released under an indie label, Rogue Music Alliance, instead of Universal Music Group , which owns the licensing rights to much of his catalogue. \nBut reports have already begun circulating that a lawsuit has been filed against Boxhill on behalf of Paisley Park and the artist\u2019s estate. Per Variety , the parties claim the producer is \u201ctrying to exploit one or more songs for his personal gain,\u201d stating that the recordings are valued at more than $75,000. They plan to fight for ownership, despite the producer\u2019s claims that he owns the recordings. \nIn the meantime, we can all enjoy it.

He\u2019s referring to that intensely emotional evening on Sept. 1 last year, when the Revolution reunited onstage at First Avenue \u2014 the Minneapolis club where Purple Rain \u2019s concert scenes were filmed \u2014 and celebrated the life and legacy of their former boss.\n\u201cTo walk on that stage and play those songs, knowing that he\u2019s not there,\u201d guitarist Wendy Melvoin says contemplatively, her voice trailing off. On that night, Melvoin \u2014 who handled most of the lead vocals in Prince\u2019s tragic absence \u2014 appeared the most emotional onstage, sometimes struggling to make it through songs like \u201cSometimes It Snows in April.\u201d But she says that by the third and final show of the band\u2019s First Avenue residency, \u201cthe five of us felt a lift. There were more smiles onstage for us. There was more playfulness, and you could feel \u2014 dare I say without sounding too New-Agey? I am not really into this or anything \u2014 but you could actually sense that he looked at us and went, \u2018It\u2019s OK.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cLike kind of a s\u00e9ance,\u201d Bobby adds.\nMelvoin nods. \u201cIt was weird. And we walked offstage and cried.\u201d\nNow, more than six months after that historic evening and a year after Prince\u2019s sudden and shocking death at age 57, Melvoin, Bobby, and the three other core members of the Revolution \u2014 bassist Brownmark and keyboardists Doctor Fink and Lisa Coleman \u2014 are sitting with Yahoo Music at the L.A. rehearsal space where they\u2019re prepping for a nationwide reunion tour . And they\u2019re in good spirits, eager to share their memories of Prince.\n\u201cHe was as you could\u2019ve possibly imagined greatness to be,\u201d says Melvoin, who joined the Revolution in 1983 when she was just 19 years old. (Melvoin\u2019s very first public gig with the band took place at First Avenue, and incredibly, three of the recorded performances from that night made it onto the Purple Rain album. \u201cHe was frantically telling us we\u2019re making history: \u2018We\u2019re making history tonight, this is history tonight,\u2019\u201d recalls Bobby.) \u201cWhen you were in a room with him, he was it . He was ephemeral. He was otherworldly. And he was as talented, or more talented, than what you\u2019d expect. It was jaw-dropping to be around it.\u201d\n\u201cHe was the \u2018funky Yoda\u2019 to me,\u201d says Brownmark. \u201cMy first encounter with him was at his house; Bobby took me out there. To me, the doors were 20 feet high \u2026 because I was scared to death. He opened the door, and I was like, \u2018Oh, my God. This dude is a rock star!\u2019 \u2014 because I never been that close to a real, hardcore rock star. I was blown away. From that moment, my life changed. My whole thought process of what stardom was \u2014 it changed at that point. I really started to get the difference between who I was and who this guy was.\u201d\nBobby, who joined Prince\u2019s musical entourage earlier, in 1979, remembers that even before Prince was an actual rock star, he was a rock star. \u201cFor me, when it started, Prince was very unfamous. We were very unfamous together,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cBut he still had all these magical qualities. He used to practice being a rock star \u2014 like, he couldn\u2019t go into restaurants, or he couldn\u2019t go into a gas station, because he was going to be a rock star and he was going to be famous. He was always projecting himself to be this persona. \u2026 It\u2019s just mind-boggling to think that he conjured up all this confidence and skill. We were all mere mortals. I knew that in the first look of the guy, you could tell he wasn\u2019t a human. He was more of a reptile, or something different in his DNA.\u201d\n\u201cOne thing that a lot of people don\u2019t realize about him is he lived and breathed what he did,\u201d says Brownmark, who joined the band in 1982. \u201cMy first assignment, before I even picked up a guitar, was in Prince\u2019s living room: Look at myself in the mirror eight hours a day. He would tell me how to stand. He said, \u2018No, pivot your foot that way. OK, now turn your cheek to do this. Get your shoulder up. Bend your shoulder back.\u2019 That\u2019s how he trained me. Then it got to a point where I would be out at a club somewhere and I\u2019d be standing, I\u2019d have this pose, and people would come up to me and say, \u2018Mark, what\u2019s wrong with you? Why are you standing like that?\u2019 I didn\u2019t even know I was doing it.\nRead More \u201cHe would condition you like that,\u201d continues Brownmark, revealing that the band members even took ballet lessons with Prince, at his insistence, to hone their stage skills for the Purple Rain film . \u201cThe more you rehearse, the more you don\u2019t think about it, the less you think about it. Then the more fun you have, and that was the key to the Revolution. We didn\u2019t think about it. He would throw up these cues, and we knew every marker, we knew every cue, and we would hit it \u2014 just BAM, BAM! We knew right where to hit.\u201d\nMelvoin elaborates on Prince\u2019s vision when it came to assembling the Revolution: \u201cHe hired these individuals; we came to the picture with singular personalities and self-possessed in our own lives. That translated to each one of our personalities with an instrument. Bobby was always the gentleman and put-together, and that reflected in his absolute pocket, meat-and-potatoes, four-on-the-floor drumming, sturdy. Lisa, the ethereal person who walks on air, whispers when she talks \u2014 her music sounds that way. Matt [Fink], he is like a doctor; he can play his keyboard and get from the left side of the 88 keys all the way to the right side faster than any human being. And [Brownmark] is the sexy, gorgeous, all-encompassing, curious flirt, and that\u2019s how his bass sounds.\u201d\nBobby adds that Prince had a \u201cgrand vision\u201d for the aptly named Revolution inspired by coed bands like Fleetwood Mac, racially mixed acts like Sly & the Family Stone, and the ethnic diversity of Minneapolis\u2019s Uptown neighborhood. \u201cWhite, black, Puerto Rican, everybody just a-freakin\u2019,\u201d he quips, quoting a line from Prince\u2019s Dirty Mind track \u201cUptown.\u201d\nMelvoin and Coleman especially appreciated the band\u2019s sense of inclusivity. \u201cI was very aware that [Prince] loved female musicians,\u201d Melvoin says. \u201cMy being a woman onstage gave him license to be just even that much more androgynous and be more in touch with his own female energy, and I got the permission to be in touch with more of my male energy\u2026 I wanted to be more of a counterpart to him, and he wanted me to be more of a counterpart, so we both got what we wanted out of it.\u201d\nStill, Melvoin and Coleman can\u2019t help but roll their eyes when asked about the famous \u201cIs the water warm enough?\u201d intro from the provocative Purple Rain track \u201c Computer Blue .\u201d What did that mean, exactly?\n\u201c\u2019Are you gay?\u2019 That\u2019s what it meant,\u201d groans Melvoin, who was actually in a serious romantic relationship with Coleman for 20 years. \u201cDo you want to get in the bathtub with me, Lisa? Are we lovers? \u2018Are they gay? Are they not?\u2019 He was working that angle.\u201d\n\u201cThat was another fantasy episode going on in his brain that he got the public sucked into. Sexually suggestive lyrics were part of his early core to the end,\u201d Bobby chuckles.\n\u201cYou have to have a certain amount of f***ability, being a woman first and not a musician,\u201d Melvoin continues, discussing the objectification most women face in the music industry, \u201cand I didn\u2019t have access to that part of myself \u2014 and didn\u2019t want to have access to that part. But I was OK with the way Prince saw [female musicianship]. I didn\u2019t have much of a relationship to what it really meant in the big picture, to him and his world, but I was honored to be in this band. For me, it was more like: \u2018Oh, my God, I\u2019m part of the Revolution!\u2019 Sure, we\u2019re the chicks in the band, but he\u2019s a Jew, he\u2019s a Jew, and that\u2019s a black guy!\u201d\nFor a while, the multicultural Revolution played in harmony, hitting their commercial and critical peak with 1984\u2019s landmark Purple Rain film and soundtrack. But Prince was already moving on to his next projects, 1985\u2019s more psychedelic (and less successful) Around the World in a Day, and the Under the Cherry Moon movie and its accompanying soundtrack, titled Parade , in 1986.\n\u201cYou know, before we even hit the first show of the Purple Rain tour, he was already bored with Purple Rain ,\u201d laughs Bobby. \u201cHe really thought that people would be done with Purple Rain \u2014 but as we know now, they\u2019re not done with Purple Rain . He was just moving so fast. It was like next, next, next. But Purple Rain is something that people want to examine for centuries now. I look back at everything, but he didn\u2019t \u2014 he wasn\u2019t very good at looking back.\n\u201cThe thing about Prince is the hairstyle would change the whole thing,\u201d Bobby adds with a laugh, \u201cand he was already moving into the hairstyle for \u2018Raspberry Beret.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cHe hated his hair on Around the World in a Day !\u201d says Melvoin. \u201cHe said to me at the video [for \u2018Raspberry Beret\u2019], \u2018I hate my hair; I look like Lou Ferrigno.\u2019 I was like, \u2018The Hulk? He said, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ve got the Hulk\u2019s hair.\u2019\u201d\nMore seriously, Melvoin says, \u201cObviously, Purple Rain was the pinnacle of his, like, \u2018I\u2019m a pop star and these are masterpiece pop songs.\u2019 Afterward, the roots [no pun intended] started going in all these different areas, and he was trying to cherry-pick all these different elements of himself to explore.\u201d\nAnd that was the beginning of the end for the Revolution. As the band worked on the double album Sign \u2018O\u2019 the Times , which was eventually credited as a solo Prince album when it came out in 1987, Bobby recalls that Prince \u201cwas starting to become, finally, after being a superstar all those years, kind of like, \u2018You know, I kind of want to do this myself again.\u2019 I was kind of getting the sense that we had become such a huge part of his everyday life that he may have \u2026 well, we don\u2019t know that he was growing a little tired of it, but we\u2019re a handful. I mean, we weren\u2019t just sidemen. We were the Revolution , and we opened our mouths often.\u201d\n\u201cI knew something shifted our last night at [Japan\u2019s] Yokohama Stadium,\u201d says Melvoin, referring to the Revolution\u2019s final concert on Sept. 9, 1986. \u201cWe were onstage, and he started calling a whole bunch of different people onstage with us while we were playing \u2014 and he hadn\u2019t done that before. And we knew him, and I knew him so well. He wasn\u2019t looking at us. I could feel it. And then we played \u2018Purple Rain,\u2019 and he destroyed the guitar. He destroyed it. And I looked at Bobby, and I went, \u2018It\u2019s over.\u2019 I looked at Lisa. \u2018It\u2019s over!\u2019 And it was over.\u201d\nLater, back in the States, Prince invited Melvoin and Coleman over to his L.A. rental house for dinner \u2014 what Coleman jokingly calls a meal of \u201cpaper-wrapped chicken,\u201d because the women received their pink slips. \u201cI knew it was coming; I just knew it. I was bereft ,\u201d says Melvoin. \u201cI was like, \u2018 What? Now? Why? \u2019 But you know, you can\u2019t swim upstream when someone\u2019s done. When someone\u2019s done, they\u2019re done. And you just have to go, \u2018OK.\u2019\u201d\n\u201cHe just had a vision of a different group in his head,\u201d Bobby shrugs.\nThe full, classic Revolution lineup never ended up playing with Prince again, but Melvoin says that after their breakup, there were \u201cyears of [Prince] sending smoke signals for us to get back there.\u201d (Fink continued to work with Prince through 1990\u2019s Graffiti Bridge ; Brownmark says he was invited to join Prince\u2019s post-Revolution band, the New Power Generation, but declined; and Melvoin and Coleman did perform with Prince at the Brit Awards in 2006 .) A proper Revolution reunion will obviously never happen now, but as the surviving members prepare to hit the road, they believe Prince would approve.\n\u201cHe wants us to play,\u201d Brownmark insists. \u201cHe liked to party, loved to enjoy his music with people. That\u2019s what he wants us to do. Just because he\u2019s gone, he doesn\u2019t want us to go \u2018boo-hoo\u2019 and then go away. He wants us to share while we\u2019re here and enjoy what was.\u201d\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to feel a loss. You will feel a loss,\u201d Melvoin says of what to expect from this year\u2019s Revolution reunion tour. \u201c We feel it. But we\u2019re being respectful about how we\u2019re doing this, in a way that none of us are [trying to be Prince] at all.\u201d\nStill, even without their leader, the Revolution members are aware that the chemistry and history they share is special. \u201c[Prince] called us Mount Rushmore,\u201d says Bobby. \u201cHe knew that this was something unique. And when you go through this together, the movie, the tours\u2026\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re astronauts. We, like, went to the moon,\u201d Melvoin interjects.\n\u201cYeah, we did,\u201d says Bobby. \u201cWe left our footprints on the moon.\u201d\nFollow Lyndsey on Facebook , Twitter , Instagram , Google+ , Amazon , Tumblr , Spotify", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://instagram.com/lyndseyparker&quot;", "http://facebook.com/lyndsanity", "http://open.spotify.com/user/lyndseyparker&quot;", "http://lyndseyparker.tumblr.com/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNQLD7mgZzo", "http://twitter.com/lyndseyparker&quot;", "http://lyndseyparker.tumblr.com/&quot;", "https://plus.google.com/+LyndseyParker/", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Gk67ZYCQvMuhAMzCQJs2YA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODQ7aD04NDtpbD1wbGFuZQ--/https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2016-10-18/75379c30-94e1-11e6-8c8d-c3e317c05743_US-Music-copy.jpg", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B008A8NXGM", "http://open.spotify.com/user/lyndseyparker", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KJA4PVZvQk", "http://twitter.com/lyndseyparker", "http://instagram.com/lyndseyparker", "http://facebook.com/lyndsanity&quot;", "https://plus.google.com/+LyndseyParker/&quot;"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "lyndsey pa", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "fink", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lou ferrigno", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lisa coleman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spotify", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lisa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bobby z.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melvoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt [fink", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prince", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brownmark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wendy melvoin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lyndsey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coleman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bobby", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new power generation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fleetwood mac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uptown", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yokohama stadium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "minneapolis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "first avenue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tumblr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "graffiti bridge", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mount rushmore", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prince\u2019s dirty mind", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "l.a.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amazon", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-21T00:38:28.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "68380f76f40bf658ee05b202c71d75928083325a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxTqL_zg0lpoQSkmIQR6dvqk2JZhqS9B0CCMeeDKAGXatW3r4c3n_NYbTNxBxU1GGQ", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "site": "nytimes.com", "site_section": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/rossdouthat/index.html?rss=1", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Ross Douthat", "title": "A Requiem for \u2018Girls\u2019", "title_full": "A Requiem for \u2018Girls\u2019", "published": "2017-04-19T11:34:03.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/19/opinion/19douthatWeb/19douthatWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 98, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 981, "comments": 0, "shares": 981}, "gplus": {"shares": 3}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 9}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "68380f76f40bf658ee05b202c71d75928083325a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxTqL_zg0lpoQSkmIQR6dvqk2JZhqS9B0CCMeeDKAGXatW3r4c3n_NYbTNxBxU1GGQ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ROSS DOUTHAT", "published": "2017-04-19T11:34:03.000+03:00", "title": "A Requiem for \u2018Girls\u2019", "text": "Privacy Policy But \u201cGirls\u201d was a show in which any kind of confident male authority or presence was simply gone , among most of the older characters as well as among the millennial protagonists. The show\u2019s four girls had mostly absent fathers (the only involved and caring one came out as gay midway through the show) and few Don Draper-esque bosses to contend with. The toxic bachelors they dated were more pathetic than threatening, and the \u201csensitive\u201d guys still more so; even the most intense relationships they formed were semi-pathological. A few men on the show (the oldest of the younger characters, most notably) exhibited moral decency and some sort of idealism, a few were genuinely sinister \u2014 but mostly the male sex seemed adrift, permanently boyish, a bundle of hormonal impulses leagues away from any kind of serious and potent manhood. Meanwhile the girls themselves were all, to varying degrees, antiheroic : as self-destructive and narcissistic in their way as the embattled patriarchs familiar from other HBO productions. (Though, yes, rather less murderous.) From the beginning, the unattractiveness of their behavior inspired some queasy responses to the show from liberal and feminist critics, and some celebratory rejoinders about how the freedom to make a mess \u2014 sexually and otherwise \u2014 is the central freedom that feminism sought to win. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Probably the latter interpretation was closer to the showrunners\u2019 conscious intent. But successful art has a way of slipping its ideological leash, and the striking thing about \u201cGirls\u201d is how the mess it portrayed made a mockery of the official narrative of social liberalism, in which prophylactics and graduate degrees and gender equality are supposed to lead smoothly to health, wealth and high-functioning relationships. In large ways and small the show deconstructed those assumptions. The characters\u2019 sex lives were not remotely \u201csafe\u201d; they were porn-haunted and self-destructive, a mess of S.T.D. fears and dubiously consensual incidents and sudden marriages and stupid infidelities. (Abortion was sort-of normalized but also linked to narcissism: The only character to actually have an abortion was extraordinarily blas\u00e9 about it, and then over subsequent episodes revealed as a monster of self-involvement.) Meanwhile the professional world was mostly a series of dead ends and failed experiments, and the idea that sisterhood would conquer all even if relationships with men didn\u2019t work out dissolved as the show continued and its core foursome gradually came apart. Real adulthood did await for Dunham\u2019s character, Hannah Horvath, at the show\u2019s conclusion. But the form it took was almost too heavy-handed in its traditionalist definition of a woman\u2019s growing-up: an unplanned pregnancy, a baby, the absolute obligations of motherhood trumping the trivialities of freedom. True, this was motherhood solo, without a mate or male provider. But the male absence felt more like a signifier of masculine failure than feminine empowerment: After a lecture from an older gay man about how large a father\u2019s absence can loom, Hannah tried to involve the father in the baby\u2019s life, and he ducked out pathetically; the offers from other men to help raise the child dissolved, and what remained as the show ends was a kind of informal and fractious matriarchy \u2014 Hannah and a friend and her mother off Upstate with her infant son, like a tribe of refugees waiting for civilization to reform. Of course the real-life civilization they are part of just elected Donald Trump as president, making all those prestige-drama portraits of toxic patriarchy seem quite relevant to our circumstances again, and the travails of life under social liberalism a little less immediately pressing. But the wheel will turn again, and the relevance of \u201cGirls\u201d will wax as it does. There are many ways to capture our society\u2019s complicated reality; the urban white liberal Brooklynite milieu is indeed, as the show\u2019s haters always stood ready to remind us, a pretty narrow slice of American and Western life. But then again so is the New Jersey mafia or Madison Avenue in its heyday or the Albuquerque drug trade. If those slices, in their different ways, embody the allure and pathologies of old-school male power, the slice that \u201cGirls\u201d portrayed (with, yes, caricature as well as realism) embodies a stronghold of the egalitarian alternative that cultural liberalism aspires to spread to everyone. And the genius, and resonance, and staying power of Lena Dunham\u2019s show rests not only on its artistic quality but on its message to its mostly liberal viewers: You do not have this alternative figured out. \nI invite you to follow me on Twitter (@DouthatNYT) . \n  (@NYTopinion) ,  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "hannah horvath", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lena dunham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hannah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "don draper-esque", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dunham", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hbo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times opinion", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "albuquerque", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madison avenue", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new jersey", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-19T11:34:03.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1cdbbe80c61ee9996126a1f913322e61659a0ab1", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpJ_AJul8iHvRBe1ILbV_kdrtlMK9JaSz9yt44QjpDmENsmqAu00pp7vFvEi3APG4Q-", "site_full": "time.com", "site": "time.com", "site_section": "http://time.com/history/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "History | Time.com", "title": "See Rare John F.

Kennedy and Jackie Photos by Richard Avedon", "text": "To commemorate the 100th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy\u2019s birth on May 29, the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History will display nine photographs of the 35th president, taken by renowned portraitist Richard Avedon. The above photos and contact sheets provide a first look at some of the portraits that will be in the exhibition, which will be on display from May 25 to August 27. Avedon was the only photographer who was allowed to take official photographs of JFK, his wife Jackie and his children, Caroline and John, between the time that he was elected in 1960 and Inauguration Day early the following year. The family sat for this Harper\u2019s Bazaar photo session on Jan. 3, 1961, against the photographer\u2019s signature white backdrop, just a few weeks before moving to the White House, at the Kennedy estate in West Palm Beach, Fla. (Jackie had already been photographed twice by Avedon for that magazine \u2014 in 1947 when she was voted Debutante of the Year and in 1958 as one of \u201cSix Faces of Beauty.\u201d) After the photographs ran in Harper\u2018s, they were seldom displayed or published in the years that followed. In other words, not only are they a rare look at a time in Kennedy\u2019s life, but they are also rarely seen. \u201cAvedon was at the height of his career\u201d when this brief photo session took place, according to Shannon Perich, curator at the National Museum of American History. And, though Kennedy was about to be President, the photographer\u2019s style was powerful too: \u201c[Avedon] changed the way we talked about portraiture,\u201d Perich says, referring to the fact that not every portrait features a smiling face. \u201cHe questioned whether portraits had to be flattering or not.\u201d Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter And if it seems as if the figures aren\u2019t totally focused on the camera, that\u2019s because the photo session was rather chaotic. That day \u2014 Jan. 3, 1961 \u2014 was the same day that the U.S. severed diplomatic ties with Cuba. Dressmakers working on Jackie\u2019s Oleg Cassini dress for the inauguration festivities were apparently there to work on the outfit, too.

The swirled pink, purple and blue syrupy concoction is just about everywhere, and comes at a time when everyone ( well, almost everyone ) is obsessed with colorful unicorn everything. Indeed, the Unicorn Frappuccino is really good-looking \u2013 so much so that it's starting to inspire some people's beauty looks. St. Louis-based hairstylist Caitlin Ford recently posted a video to Instagram of her giving a client a dye job inspired by the viral beverage. Using Lime Crime 's aptly-named \"Unicorn Hair\" color, Ford fused pink, purple, and blue tones into a beautiful ombr\u00e9 that looks good enough to drink. Watch it, here . Ford's Instagram is a treasure trove of rainbow, Lisa Frank-esque dye jobs , so she was clearly just the stylist to execute the look. Kelly Woodford, another hair stylist from Winnipeg, Canada also gave her client a Unicorn Frappuccino-inspired hair color .

Maria Stuart/RedBlkGrl Red.Blk.Grl. formally launched on April 1. \nWhile black Americans are regularly left out of mainstream literary landscapes, when we are afforded racial representation, it\u2019s sometimes limited to tiresome archetypes and narratives. \nPersonal trainer, vlogger and mother Maria Stuart has created an antidote to this issue, at least within the young adult (YA) genre with Red.Blk.Grl. , a subscription box she launched on April 1. She\u2019s one of many black entrepreneurs who\u2019ve recently made efforts to make quality books more accessible to the black community. \n\u201cBlack girls deserve to read about themselves in books,\u201d she told the Huffington Post on Monday. \u201cI want to reach all the bookworms, be they teens or adults and put black YA books written by black women in their hands.\u201d \nThe Red.Blk.Grl. box, which currently has 85 subscribers and is targeted towards young black girls, contains one book as well as additional products, which can be anything self-care items to snacks, that are inspired by the book\u2019s themes. Stuart did a soft launch of the box in January by creating an Instagram account to see if people would respond to the concept of Red.Blk.Grl. Maria Stuart/RedBlkGrl Thus far, the box has 85 subscribers. \nTo emphasize the necessity of the box, Stuart, who is also an aspiring YA writer, mentioned a study conducted by the Cooperative Children\u2019s Book Center (CCBC). According to CCBC, only 278 of the 3,400 children\u2019s books published in 2016 were about black characters. Only 33 percent of those books were by black authors. \n\u201cRepresentation matters... In high school, there is much assigned reading in literature classes, and [black girls] have no choice over what they read,\u201d she said. \n\u201cI recall having a strong desire to find a book with characters that truly felt and thought like me,\u201d she continued. \u201cI often could find something close to it, but there was a constant sense that something was missing from books where none of the characters were black.\u201d \nBut in some YA books that do contain black characters, Stuart said the themes are often repetitive. \n\u201cI think the typical idea when it comes to black YA are things like escaping slavery, overcoming Jim Crow or even gritty urban tales filled with drugs and sex, \u201d Stuart said. \u201cI want to offer more contemporary books that still deal with realities of life, but also that offer sci-fi and afro-futurism,\u201d she continued. \u201cEach book selected must have main characters who demonstrate resilience, who are or learn to be self-reliant .\u201d \nWhile you have to be a subscriber of Red.Blk.Grl. to know which books these narratives will be reflected in, you can sign up for the boxes here .

But his brash manner and evictions of slum communities alienated many in the city of 10 million.\nHe is on trial for blasphemy . In recent months, hundreds of thousands of Indonesians have protested against him in the capital, deriding his Chinese ancestry and calling for him to be imprisoned or killed.\nOPINION: Islam and politics - Indonesia's identity crisis\nOn Thursday, prosecutors will make their sentencing demand in Purnama's trial.\nBlasphemy is a criminal offence in Indonesia and punishable by up to five years in prison.\nBaswedan, a highly educated Muslim politician, capitalised on the backlash against Purnama by courting the support of conservative religious leaders and figures on the radical fringe who opposed electing a non-Muslim.\nThe polarising campaign has given Indonesia's conservative Muslim groups a national stage.\nPurnama won the first round in February but not by a big enough margin to

pulled out of \u201cThe O\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d or Breitbart News are exactly a profile in courage. The basic allegations against Mr. O\u2019Reilly have been known since 2004, when he settled his first lawsuit, but that didn\u2019t stop companies from advertising until more women came forward. Though in some cases, corporate cowardice is a good thing. American business is often accused of producing a bland, monolithic culture \u2014 \u201cDisneyfication\u201d \u2014 but sometimes the fear to offend instills a kind of civility that other spheres of public life lack. Video Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Blunt Style: Cultivating Fans and Foes Mr. O\u2019Reilly forged an often controversial on-air persona over his two-decade career at Fox. He was forced out on Wednesday in the wake of several sexual harassment allegations. By CHRIS CIRILLO, MARK SCHEFFLER and ROBIN STEIN on Publish Date April 19, 2017.

Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed Just compare the inclusive if dull message you hear from corporations with the state of our political culture, where the vilifying of enemies (the elite, welfare queens, the deplorables) is still a critical tool. Donald Trump won an election despite the creepy predatory comments he made on the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape. But Mr. O\u2019Reilly is being shown the door for acting toward women exactly as Mr. Trump had suggested (\u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\u201d). Not that he needed the encouragement, apparently. Steve King, a five-time congressman from Iowa, has plagued the public arena for years with his barely concealed white nationalism. By contrast, when Donald Sterling, the longtime owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, was heard on tape disparaging African-Americans, the N.B.A. revoked his right to ownership and put the team up for auction. The N.B.A. did this even though Mr. Sterling was speaking in private about associates of his ex-girlfriend, who secretly taped him as part of an extortion plot. In the 1980s and \u201990s, companies were more likely to fold under pressure from conservative groups policing the airwaves. \u201cWe are in business to make friends,\u201d said a Coca-Cola spokesman after the company pulled ads from the Fox show \u201cMarried \u2026 With Children.\u201d Today, companies have been pushed in a much more progressive direction, largely because they build their brand on consistent messages not just on television, but also on YouTube and social media. The sheer ubiquity of corporate branding (\u201cJust Do It,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Lovin\u2019 It\u201d) turns consumers into what business scholars call \u201csecondary stakeholders,\u201d people with no financial stake in a company who nevertheless have an interest in the brand.

That\u2019s because the young actor will also be starring in Pilgrimage , where he\u2019s playing part of a group of 13th-century monks tasked with transporting an ancient relic across the Irish landscape. Ahead of that film\u2019s upcoming theatrical debut at this year\u2019s Tribeca Film Festival , we now have its first trailer above. On the Irish coast in A.D. 1209, Holland and his fellow monks \u2014 including Richard Armitage\u2019s leader and Jon Bernthal\u2019s mute \u2014 set out on a quest to bring a legendary artifact with biblical origins to Rome, where they believe it will be safe from those who seek to wield its power. Their journey quickly turns into a perilous one, with all manner of military men and scoundrels attempting to snatch their cargo. A gritty, medieval thriller, Pilgrimage will aim to provide Holland with a headlining turn far removed from his upcoming Marvel heroics when it debuts this Sunday at Tribeca in New York.

A new college course presents Appalachian history through Ms. Parton\u2019s life. Credit Gary Settle/The New York Times The first thing you need to know is that this is no easy elective. If you want to learn about the country music superstar Dolly Parton, you\u2019d better come prepared.\nA course called Dolly\u2019s America at the University of Tennessee \u2019s main campus in Knoxville is devoted to the life story of Ms. Parton, who hails from nearby Sevier County in the eastern part of the state.\nBut this is much more than a surface-level study of a popular musician, said Lynn Sacco, the associate professor who teaches the course. It\u2019s a thesis seminar meant for history students in the honors program, and it\u2019s meant to give students a new way of understanding Appalachia\u2019s modern history and Ms. Parton\u2019s role in it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really kind of a nerdy class,\u201d Dr. Sacco said.\nThe second thing you need to know is that for many natives of eastern Tennessee, Ms. Parton, 71, is known for much, much more than just music. She is an icon for a place that outsiders can sometimes underestimate, said Carson Hollingsworth, the student body president at the University of Tennessee Knoxville.\n \u201cI think there are some stereotypes associated with the area, especially in rural Appalachia,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s great that we have a figure like Dolly Parton who comes from the area and is able to shed light on it and be an ambassador.\u201d\n The course, which was taught for the first time last year and will be taught again in the fall, gained attention when Ms. Parton herself tweeted about it last week.\nFrom the girl voted in High School 'least likely to succeed' this sure is a blessing! https://t.co/3EnB8ixB4f\n\u2014 Dolly Parton (@DollyParton) April 10, 2017 Through her representatives, Ms. Parton declined an interview.\nAccording to Dr. Sacco\u2019s syllabus, the seminar looks at a history of the 20th century not from the vantage point of elites, but through the eyes of Ms. Parton, \u201ca poor white girl born in midcentury Appalachia.\u201d\nIt has a wealth of reading materials, including Ms. Parton\u2019s own 1994 book, \u201c Dolly: My Life and Other Unfinished Business ,\u201d and a slew of contemporary articles from periodicals such as The Tennessee Magazine , The Knoxville News Sentinel and The New York Times . Their topics range from child labor in the early 20th century to the Kennedy-era Appalachian Regional Commission and modern economic anxiety in the region.\nGet the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Privacy Policy The syllabus also includes plenty of videos of historic footage from YouTube .\nThe Moonshiner / 1904 Video by History VA Ms. Parton, born to a poor family in Sevier County in 1946, was only a child when she started singing at local television and radio stations. She moved to Nashville right after high school to pursue a music career. In 1974, she scored four number one hits on the Billboard country chart \u2013 including \u201c Jolene \u201d and \u201c I Will Always Love You \u201d \u2014 and she hasn\u2019t stopped, winning awards, for singing, songwriting and acting, that include Kennedy Center Honors in 2006 and a Grammy lifetime achievement award in 2011.\nDr. Sacco, who is from Chicago and moved to Tennessee in 2004, said she was struck by the ardor of Ms. Parton\u2019s fan base in Tennessee. \u201cShe is beloved here,\u201d she said. \u201cIf she would run for governor, no one would oppose her.\u201d\nMs. Parton\u2019s Dollywood theme park, about an hour\u2019s drive from the Knoxville campus, is a popular attraction in the region, pulling millions of visitors annually to the Smoky Mountains. \u201cYou want to feel like you\u2019re doing something good,\u201d Ms. Parton said to The Tennessean during a 2015 visit to the park. \u201cI really feel proud as a citizen of this area, and just being a daughter of the hills here.\u201d\nThe university, in particular, has close ties to the country star: It awarded her an honorary doctoral degree in 2009.\n During that ceremony, she took the stage in a sparkling, tasseled pink dress to perform songs and to give a commencement speech. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful for my life, but if I had but one wish for you, it would be for you to dream more,\u201d she said.\nDolly Parton Delivers Commencement Address at the University of Tennessee 2009 Video by University of Tennessee, Knoxville Then Ms. Parton changed into a tailor-made, figure-hugging black robe to accept her honorary degree.\nMs. Parton is also known for her philanthropic work. Some call her \u201cThe Book Lady\u201d for her program, called Imagination Library, which distributes free books through the mail to children.\nAs recently as December, she hosted a three-hour telethon to raise millions of dollars after a wildfire raged through Sevier County , killing 14. Ms. Parton promised $1,000 a month , for up to six months, to families displaced by the blaze.\n\u201cShe did a lot of work with relief efforts here,\u201d said Mr. Hollingsworth. \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of country music, but I\u2019m a big fan of her.\u201d\nThe university said 87 percent of its undergraduate population is from Tennessee. \u201cUsing pop culture as a way to talk about how to use history sources was actually the goal of the course,\u201d Dr. Sacco said.\n\u201cBut the personal part is for students to see that history is not just about dead presidents. It\u2019s one way for them to tie in a lot of personal feelings about coming from East Tennessee, from Appalachia.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

By EMILY SHESKIN on Publish Date April 18, 2017. Photo by Emily Sheskin. Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed When I initially read about Jesselyn Silva, known as \u201cJessZilla,\u201d the ambitious young boxer featured in this film, I loved the idea of profiling a young girl\u2019s journey in a male-dominated combat sport. It\u2019s no secret that women\u2019s boxing has nowhere near the participants \u2014 or the money, or the audience \u2014 that men\u2019s boxing has. Broadcasters of the sport generally feature men; the Amateur International Boxing Association has gone so far as to encourage women to box in skirts. The middleweight Olympic champion boxer, Claressa Shields of Flint, Mich., reached the sport\u2019s apogee and still struggles to make herself \u201cmarketable\u201d to sponsors that help translate athletic success to financial reward. There simply is less demand, it seems, to watch girls who like to fight. But Jesselyn boxes because she genuinely loves the sport. She\u2019s only 10, and even though she says she\u2019s dealt with unsupportive schoolmates, she has her eyes on the Olympics. Her odds are decent \u2014 it\u2019s rare for girls to start boxing so young. Though more sign up with age, for now, she mostly spars with boys. But beyond considering the challenges that Jesselyn will face navigating her way through a sport where her presence will generally be an anomaly, I was captivated by the dynamic between her and her father, Pedro. As a filmmaker, I often see profiles of high achieving kids in sports that leave me wondering where their parents fit in all this. When I met them, I immediately understood that Pedro is not the kind of dad who is pushing his daughter to do something she isn\u2019t interested in and, instead, is following his daughter\u2019s lead, supporting her as best he can. Given that this is a film about boxing, I felt it was essential to create a nuanced portrait of their family and to ward off superficial criticisms like, \u201cHow could a man let his cute little girl do such a violent sport?\u201d I thought it was fascinating, for example, that when Pedro says in the film that he wants his daughter\u2019s boxing to end at a certain age, she begins arguing with him about the success she\u2019s looking to have. All families navigate choices like these to some extent. It was clear to me that Jesselyn\u2019s drive was fueled by the love and support of her father. It was also obvious that Pedro is a huge part of Jesselyn\u2019s story, but in no way resembles those hovering \u201chelicopter parents\u201d we hear so much about today. I hope the end result is a work that is as much about girls breaking athletic barriers as parents fostering drive in their children \u2014 encouraging them to do what they love, and to do their best. \nEmily Sheskin is a New York City based filmmaker and editor making a feature film about Jesselyn Silva.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jesselyn silva", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "emily sheskin", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "claressa shields", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesselyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pedro", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "amateur international boxing association", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mich.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "flint", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-19T05:12:41.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "53064303dd9f308cc3149da925c4e130e72c0fde", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9YzE9LUYmiEoCcR19M20LwS3_4kmlvJfhV8KF_xsND2aUPJ0x45wTBzvmUdKm9rBP_apK39WXXo8V0RlFik37zvBYP01FZtCSo9HQ2arCshw--", "site_full": "www.vox.com", "site": "vox.com", "site_section": "http://www.vox.com/rss/index.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Vox -  All", "title": "The March for Science, explained", "title_full": "The March for Science, explained", "published": "2017-04-19T20:10:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hnlMocPPY9ZEemXF0KXvMcFGCD0=/0x0:3200x1778/1080x600/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54325533/GettyImages_643437328.0.jpg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 902, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 973, "comments": 0, "shares": 973}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "53064303dd9f308cc3149da925c4e130e72c0fde", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9YzE9LUYmiEoCcR19M20LwS3_4kmlvJfhV8KF_xsND2aUPJ0x45wTBzvmUdKm9rBP_apK39WXXo8V0RlFik37zvBYP01FZtCSo9HQ2arCshw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Brian Resnick", "published": "2017-04-19T20:10:00.000+03:00", "title": "The March for Science, explained", "text": "The March for Science, explained Thousands will demonstrate on Saturday in the name of evidence-based decision-making. Scientists, science advocates and community members gather in Copley Square in Boston on Feb. 19, 2017 for a Rally to Stand up for Science Jessica Rinaldi/The Boston Globe via Getty Images Brace yourself, DC: The nerds are marching in. On Earth Day, April 22, thousands of people will descend on the National Mall in Washington, DC, and take to the streets in cities across the globe \u2014 in the name of science. Inspired by the success of the January 21 Women\u2019s March on Washington, the March for Science will celebrate the scientific method and advocate for evidence-based decision-making in all levels of government. Though the event\u2019s website doesn\u2019t explicitly mention Trump, it\u2019s a protest of his administration\u2019s policies, including his proposal to cut billions in funding for scientific research. The march is likely to draw a lively crowd \u2014 and the nerdiest protest signs you can imagine. Here\u2019s what you need to know about it. What will happen at the March for Science? On April 22, science-friendly individuals will gather on the National Mall, and in dozens of satellite marches across the United States and even around the globe . The Earth Day Network \u2014 the nonprofit that organizes Earth Day events every year \u2014 has taken the lead on programming for the march. The main event will be co-hosted by Questlove (of the Roots and The Tonight Show ) and Derek Muller (who runs a popular science YouTube channel). Jon Batiste and Stay Human (the band for Stephen Colbert\u2019s Late Show ) will serve as the house band. And there will be four main attractions. 1) A roster of speakers and science heroes The main march programming will take place on the north side of the Washington Monument, with a main stage facing the South Lawn of the White House. The event begins at 8 am. Around 10 am, a series of speakers will take to the stage. They include: Bill Nye \u2014 you know, the science guy Mona Hanna-Attisha \u2014 a pediatrician who played a crucial role in blowing the whistle on the water crisis in Flint, Michigan Rush Holt\u2014Former congressman and current CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science Lydia Villa-Komaroff \u2014 a biologist who helped discover the process by which bacteria can produce human insulin Christiana Figueres \u2014 one of the key architects of the Paris climate agreement (You can see a partial list of speakers here. I\u2019m told there will be more added as the event draws nearer.) 2) A series of \u201cteach-ins\u201d The march programming puts a strong emphasis on education and helping the demonstrators think about how to get further involved in science activism. The Earth Day Network is setting up a series of 20-plus \u201cteach-ins,\u201d which participants can register to attend. The vibe of these will be part science fair, part TED talk. They start at 9 am. These teach-ins will focus on specific topics in science and science communication, and how to move the needle on them. Teach-ins include a sessions on \u201cHow to Stop Your Climate Denialist Uncle in His Tracks,\u201d \u201cProtecting Wildlife in an Era of Climate Change,\u201d and one giving marchers tips on how to \u201cprotect forests from hungry beetles\u201d and \u201ctrack threatened wildlife.\u201d Find more information on the teach-ins here . 3) A literal march toward the Capitol At 2 pm, the crowd will begin a march down Constitution Avenue toward the Capitol building (it\u2019s a little over a mile). 4) The nerdiest protest signs imaginable In Boston in February, the Union of Concerned Scientists co-sponsored a Stand Up for Science rally in Copley Square, and it felt like a prelude to the Science March. The people there brought signs that said things like \u201cIf you\u2019re not part of the solution, you\u2019re part of the precipitate\u201d and \u201cTrump\u2019s team are like atoms: they make up everything!\u201d It feels safe to say you can expect more of the same on Saturday. Where are the satellite marches taking place? There are 518 official satellite marches in the United States and across the world, from Quezon City in the Philippines to Blantyre, Malawi . You can s earch for the satellite marches here . There are marches in all 50 US states. (There will also be a live stream of the DC event .) Scientists have more reason than ever to march against Trump At the very least, the Science March will be a celebration of the scientific method and its ability to inform policy. With Trump in the Oval Office, scientists have been watching their disciplines lose their seats \u2014 perhaps permanently \u2014 at the nation\u2019s decision-making tables. The hope is that the march will leave an impression: Science matters. Already Trump is calling for a dramatic reduction in the amount of money the US government spends on scientific research, he\u2019s scaling back efforts at the Environmental Protection Agency to combat climate change, and overall, he seems to disregard or not seek out advice from scientific efforts. He has yet to name a top White House science adviser, and it\u2019s unclear if he ever will . Meanwhile, science skeptics in Congress are emboldened. The House recently passed two bills that (under the guise of transparency) would stifle scientific research and expertise at the EPA. It\u2019s the gravity of these concerns that helped the March attract support from the scientific mainstream: Major science advocacy groups and publishers, such as the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Geophysical Union, the Association for Psychological Science, and many others , have endorsed the march and are encouraging their members to attend. What will the march accomplish? Scientists have long been active in Washington, putting pressure on Congress and advocating for funding for their work. Groups like the AAAS and AGU do a lot of this work. But the grassroots movement that\u2019s propelling the March for Science is a bit different. It\u2019s like an awakening of \u201cscientist\u201d as a political identity. At the very least, the event may inspire some of its attendees to go on to greater political action. \u201cProtest is also an opportunity to create what we call \u2018collective identity,\u2019\u201d Dana R. Fisher, a sociologist who studies protest movements, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting sympathizers, people who agree with the cause, to be activists.\u201d The marchers may then be more ready to mobilize when or if the administration truly does lash out against the nation\u2019s scientists. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to take the energy and excitement from the march, go back home, and carry it into legislatures offices, and hold them accountable,\u201d says Shaughnessy Naughton, a chemist who runs 314 Action, a political action committee dedicated to getting more people with a science background to run for public office. (Just two days before the march, 314 is holding an information session for scientists thinking about making the leap into public service.) There\u2019s also a consequence the scientists have to wrestle with: A March for Science could be self-defeating. If the public gets the impression that scientists are liberal crusaders, it will be a hard mental image to break. (More on that here .) Many scientists have long been hesitant to get into the political fray. And some worry that further activism will make future fights for science funding more difficult and more partisan. But that concern won\u2019t stop thousands of scientists and allies from demonstrating. And it could be just the beginning. Is this the same thing as the People\u2019s Climate March? No. That\u2019s a separate event taking place the next week, on April 29. It will focus more on climate issues (duh), but it will overlap with the Science March in the sentiment that the Trump administration is not heeding scientific experts\u2019 calls for action on climate change. Who started the March for Science, and why? On the day of the Women\u2019s March on Washington, Jonathan Berman, a biology postdoc at the University of Texas Health Science Center, was reading a Reddit thread about an article headlined \u201cAll References to Climate Change Have Been Deleted From the White House Website .\u201d One comment caught his eye: \u201cThere needs to be a Scientists' March on Washington.\u201d \u201cThe only way to make things happen is to do them,\u201d Berman told me in February . So he purchased the web domain MarchForScience.com, and set up a Facebook and Twitter account. The march will \u201csend the message that we need to have decisions being made based on a thoughtful evaluation of evidence,\u201d he says. And all of a sudden, he had a movement. (Some 521,000 had \u201cliked\u201d the march on Facebook as of Tuesday.) But the march organizers are also trying to thread a tough needle with their goals: opposing the anti-science policies of the Trump administration, while furthering the message that science is not a partisan issue. (How precisely to thread the needle on these issues \u2014 and how strongly to add issues of diversity, identity, and inclusion to the roster of march causes \u2014 has been an ongoing debate around the event.) As the group\u2019s website asserts : Anti-science agendas and policies have been advanced by politicians on both sides of the aisle, and they harm everyone \u2014 without exception. Science should neither serve special interests nor be rejected based on personal convictions. At its core, science is a tool for seeking answers. It can and should influence policy and guide our long-term decision-making. How many people will show up? Unclear. The March for Science isn\u2019t releasing any estimates, though there is a lot of interest in the event. In the week after its founding, the Science March received 40,000 emails from people who wanted to volunteer. Considering the march in DC, and those around the country, it seems that thousands \u2014 maybe even tens of thousands \u2014 may show up.

The American singer is facing the wrath of Indian trolls after posting a picture of the Hindu Goddess Kali on Instagram. She captioned it \"Current mood.\" Uploaded on the photo-sharing platform roughly 10 hours ago, the post has been liked over 194,000 times. But one look at the comments section reveals a series of abusive and hateful messages left by Indian Instagram users. A post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry) on Apr 18, 2017 at 6:57pm PDT This person was quick to see the hate that would soon be hurled Ms Perry's way:\"You do realise it can have adverse effects. She is a goddess. I suggest you remove it before the ones who get offended start retaliating. I am sure your intention is clear. Do the damage control before the damage happens,\" warns Instagram user khalidwani.Here are just some of the kinds of comments being left on the post:\"How ridiculous this? You don't have permission to upload a picture of our goddess on this f**king social media and embarrassing our culture,\" writes Instagram user the_j_stark.\"You're making fun of our goddess...Delete your account,\" writes another user.\"Everyone just report this post,\" writes user aham_aktiwari.But many people are now countering the negative comments\"I'm an Indian and guess what? I'm not offended by this (I know!). Just thought of letting it be known, if anyone cares that is. Lest the world starts thinking every Indian on social media has anger issues. Well, now you know. Not all of us. But yeah, most of us,\" writes Instagram user learnerdy.\"I don't understand, what's in there to be offended, I am a very proud Indian but not at all offended by this,\" writes someone who goes by the username medude28.Instagram user ishagupta981 adds: \"Come on everyone...it's nothing to get offended about..she meant she is angry and furious as the goddess in the pic. She didn't disrespect.

(Photo: Ron Verhorst/Redferns) More When Michael Pagnotta launched his own PR firm, Reach Media, in early 1990s, Prince was his very first client. Now, more than a quarter-century later and one year after Prince\u2019s tragic death, Pagnotta remembers, in this exclusive personal essay for Yahoo Music, a fateful day in Australia when Prince confronted him and gave him some advice that changed his life and career.\n\u201cMichael, get your pen and paper and meet me in my dressing room.\u201d\nPrince was a man of famously few words, spending most his time \u2014 and mine, when I was representing him \u2014 refusing interviews rather than granting them. But as the first anniversary of his death arrives, I have had occasion to ponder a few words he did say to me. Words that changed my life.\nThe year was 1992. We were in Australia as part of the Diamonds and Pearls concert tour and things were going well, at least I thought so, until Prince came up behind me one night backstage and \u201csuggested\u201d a meeting. Before I could even turn around to respond, he was gone, vanishing as he often did \u2014 sometimes behind a wall of bodyguards, other times into thin air, like magic, leaving you wondering where the hell he\u2019d gone.\nI\u2019d figured out pretty quickly in my relationship with Paisley Park that the less actual personal contact you had with Prince, the better off you were. It meant he was cool with you and what you were doing. This meeting wasn\u2019t a good sign, and I started to think about what time the next plane home might be leaving and whether or not I\u2019d be on it.\nRelated: Prince Deliverance EP Blocked as Estate, Producers Spar in Court\nI did as he said, and got a pen and paper and headed to his dressing room, running obsessively through every \u201cI\u2019m sorry and I will do better!\u201d scenario I could imagine. Prince\u2019s half-brother and right-hand man Dwayne met me at the dressing room door and instructed me to enter and sit. Prince would be right with me.\nMichael Pagnotta\u2019s Prince mementos from over the years. (Photo courtesy of Michael Pagnotta) More Prince\u2019s dressing room was just as you\u2019d imagine it: a serene space decked out, if memory serves, in gold statuettes, scented candles, incense, caftans, throws, carpets. Splashes of yellow, purple, and gold everywhere. Part temple, part ancient desert caravan tent straight out of Ben Hur . In the center of the room was a couch, and I sat. The seat was broken and I sunk in, feeling like I might just fall through to the floor.\nAfter a few anxious minutes, Prince walked in, still dressed in his canary-yellow jumpsuit, do-rag, and boots from the show. The man had just performed a two-and-a-half-hour gig and he was perfectly coiffed and done up, looking like he\u2019d barely broken a sweat. If anything, I was the one who was sweating. Prince was a small guy, but with me sinking ever deeper into the broken seat cushions like a dying man in quicksand and having to look up at him, he looked like a giant. Intimidating.\nThere were no pleasantries. He got right down to business. He began to shift his weight from one leg to another, in a slow, metronomic dance as he interrogated me.\n\u201cHow many T-shirts we sell tonight?\u201d he asked, staring me right in the eye.\nThe question surprised me. I didn\u2019t sell T-shirts for the tour and had no access to the merch data, especially before the show had even settled. I didn\u2019t know, couldn\u2019t have known, but he made me feel like I should have. He was good at keeping people off balance.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said honestly and sheepishly.\nPrince let the uncertainty hang in the air for a second and started to speed up his dance, circling me as I sat, looking less like a canary in his yellow outfit than a bird of prey. He came around the front of me and stopped, looked me dead in the eye again.\nRead More \u201cHow many programs we sell?\u201d\nTo say I was freaking at this point would be an understatement. I didn\u2019t sell T-shirts or programs. Surely he knew that. The shows had sold out quickly and fans were stoked to see him and his new band, the New Power Generation. The singles were breaking strong at radio and the album was setting up to be Prince\u2019s best seller since Purple Rain \u2014 no small achievement, and one in which I took a lot of pride. Everything was going well, including the merch sales, as far as I knew. Where he was going, I still couldn\u2019t figure. Without meaning to be a wiseass, I answered with a clarification.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you know this, but I don\u2019t do merch for you. I do publicity.\u201d\nWrong answer. He stopped dancing in mid-twirl, turned his back toward me, then spun suddenly around, faced me and pointed his finger accusingly.\n\u201cYou trying to say that\u2019s not your job?\u201d\nI tried to respond with something positive about what my job actually was, as far as I was concerned.\n\u201cThe press has been\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou gonna talk, or you wanna listen?\u201d\nHe slowed down his question, emphasizing each word.\n\u201cAre you trying to say \u2026 that\u2019s not \u2026 your job ?\u201d\nAnd then it hit me. I\u2019d watched him record through the night, jam for hours in tiny clubs after grueling arena gigs, rehearse the horn section for two hours over four bars of music, replace band members of opening act Carmen Electra (yes, that Carmen Electra) with members of the NPG one by one, adjust the soundboard, and leave explicit Do Not Touch orders for a professional soundman he was paying to do sound on tour. In the studio, and on stage, everything was his job. The band, the instruments, the sound, the lights, the costumes, the set, the visuals. Likewise, he was saying to me that everything was my job. Performance, publicity, and programs were all connected, all part of the same larger whole. It was a true light-bulb moment for me. In an age of specialization, of boundaries, of not wanting to step on anyone else\u2019s toes, Prince insisted on things getting done no matter who had to do it. Or how. Your job description was: everything .\n\u201cIt\u2019s all my job,\u201d I replied simply, finally getting it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all your job,\u201d he repeated, flashing a sly half-smile and pointing to the door. \u201cBye.\u201d\nEven the conversation had been a performance for him. But a learning experience for me.\nI walked out of the dressing room with my head spinning. I was a young publicist whose first client in his own business was one of the biggest pop stars in the world. I\u2019d been feeling pretty good about myself and the way I did my job. But that conversation changed everything about the way I looked at myself and my business. There have been countless recollections from fans and critics and colleagues of Prince\u2019s, all citing how inspirational he and his music were to them and to the world. Thankfully, the reunited Revolution and New Power Generation will keep his greatest legacy, his music, alive in the coming months and years. But when I think of Prince, it\u2019s not only the inspiration but the perspiration I think about. For me, you can sum up his legacy in one word: Work.\nI\u2019d come into Prince\u2019s orbit after he\u2019d already achieved his greatest commercial and critical successes \u2014 1999 , Purple Rain , Sign O\u2019 the Times \u2014 and just following the relative disappointment of the Graffiti Bridge album and film. It was the very early \u201990s. Music was changing. Prince\u2019s brand of funky eclecticism was on the verge of falling out of fashion. Hip-hop and grunge were taking over. A lesser artist, or less competitive one, might have thrown up his hands, given up, or given in, content to rest on a well-earned reputation. But instead, Prince changed everything.\nHe formed a new band, the New Power Generation, and forged a new sound \u2014 adding Tony Mosley, a rapper, to the mix, finding a place for hip-hop in his new music. He changed his image, complete with new updo hairstyle and dandified outfits designed specifically for him in his own wardrobe department at Paisley Park. Flannel shirts and baggy jeans, trends at that time, simply would not do. He brought dancers Diamond and Pearl on board to up the eye candy quotient in the \u201cGett Off\u201d and \u201cCream\u201d videos and in live performances. Finally he added a belly dancer, Mayte, his muse and future wife, to the NPG mix, instructing me to tell press at various tour stops that he\u2019d kidnapped her from a foreign land.\nRelated: Mayte Garcia Opens Up About Child She Lost With Prince: \u2018I Don\u2019t Think He Ever Got Over It\u2019\nEach of these changes were tools he gave me. Tools I used to help Diamonds and Pearls become the second-biggest album of Prince\u2019s career. The Prince from the Dirty Mind and Purple Rain and Batman days was gone, replaced by a butt-baring ringmaster of the funkiest circus in the universe. Yes, he\u2019d changed everything. Eventually, he would even change his name. But that\u2019s another story.\nIn the end, work was the key to Prince\u2019s success, perhaps as much as his raw talent. You don\u2019t leave an immense recorded catalog or a vault with hundreds, maybe thousands, of unreleased songs unless you work . You don\u2019t earn a reputation as one of the greatest musicians, stage performers, and songwriters ever unless you work.\nAnother client of mine, George Michael, once complained to me that Prince didn\u2019t \u201cedit\u201d himself well enough , releasing too much, too fast. I think George missed the point. Sometimes, it is about output \u2014 asking your fans to drink not from a fountain, but from a fire hose. Do it, label and critics be damned, and move on to the next thing. Prince did that, whether the chart-keepers were paying attention or not, in a decades-long burst of Warholian productivity. Is there any one of us, now that he is gone, who wishes Prince had taken it all easier, had worked less?\nIt\u2019s all your job . Teamwork is fine, but every team needs a leader. If you want to be successful, you have to be aware of it all, stay on top of it all, be responsible for it all, willing to do it all. That was his daunting message, and over the years it has served me well. So the words that I\u2019d once feared might be a dire warning turned out instead to be life-changing wisdom that I have carried with me ever since. Much has been made of Prince\u2019s media silence in those years, but that simple lesson is more memorable to me than anything he ever said to Rolling Stone , Spin , Vibe , or any other interview. In fact, it\u2019s what I remember most.\nWhen it came to business, I\u2019m proud and humbled to say everything I needed to know about the music business, and maybe even life, I learned from working with Prince.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ujGAbxl3BFHzjz1az_hTbg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/4854e498c4734563c4f525a496b56e03"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "prince", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ron verhorst/redferns", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ben hur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dwayne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "batman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carmen electra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mayte garcia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george michael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chael pagnotta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pagnotta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mayte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony mosley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new power generation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "npg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rolling stone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "producers spar in court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reach media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yahoo music", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pearl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paisley park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-20T21:28:17.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "14625e9eeac0435967129f1a5c9af89b818089de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOitplr04Ug5ns4ocPxReMcyoSnnNXUtwelN4X4RWL9beT0CuRlDUwoOrhGjBn6QxgqbzJL.bvLkdMgI3ePHFcpi", "site_full": "www.huffingtonpost.com", "site": "huffingtonpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/feeds/verticals/politics/news.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Politics News on The Huffington Post", "title": "Betsy DeVos Is Visiting A Public School This Week With One Of Her Famous Foes", "title_full": "Betsy DeVos Is Visiting A Public School This Week With One Of Her Famous Foes", "published": "2017-04-20T00:21:08.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/58f7ccde2600003596c46943.jpeg?cache=nk76fnhmbi", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 139, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 971, "comments": 16, "shares": 971}, "gplus": {"shares": 2}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "14625e9eeac0435967129f1a5c9af89b818089de", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOitplr04Ug5ns4ocPxReMcyoSnnNXUtwelN4X4RWL9beT0CuRlDUwoOrhGjBn6QxgqbzJL.bvLkdMgI3ePHFcpi", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Rebecca Klein", "published": "2017-04-20T00:21:08.000+03:00", "title": "Betsy DeVos Is Visiting A Public School This Week With One Of Her Famous Foes", "text": "04/19/2017 04:55 pm ET | Updated 1 day ago Betsy DeVos Is Visiting A Public School This Week With One Of Her Famous Foes She and Randi Weingarten will be setting aside their differences on a trip to Ohio. By Rebecca Klein Getty Images American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten, left, and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos, right, will visit an Ohio school district together this week. 610 \nWhen   first nominated Betsy DeVos for U.S. secretary of education in November, labor leader Randi Weingarten did not mince words. \n\u201cThe president-elect, in his selection of Betsy DeVos, has chosen the most ideological, anti-public education nominee put forward since President Carter created a Cabinet-level Department of Education,\u201d stated Weingarten, who is president of the American Federation of Teachers, the nation\u2019s second-largest teachers union. \u201cDeVos is everything Donald Trump said is wrong in America.\u201d \nBut on Thursday, DeVos and Weingarten are attempting to find common ground by visiting a public school together. In February, shortly after DeVos was confirmed, the pair decided they would travel to a school of the other\u2019s choice . \nThe goal, according to the American Federation of Teachers, is to show DeVos the possibilities of great public schools, as opposed to charter schools and private schools. DeVos also invited Weingarten to visit a school with her \u2015 such as a charter school \u2015 although such a visit has not yet been announced. \nThe pair will be touring Van Wert City Schools, a public school district in Ohio. While the school district has a mixed academic record, it has deeply invested in strategies that engage community members and serve the social and emotional needs of children. It is an example of a school district that would be hurt by the passage of Trump\u2019s proposed education budget , which slashes federal funding for education by $9 billion, according to an op-ed Weingarten wrote in a local Ohio outlet, the Times Bulletin Media . \n\u201cWhen the federal budget gets cut and the state can\u2019t make up the difference, the burden lands on the local district. But here in Van Wert, teachers and school officials have already stretched the budget as far as possible. Anything cut now would destroy the programs and strategies that make Van Wert\u2019s schools great,\u201d wrote Weingarten. \nVan Wert City Schools have high graduation rates and received stellar marks for students\u2019 academic growth on a report card issued by the state. However, on that same report card, the school system received poor grades for elementary school literacy rates and standardized test scores . \nBut the school district, in which most high school students qualify for free or reduced price lunch , has implemented a number of effective strategies, like pre-kindergarten and project-based learning, according to Weingarten\u2019s op-ed. \nLocated in rural Ohio \u2015 in a county that voted heavily for Trump \u2015 it also represents the type of district that might not benefit from the increased school choice programs DeVos favors. DeVos is a major proponent of charter schools and private school choice programs. However, rural districts like Van Wert lack the infrastructure to easily implement such programs. Notably, DeVos received opposition from two Republican senators during her confirmation process because of the issues school choice programs pose in rural districts . \nJeff Hood, the president of the local Van Wert Federation of Teachers, suggested to Weingarten in February that DeVos come visit the district, according to the Toledo Blade . He said he hopes the visit is about education, as opposed to politics, but suggested DeVos\u2019 agenda might not be in line with Van Wert residents\u2019 priorities. \n\u201cThe people who put Donald Trump in office live in Van Wert County, and they live in all the other \u2018Van Werts,\u2019\u201d Hood told the outlet. \u201cCharter schools and private schools and vouchers are not going to mean much to people in Van Wert.\u201d Do you have information you want to share with the Huffington Post?

Seidemann and James Vinocur \u2014 introduced witnesses who said that Mr. Hernandez had made a similar confession to people at a prayer retreat shortly after Etan disappeared. In addition, his former wife and a childhood friend testified that Mr. Hernandez had told them in the early 1980s that he had killed a boy in New York City, although he gave different details. In the end, the jurors accepted Mr. Hernandez\u2019s words as credible. One juror said that Mr. Hernandez might have a personality disorder but that none of the experts who had testified convinced the juror that the disorder could make a man confess to something he had invented. \u201cWe think he could tell right from wrong,\u201d the juror, Michael Castellon, said. \u201cHe could tell fantasy from reality.\u201d At a news conference outside the courthouse, Mr. Patz said the sentencing brought an end to the uncertainty over Etan\u2019s fate, which he and his wife thought would never come. \u201cThere were so many false leads, so many blind alleys, so many years went by \u2014 we didn\u2019t know if it would ever happen,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I know what the face of evil looks like, and he\u2019s finally convicted.\u201d Breaking with normal practice, all three prosecutors addressed the judge before the sentencing, portraying Mr. Hernandez as a deceitful man with a history of cocaine abuse and domestic violence who had tried to avoid the consequences of his act and had feigned mental illness after he was arrested. \u201cHe single-handedly caused many families to fear their neighbors and their parks and their playgrounds,\u201d Ms. Illuzzi said. \u201cHe is the stuff that nightmares are made of.\u201d A version of this article appears in print on April 19, 2017, on Page A21 of the New York edition with the headline: Man Convicted of Murder in Patz Case Is Sentenced to 25 Years to Life.

Sloan, the chief executive of Wells Fargo, last month. After a sham accounts scandal, he said, \u201cwe had to fundamentally change how we are organized.\u201d Credit Richard Drew/Associated Press For years, as Wells Fargo secretly set up millions of fake bank and credit card accounts without customers\u2019 consent, the bank\u2019s federal regulator was learning of hundreds of whistle-blower complaints against the company for its sales tactics. But that regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , did not act. In a damning, 15-page report published on Wednesday, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency admitted that its oversight of Wells Fargo was \u201cuntimely and ineffective.\u201d The report said the agency failed to spot clues that would have allowed it to connect the dots in one of the most brazen banking scandals of the recent past. Since 2005, Wells Fargo\u2019s board had received regular notifications indicating that \u201cthe highest level\u201d of ethics line complaints and employee firings were related to sales integrity violations, according to the report. It also said that even though the regulating agency started receiving those reports around early 2010, there was no evidence that it adequately followed up on those concerns. And even after the regulator confronted a Wells Fargo executive in 2010 about 700 cases of whistle-blower complaints, the regulator did not require the bank to provide adequate analysis, according to the report, which was issued by the comptroller\u2019s office of enterprise governance and its ombudsman. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency recently removed its top Wells Fargo examiner, Bradley Linskens, from a position in which he led 60 regulatory supervisors. The regulating agency\u2019s review follows a similarly harsh report from a panel of Wells Fargo\u2019s board members, published last week, that identified red flags that should have indicated that something was awry years ago. An increasing number of customers seemed to be opening accounts without ever making a deposit, for instance. And as early as 2004, a manager with Wells Fargo\u2019s internal investigations group noticed the so-called sales gaming cases, in which bankers tinkered inappropriately with customer accounts, had risen to about 680 in 2004, from 63 in 2000.

And yet this Friday\u2019s debut of The Promise is shaping up to be a big loser on the balance sheet, at least according to this weekend\u2019s box office preview at The Hollywood Reporter . In her forecast, THR \u2019s Pamela McClintock writes that things are looking exceedingly bleak for the Bale-Isaac romantic drama, which is set against the backdrop of Armenian genocide. Produced for $100 million by the late Kirk Kerkorian via his Survival Pictures, The Promise is predicted to net only about $4 million domestically, which \u2014 considering what that means for its prospects in subsequent weeks \u2014 is a doomsday scenario. While producers are downplaying such a situation, claiming that what\u2019s really important is that all theatrical receipts go toward funding nonprofits (including Elton John\u2019s AIDS foundation ), there\u2019s no way to truly sugarcoat its expected box-office crash and burn. Eric Esrailian, now in charge at Survival, told THR where he places the blame: \u201cIt became clear that the government of Turkey was going to have an influence on this movie. One of the most insidious realities of our existence in the United States is that foreign governments can control art. I would say at the highest levels from different studios, we were just basically told that no matter how good the film would be, it was never going be released by certain companies. I think that that\u2019s truly shameful, but it\u2019s just a reality that we had to deal with.\u201d What\u2019s left unsaid by Esrailian, however, is the more basic reality that, as large-scale film budgets soar, so too do the financial risks. Deadline recently reported that the Scarlett Johansson -led Ghost in the Shell remake stands to lose around $60 million (after costing close to $250 million to make/promote). And both Ghost in the Shell and The Promise come on the heels of a 2016 in which numerous tentpole spectaculars took a huge financial bath , including Alice Through the Looking Glass (estimated $70 million loss), Allied (somewhere in the $75M-$90M range), The BFG (close to $100 million), and Ben-Hur (as much as $120 million). That studio filmmaking is a dicey financial proposition is nothing new; movie moguls have been producing epic flops for decades. But with costs only on the rise, films like The Promise may soon become gambles that make even the most spendthrift of financiers think twice. \u2018The Promise\u2019: Watch a trailer: Watch trailers , movies and more on Yahoo View , available now on iOS and Android .

Security Council sanctions. \nThe Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the North\u2019s ruling Workers\u2019 Party, did not mince its words. \n\u201cIn the case of our super-mighty preemptive strike being launched, it will completely and immediately wipe out not only U.S. imperialists\u2019 invasion forces in South Korea and its surrounding areas but the U.S. mainland and reduce them to ashes,\u201d it said. KCNA KCNA / Reuters Military vehicles carry missiles during a military parade marking the 105th birth anniversary of country's founding father Kim Il Sung, \nReclusive North Korea regularly threatens to destroy Japan, South Korea and the United States and has shown no let-up in its belligerence after a failed missile test on Sunday, a day after putting on a huge display of missiles at a parade in Pyongyang. \n\u201cWe\u2019re reviewing all the status of North Korea, both in terms of state sponsorship of terrorism as well as the other ways in which we can bring pressure on the regime in Pyongyang to re-engage with us, but re-engage with us on a different footing than past talks have been held,\u201d Tillerson told reporters in Washington on Wednesday. \nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence, on a tour of Asian allies, has said repeatedly an \u201cera of strategic patience\u201d with North Korea is over. \nU.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said during a visit to London the military option must be part of the pressure brought to bear. \n\u201cAllowing this dictator to have that kind of power is not something that civilized nations can allow to happen,\u201d he said in reference to Kim. \nRyan said he was encouraged by the results of efforts to work with China to reduce tension, but that it was unacceptable North Korea might be able to strike allies with nuclear weapons. \nNorth and South Korea are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. \n\u2018MAX THUNDER\u2019 \nSouth Korea\u2019s acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, at a meeting with top officials on Thursday, repeatedly called for the military and security ministries to maintain vigilance. \nThe defense ministry said U.S. and South Korean air forces were conducting an annual training exercise, codenamed Max Thunder, until April 28. North Korea routinely labels such exercises preparations for invasion. \n\u201cWe are conducting a practical and more intensive exercise than ever,\u201d South Korean pilot Lieutenant Colonel Lee Bum-chul told reporters. \u201cThrough this exercise, I am sure we can deter war and remove our enemy\u2019s intention to provoke us.\u201d \nSouth Korean presidential candidates clashed on Wednesday night in a debate over the planned deployment in South Korea of a U.S.-supplied Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system, which has angered China. \nFrontrunner Moon Jae-in was criticized for leaving his options open before the May 9 election. \nOn Monday, Hwang and Pence reaffirmed their plans to go ahead with the THAAD, but the decision will be up to the next South Korean president. For its part, China says the system\u2019s powerful radar is a threat to its security. \nThe North has said it has developed a missile that can strike the mainland United States, but officials and experts believe it is some time away from mastering the necessary technology, including miniaturizing a nuclear warhead. RUSSIA, U.S. AT ODDS \nThe United States and Russia clashed at the United Nations on Wednesday over a U.S.-drafted Security Council statement to condemn North Korea\u2019s latest failed ballistic missile test. \nDiplomats said China had agreed to the statement. \nSuch statements by the 15-member council have to be agreed by consensus. \nPrevious statements denouncing missile launches \u201cwelcomed efforts by council members, as well as other states, to facilitate a peaceful and comprehensive solution through dialog.\u201d The latest draft statement dropped \u201cthrough dialog\u201d and Russia requested it be included again. \n\u201cWhen we requested to restore the agreed language that was of political importance and expressed commitment to continue to work on the draft ... the U.S. delegation without providing any explanations canceled the work on the draft,\u201d the Russian U.N. mission said in a statement. \nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China believed in the Security Council maintaining unity. \n\u201cSpeaking with one voice is extremely important to the Security Council appropriately responding to the relevant issue on the peninsula,\u201d he told reporters. \nThere has been some confusion over the whereabouts of a U.S. aircraft carrier group after Trump said last week he had sent an \u201carmada\u201d as a warning to North Korea, even as the ships were still far from Korean waters. \nThe U.S. military\u2019s Pacific Command explained that the USS Carl Vinson strike group first had to complete a shorter-than-planned period of training with Australia. It was now heading for the Western Pacific as ordered, it said. \nChina\u2019s influential Global Times newspaper, which is published by the People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party\u2019s official paper, wondered whether the misdirection was deliberate. \n\u201cThe truth seems to be that the U.S. military and president jointly created fake news and it is without doubt a rare scandal in U.S. history, which will be bound to cripple Trump\u2019s and U.S. dignity,\u201d it said.

(Representative image) \nSpooks obsessed with books are scaring the ghosts out of students in southern Assam\u2019s Cachar district. \nThe administrative bodies of 3 schools, located in the same compound, have engaged a team of maulvis to exorcise ghosts that apparently fancy flipping books and haunting students. These schools are Swadhin Bazar High School, Abid Raza Middle English School, and Swadhin Bazar LP School \u2013 all catering to local Muslim children. \nThe school authorities had on April 11 noticed \u201cunseen forces\u201d shifting stationery items and browsing through books. They also saw mass hysteria gripping the students, many of them girls. \n\u201cThe students would suddenly start shouting before falling unconscious one after the other. Panic slowly set in among the children and they stopped coming. Their parents are preventing them from coming to the schools,\u201d the headmaster of one the schools, who did not want to be named, said. \nSchool authorities held a meeting with some of the parents and they agreed to seek the services of some ghost-busting clerics. \nMaulana Mufti Afazuddin Laskar, claiming to be an exorcist, said the students recovered after he sprinkled water with \u201chealing powers\u201d on them. \n\u201cI went to the schools on Monday and saw some students lying unconscious on the benches. They could not say what made them behave strangely, but we think they were possessed by ghosts,\u201d Laskar, also an assistant teacher of Swadhin Bazar Islamia Madrasa, said. \nThe students, he added, did not remember anything after the miracle water he used helped them recover. \n\u201cWe performed Milad (Islamic ritual) on the compound. As a result, there was no eerie incident today (Tuesday),\u201d Laskar said. \nIqbal Hussain Barbhuiya, president of the schools\u2019 management committee, said 90% of the 1,000 students of the 3 schools turned up on Tuesday despite the exorcism. \n\u201cWhat happened in the past few days was inexplicable. We understand they are too scared to come after such strange incidents. But we are worried that most of the parents are not convinced that the schools are no longer haunted and want to take their children elsewhere,\u201d Barbhuiya said. \nHe said he has sought the help of the district administration to hold a meeting with the parents on Wednesday. tags ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-19T21:52:08.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2b89acaca971cc8cec26e5e399b8185010d426db", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nmFR93hfFGTKsyFq_MOLWqB1xA67I7WtcXdGYjGWW9MQiIWIoGwgQVSQL3nyU5PWSS0JSkWKozS9KoZWGgNM3oSaKys9NLNO1OCIsdMKD38A-", "site_full": "www.theguardian.com", "site": "theguardian.com", "site_section": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/19/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The Guardian", "title": "Violence feared as protesters clash at Venezuela 'mother of all marches' | World news", "title_full": "Violence feared as protesters clash at Venezuela 'mother of all marches' | World news | The Guardian", "published": "2017-04-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a776f15c2b41e1f8e975aac3e1d622437ea3c356/0_0_2646_1588/master/2646.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft&amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&amp;s=9275d64eeb44649aeb28e528a645e4e5", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 170, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 966, "comments": 0, "shares": 966}, "gplus": {"shares": 3}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2b89acaca971cc8cec26e5e399b8185010d426db", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nmFR93hfFGTKsyFq_MOLWqB1xA67I7WtcXdGYjGWW9MQiIWIoGwgQVSQL3nyU5PWSS0JSkWKozS9KoZWGgNM3oSaKys9NLNO1OCIsdMKD38A-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Virginia L\u00f3pez", "published": "2017-04-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Violence feared as protesters clash at Venezuela 'mother of all marches' | World news", "text": "At least three people have been killed and dozens injured in Venezuela as street battles erupted alongside a mass anti-government demonstration that the opposition billed as \u201c the mother of all marches \u201d.\nA 17-year-old boy was fatally shot in the head in a neighbourhood of Caracas, while several hours later a woman was killed in gunfire during a rally in the Andean state of Tachira near the Colombian border.\nAt least one legislator had to be hospitalised, and images posted online showed opposition leader and former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles choking on teargas. \nVenezuela on the brink: a journey through a country in crisis Read more \nAs night fell, a few thousand people were still gathered in a plaza in wealthy eastern Caracas as residents in nearby buildings banged pots and pans in a show of support. A group of youths with their faces covered tore down street signs and billboards for makeshift barricades.

Photograph: GUTIERREZ/EPA/REX/Shutterstock \nFears of bloodshed had been stoked after President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro put troops on the streets, supplied guns to sympathetic civil militias and called for a simultaneous rally of his supporters against what he said was a United States-backed coup.\n\nWednesday\u2019s deaths brought the total number of deaths at protests this month to seven. \n\nThe first victim on Wednesday, Carlos Moreno, was not taking part in the demonstration but was shot when government supporters approached an opposition gathering and opened fire, witnesses told Reuters. Moreno, who was three days from his 18th birthday, was shot in the head, and later died in the hospital.\n\nHours later, university student Paola Ram\u00edrez died in the opposition stronghold of San Crist\u00f3bal , after she and her boyfriend, were shot at by a group of men as they left a protest. \n\u201cWe were on a motorbike and they were following us, shooting,\u201d her boyfriend told Reuters. \u201cI left her on a block where she was going to find her sister and I went to hide the bike.

The chant \u201c Esta es la ruta para salir del hijueputa \u201d (\u201cThis is the way to oust the son of a bitch\u201d) echoed repeatedly around the downtown district.\n\nThe protesters came from all walks of life. Some said they had previously supported the government under Maduro\u2019s predecessor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez , but the worsening economic and social crisis had made them march for change. \n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Demonstrators build a barricade while clashing with riot police during the so-called \u2018mother of all marches\u2019 in Caracas, Venezuela, on Wednesday.

The government has also tried to reduce the size of protests by cutting subway services and setting up highway roadblocks.\n\nFor seasoned observers of Venezuelan politics, this may sound familiar. In the 18 years since the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, and his successor Maduro assumed power, Venezuelans have grown accustomed to giant rallies for and against the government. \nSeveral have turned violent, but none have spurred significant change. Although the opposition seized control of Congress in the 2015 election, they are divided and have failed to galvanise popular discontent. \n\n'We are like a bomb': food riots show Venezuela crisis has gone beyond politics Read more \nBut there are differences from the past. The economy is deteriorating, with the IMF predicting this week that Venezuelan unemployment will surpass 25% this year as the country suffers a third year of recession. There is also less regional support for Maduro following the rightward shift of governments in Argentina and Brazil. \nThe mood is becoming more confrontational. \n\nWhereas in previous marches people wore white shirts and baseball caps with Venezuela\u2019s tricolor flag, this time protesters on the frontline hid their identity behind masks and hoodies. Banners and flags have given way to slingshots and rocks. \nEven Maduro was recently pelted with objects in the eastern city of San F\u00e9lix, traditionally a bastion of government support.\n\nOn Wednesday, the president addressed a red-shirted crowd of supporters in Caracas, saying that a \u201ccorrupt and interventionist right wing\u201d had been defeated. \nSocialist Venezuela chipped in $500,000 to Trump's inauguration Read more \n\u201cToday the people stood by Maduro!\u201d the president said, who claimed that more than 30 \u201cterrorists\u201d had been arrested. \u201cWe\u2019ve triumphed again! Here we are, governing, governing, governing with the people!\u201d he added, before breaking into song. \nShortages of food, medicine and other basics have eroded support for the government in poor neighbourhoods.

By Tom James 1.3k \nApril 18 (Reuters) - An asteroid more than a quarter mile (400 meters) wide will pass close to Earth on Wednesday, zooming by at a distance of just over a million miles (1.8 million km), but with no chance of impact, according to NASA scientists. \nSmaller asteroids routinely make closer passes to Earth, but 2014 J025, discovered in May 2014, will be the largest asteroid to come this near to the planet since 2004, flying by at only about 4.6 times the distance from the Earth to the Moon, 1.1 million miles (1.8 million km). \n\u201cWe know the time that the object is going to be closest within seconds, and the distance is known within hundreds of kilometers (miles),\u201d Davide Farnocchia, a mathematician at NASA\u2019s Near-Earth Object program, said by telephone on Tuesday. \nHaving several years of data on the asteroid\u2019s trajectory gives scientists the ability to predict its path very confidently, he added. \nThe asteroid, estimated to be between one-quarter and three-quarters of a mile (600-1,400 meters) wide and twice as reflective as the Moon, won\u2019t be visible to the naked eye, but sky watchers should be able to view it with home telescopes for one or two nights starting on Wednesday. \nThe approach of J025 will be the asteroid\u2019s closest for at least the next 500 years. \nIn 2004, the 3.1-mile (5-km) wide asteroid Toutatis passed about four lunar distances, or just under a million miles (1.6 million km) from Earth. \nAmateur astronomers may be watching J025\u2019s journey, but Farnocchia said he and his colleagues have moved on to tracking even closer encounters, such as asteroid 1999 AN10, a half-mile (800-meter) wide rock predicted to pass only 236,000 miles (380,000 km) from Earth, or slightly less than the distance to the Moon, in 2027.

And she\u2019s sung them again and again.\n\u201cPeople say all I do is repeat myself,\u201d she said in a recent phone conversation. \u201cBut I have certain ideas that fascinate me.\u201d\nFor nearly 40 years, Ms. Gal\u00e1s, 61, has bared those ideas \u2014 society\u2019s indifference to the sick, sexual violence, genocide, mental illness, incarceration, loneliness \u2014 with a voice that stretches from hostile growls to bitter-cold shrieks.\nShe rose to prominence in the 1980s as a kind of avant-garde angel of the AIDS epidemic. Joining the activists of Act Up, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, she created a series of rancorous indictments of the political, medical and religious establishment \u2014 hissing, rasping, wailing evening-length performances with titles like \u201cPlague Mass\u201d and \u201cMasque of the Red Death.\u201d\nIn 1985, Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times that Ms. Gal\u00e1s \u201csuggests an entranced Medusa, conjuring avenging spirits out of the darkness.\u201d As her work has taken in collaborations with John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin, explorations of sensory deprivation and a book of her texts with a title both unprintable and blasphemous, that description has remained remarkably, consistently on point. It holds true in her two most recent albums, released simultaneously last month: \u201cAll the Way,\u201d a gloomy compilation of jazz covers and standards, and \u201cAt Saint Thomas the Apostle Harlem,\u201d which captures a 2016 New York performance of what she has called \u201cdeath songs.\u201d\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story At first she was resistant to the idea of revisiting eight central tracks from a career spent both stubbornly fixated and constantly looking forward. \u201cOnce it\u2019s recorded, it\u2019s gone,\u201d she said. \u201cMy mind fills up with new ideas. Life is short.\u201d But in the end, she required little prompting to talk about her music and its meanings.\n\u2018The Litanies of Satan\u2019 from \u2018The Litanies of Satan\u2019 (1982) Growing up with a musician father, Ms. Gal\u00e1s played the piano in bands, but eventually longed to be a frontwoman. \u201cI want to just go into a dark room where no one can hear me,\u201d she recalled, \u201cand use my voice to express whatever I\u2019m thinking and feeling in that moment, uncensored by the demands of music \u2014 jazz, classical, anything.\u201d\nHer first album, recorded in a chilly basement in England, was an explosion of screeches and moans. But the title, she insists, had nothing to do with devil worship: \u201cThe work is not a paean to Satan. It\u2019s about a prince of exile, it\u2019s someone who\u2019s been cast from society. The idea of someone being completely cast from society and surviving, and somehow managing to make it through every wretched day.\u201d\nPhoto Ms. Gal\u00e1s performing \u201cDefixiones, Orders From the Dead\u201d in New York in 2005. Credit Richard Termine for The New York Times \u2018Let My People Go\u2019 from \u2018Plague Mass\u2019 (1991) \u201cThe Litanies of Satan\u201d was made just before the AIDS epidemic, which claimed Ms. Gal\u00e1s\u2019s brother and dominated years of her work. She became involved in Act Up and wrote \u201cMasque of the Red Death,\u201d a ferocious attack on the lack of concern about the disease and its victims, which premiered at Lincoln Center in 1989.\nIn \u201cPlague Mass,\u201d recorded live during performances at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York in 1990, she repurposed her sepulchral, severe version of this spiritual as the closing number. It was already a Gal\u00e1s signature, a highlight of her previous album, which also had a Satan-tinged title: \u201cBy that time, 1988, \u2018You Must Be Certain of the Devil,\u2019 there was no metaphor any more,\u201d she said. \u201cThat album was an AIDS album.\u201d\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story \u2018Vena Cava 5\u2019 from \u2018Vena Cava\u2019 (1993) \u201cAnd after that,\u201d she said, \u201cwas \u2018Vena Cava,\u2019 about the concatenation of AIDS dementia and clinical depression and that they were often inseparable. Or couldn\u2019t be told apart by doctors or people who visited. And combined into terrifying mental states.\u201d\nWith faint sounds audible in the background, Ms. Gal\u00e1s\u2019s voice is sometimes choked and hyperventilating, sometimes whispery and obsessive. \u201cNursie, nursie,\u201d she repeats at one point, and later the numbers \u201c6-7-8,\u201d over and over.\n\u2018Dark End of the Street\u2019 from \u2018The Sporting Life\u2019 (1994) Her collaboration with Mr. Jones, a longtime admirer, took the form of a raucous album of songs fantasizing about taking sadistic vengeance on wayward men. This cover of a 1960s soul classic is from a favored Gal\u00e1s genre: desperate love ballads.\n\u201cIt\u2019s another one of those songs,\u201d she said, \u201cwhere you go to the wrong place. Where you know the ending\u2019s going to be bad, so what the hell.\u201d\n\u2018Smell\u2019 from \u2018Shrei X\u2019 (1996) \u201c\u2018Shrei\u2019 is a torture piece about a person with no possibility of escape,\u201d said Ms. Gal\u00e1s, who has performed it in the dark, in quadraphonic sound. The sonic landscape is spare and creepy; her voice, serrated and throaty. (It sounds, it must be said, a little like Gollum.) Finally, she hisses: \u201cIt\u2019s the smell of death.\u201d\nPhoto Ms. Gal\u00e1s in 1998.

B. King\u2019s livelier hit version.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story On \u201cAll the Way,\u201d she said, she was drawn to love songs \u2014 \u201cthese pernicious songs,\u201d she called them \u2014 that, like \u201cThe Dark End of the Street,\u201d are less celebratory than masochistic. \u201c\u2018All the Way\u2019 is not an optimistic anthem,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018All the Way\u2019 means all or nothing. And also \u2018You Don\u2019t Know What Love Is\u2019: These are almost suicidal anthems. They\u2019re the willingness to go to a dangerous place again.\u201d\n\u2018O Death\u2019 from \u2018At Saint Thomas the Apostle Harlem\u2019 (2017) Her vocalism is no less extreme on these two new albums, but there\u2019s often a more low-slung, more relaxed quality about them, particularly in this leisurely yet taut take on the old folk song: churning piano, a coppery howl, an eerie, baby-like babble.\n\u201c\u2018O Death\u2019 is a love song as well,\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018O Death\u2019 is saying how sweet your body begins to smell to me as your organs begin to shut down, you who are becoming old, old, old.

Alexander Cornwell Bloomberg via Getty Images 680 \nEmirates Airlines , the largest international airline by passenger traffic, said on Wednesday it was cutting flights on five U.S. routes after restrictions imposed by President Donald Trump \u2019s administration on some air travel had weakened demand. \nSince taking office, Trump has twice signed executive orders banning refugees and citizens from some Muslim-majority countries from visiting the United States. Although both moves were blocked by U.S. judges , some travelers have been deterred . \nThe U.S. administration also introduced new security measures in March banning electronic devices larger than a mobile phone from being taking into aircraft cabins on direct flights to the United States from several Middle East locations. \n\u201cThe recent actions taken by the U.S. government relating to the issuance of entry visas, heightened security vetting and restrictions on electronic devices in aircraft cabins have had a direct impact on consumer interest and demand for air travel into the U.S.,\u201d an Emirates spokeswoman said. \nDetailing changes to flight schedules, she said: \u201cThis is a commercial decision in response to weakened travel demand to the U.S.\u201d \nDirect flights to Fort Lauderdale and Orlando would drop to five a week in May from daily flights, while Seattle and Boston flights would be reduced to a daily service in June from two flights a day, the statement said. \nTwice daily Los Angeles flights would also be reduced in July to one a day, it added. \n(Reporting by Alexander Cornwell; Editing by Edmund Blair) ALSO ON HUFFPOST Families Reunited After Travel Ban Lifted Families Reunited After Travel Ban Lifted 1 of 12 Mustafa Aidid, right, a Somali national who was delayed entry into the U.S. because of the Jan. 27 travel ban, is reunited with his brother Taha Aidid, left, at Washington Dulles International Airport in Chantilly, Virginia on Feb. 6, 2017.

The rotating floor has safety mechanisms in place that caused it to immediately shut off; restaurant staffers and patrons scrambled to free the boy , who was then rushed to the hospital. But sadly, Charlie succumbed to his head injuries and was pronounced dead later that day.\nAccording to police reports, Charlie had only wandered a few feet from his parents, who were seated at a table near the window, when he became stuck. \"I simply think he lost sight of his parents and panicked, and found himself in that situation. A small child doesn't know what to do in those moments,\" Warren Pickard, a spokesman for the Atlanta Police Department, told reporters. Officials have ruled his death an accident.\n\"The family asks for prayers and privacy right now to come to terms with this tragedy,\" a spokesperson for the Holt family said in a statement released to WBTV . \"No words can express their loss. If you have a loved one, please give them an extra hug today.\"\nAccording to Scary Mommy , some internet commenters were quick to blame Charlie's parents for the tragedy. The article highlighted a few of the judgmental comments that appeared on Huffington Post's Facebook page in response to the incident:\nRestaurants aren't playgrounds, they are places for dining. I've seen so many loose kids nearly trip the wait staff. If they can't sit down and enjoy a meal at a restaurant, then they're not ready to eat at a restaurant.\nSo sorry for this little boy. I see it all the time, parents allowing little children to run free. It's not your home. Supervision of your children is expected. Tears for this little lost soul because of neglect.\nThis is a good reason to not let your bratty kids run wild in a restaurant. Especially dumb ones that manage to get themselves wedged in between the wall\u2026\n\"The fact that anyone's first instinct is to vilify a pair of grieving parents who lost their son in a grisly accident really speaks to the state of modern society,\" wrote Scary Mommy's Valerie Williams. \"Let's just hope that those who dare to judge and blame are always perfect and never on the other side of something so completely, unimaginably awful.\"\nAs the mother of a 21-month-old boy myself, my heart aches for Charlie's parents-but I can also completely understand the instinct to want to blame them. Why? When I spot devastating stories like this one in my Facebook newsfeed, I instinctively try to convince myself that something like this could never happen to me (even though I know that's not true-it could happen to any parent, even the most vigilant among us), because otherwise, I'd have to fully digest the fact that I live in a world where my husband and I might take our son out to lunch, and he could wind up dead. But the reality is that this was a freak accident-and Charlie's parents don't deserve to be dragged through the mud of the internet in the aftermath.\nSo let's all heed the Holt family's suggestion, and give our loved ones some extra big hugs today.\nYou Might Also Like\n30 Thumbprint Cookie Recipes Perfect for the Holidays 40+ Non-Traditional Christmas Dinner Ideas You Need to Try This Year 15 Great Gift Ideas for Teachers", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "warren pickard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlie holt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "holt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "valerie williams", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "wbtv", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta police department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta journal constitution", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huffington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "westin peachtree plaza hotel", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "charlotte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-19T01:02:44.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "737f36da4a187b05d203a4e8a2c18685412864c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ4kcwEST15E2K4a3McpAlnb1bfJgEv42TmC3ntElufTZzkUfVnhzGxDJURTL4vkW4bHhWTY6m81g--", "site_full": "www.ft.com", "site": "ft.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Subscribe to read", "title_full": "Subscribe to read", "published": "2017-04-19T05:54:03.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.216, "main_image": "", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 1571, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 962, "comments": 0, "shares": 962}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 21}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "737f36da4a187b05d203a4e8a2c18685412864c2", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ4kcwEST15E2K4a3McpAlnb1bfJgEv42TmC3ntElufTZzkUfVnhzGxDJURTL4vkW4bHhWTY6m81g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-04-19T05:54:03.000+03:00", "title": "Subscribe to read", "text": "More from the FT Group Markets data delayed by at least 15 minutes. \u00a9 THE FINANCIAL TIMES LTD 2017.

The headline in the Daily Mail, the newspaper that now wears the mantle of the voice of Theresa May with a flamboyant confidence, was reassuring to anyone who might have wondered if they\u2019d overegged their reaction to the election announcement. Yep, that\u2019s right, she really doesn\u2019t think opposition is acceptable.\nBut for the Mail, there\u2019s more to it than that. The saboteurs are not just messing with the Brexit agenda, nor even the popular will. They are jeopardising the promise of a nostalgia-rich future of the kind inhabited by Jonathan Waterer , a Devon farmer who shuns tractors in favour of shire horses. Pages two and three of today\u2019s Mail are devoted to a double-page spread of the majestic sight of five shires ploughing abreast. Not great for grain yields, maybe, but fantastic to look at, and without the common agriculture policy there won\u2019t be any Eurocrats telling him he\u2019s breaking the rules.\nMay is really asking for what was once called a doctor\u2019s mandate. That is, the power to do whatever it takes.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Sun, to which she gave an \u201cexclusive chat\u201d , she was quite explicit about the need to stop MPs \u201csubverting the will of the people\u201d. The front page hinted at the fury that might be unleashed \u2013 a poll to \u201ckill off\u201d Labour, \u201csmash rebel Tories\u201d and commit \u201cBlue murder\u201d \u2013 if she was thwarted by elected representatives doing the job for which they are paid.\nOf course, May is not to blame for the way her actions are interpreted. But there is something chilling about the way she is ready to ride in their slipstream.\nOn Radio 4\u2019s Today programme this morning she couldn\u2019t muster a single persuasive argument for her rash and startling U-turn. She could only repeat that despite having lost not a single vote on the article 50 legislation in the Commons, she needs a bigger majority.\nAs so often before, the prime minister is playing a very canny game which is only lightly disguised by her vicar\u2019s daughter reputation for plain dealing. She does not need to explain that she will use her sustained poll lead to weaken Labour, maybe taking 50 or more seats from them and giving herself a 100+ majority. She must hope that Brexit troublemakers on the backbenches will be so dazzled by the prospect that they won\u2019t notice that such a big majority would rob them of most of their power. That\u2019s assuming that the new intake aren\u2019t even more rabidly enthusiastic for galleon Britain than the existing ones.\nIt doesn\u2019t take much of a thought experiment to see how useful it will be for her not to have to face any significant threat in the Commons during the period of negotiations, and by delaying the next election until 2022, to have shifted the election time table two years back in her favour. For those of us who want the softest possible Brexit, this is probably good news.\nBut the language she \u2013 and her amplifiers in the media \u2013 is using is calculated to deliver exactly the opposite message. What she is really doing is asking for what was once called a doctor\u2019s mandate. That is, the power to do whatever it takes. It\u2019s politically convenient, but its relationship to the central democratic idea of accountability is remote.\nThat makes the pusillanimous capitulation of MPs in the Commons on the Fixed-Term Parliament Act, before a single speech has been made, all the more pathetic.\nAnyone with a vote in the Commons today who has read the intimidatory messages in this morning\u2019s headlines, and is still prepared to go ahead and let her have her election, should be sent to remedial civics classes at once. They need to stop and think about what this means for parliamentary democracy.\nLike the proverbial turkeys, MPs seem set on conspiring in their own emasculation. For if this election goes as expected, it will mean the creation of something that looks like an elective dictatorship. Even if it ends in five years\u2019 time, it will have eroded the habits and conventions of parliamentary opposition.\nThe Guardian view on the 2017 general election: a poll that Britain does not need | Editorial Read more \nEach headline suggesting that the prime minister\u2019s critics are saboteurs who are overdue a re-education session hoeing cabbages in the Fens, undermines popular faith in the process of democracy, just as surely as labelling judges \u201cenemies of the people\u201d whittles away at faith in the processes of the law.\nThe more that the Commons behaves as if elections were simply a measure to be gamed, the way the prime minister is now, the more excluded voters will feel. No one\u2019s self esteem is raised by being treated as a number; no one feels better for being conned by the deceitful sleights of hand that are the stuff of daily political life.\nTheresa May\u2019s strategy is transparent. There is no need for this election . So stand up and resist. Britain is not run by plebiscite, it is a parliamentary democracy.

Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire.REUTERS/Brian Snyder)\nBernie Sanders appeared in an ad supporting Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election, according to the new book \" Shattered : Inside Hillary Clinton's Doomed Campaign ,\" but he could not bring himself to say the words \"I'm With Her\" in it. Authors Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes reveal in the book that Hillary's team gave Sanders a script for the ad in September.\nThe script included Clinton's famous slogan, \"I'm With Her. Upon seeing the ad and slogan, Sanders said \"It's so phony!,\" according to a report on the exchange from The Hill .\nSanders added that he didn't \"want to say that.\"\nAccording to the book, Bernie still shot the ad without the slogan and did multiple takes addressing different angles such as eliminating support for Libertarian Gary Johnson, but the finished product did not sit well with focus groups and was ultimately cut. Undecided voters were unconvinced of Sanders' support for Clinton in the ad after their bitter fight the Democratic primaries.\nThe book cites one Clinton aide as saying \"People didn't feel that it was an authentic pitch for her and what she wanted to do. It even had some backlash in folks saying that he's not really supporting her.\"\nSanders endorsed Hillary in July last year, and spoke at a rally for her in Raleigh, North Carolina , in early November when her campaign was suffering due to the lingering effects of an FBI investigation into her use of a private email server.\nNOW WATCH: 'This bill is a shame and a disgrace': Watch John Lewis' fiery speech opposing the GOP health care bill\nMore From Business Insider\nHillary Clinton reportedly blamed everyone but herself for her humiliating defeat to Trump\nNew book says Hillary Clinton went through her campaign staffers' emails to figure out why she lost the 2008 primaries\nTRUMP: FBI Director James Comey was 'very, very good to Hillary Clinton,' and she would be 'going to trial' if he weren't", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-comey-clinton-bartiromo-interview-2017-4", "http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/329224-sanders-on-im-with-her-its-so-phony&quot;", "http://www.businessinsider.com/fbi-emails-clinton-weiner-laptop-2016-10", "http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-blame-for-election-loss-to-trump-2017-4", "http://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-raleigh-north-carolina-hillary-clinton-pharrell-2016-11", "http://www.businessinsider.com/bernie-sanders-raleigh-north-carolina-hillary-clinton-pharrell-2016-11&quot;", "http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/329224-sanders-on-im-with-her-its-so-phony", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0553447084", "http://www.businessinsider.com/watch-john-lewis-fiery-speech-opposing-gop-health-care-bill-house-of-representatives-2017-3", "http://www.businessinsider.com/watch-john-lewis-fiery-speech-opposing-gop-health-care-bill-house-of-representatives-2017-3&quot;", "http://www.businessinsider.com/hillary-clinton-campaign-staffer-emails-2008-2017-4", "http://www.businessinsider.com/fbi-emails-clinton-weiner-laptop-2016-10&quot;"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "bernie sanders", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "brian snyder", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "amie parnes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gary johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john lewis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james comey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan allen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new hampshire.reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raleigh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the hill", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-19T20:01:07.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "8b63f5c406c296a32153f847909e3d031dfbcb56", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOg8LZVy5G_GgNsLSfGuv9lfEt066o..evlS7EI._Lxamjba9tAzpgFrhcT8_OJw.t2b4KJy_aIdPg--", "site_full": "www.huffingtonpost.com", "site": "huffingtonpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/feeds/verticals/black-voices/index.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Black Voices -

There were endless references to being thrown in the oven, being gassed.\u201d \nSome messages were directed to Gersh\u2019s employers, urging them to fire her for \u201cfor her unprofessional, illegal, and anti-white conduct\u201d, according to the complaint. Others were directed to her 12-year-old son\u2019s Twitter account, where one message read: \u201cPsst kid, theres a free Xbox One inside this oven.\u201d \nImages posted online included photographs of Tanya, her son, and other Jewish residents Photoshopped over an image of a concentration camp. \n\u201cThere was one night I came home, and my husband was sitting in a completely dark house and had suitcases in our room and he said he had no idea what kind of danger we were in,\u201d Gersh told reporters, her voice breaking with emotion. \u201cWe thought we should probably wake the kids in the middle of the night and run for safety.\u201d \nShe said she struggled with what to tell her two boys, incredulous that she and her husband might have to tell their children that \u201cwe\u2019re running the middle of the night because we\u2019re Jewish\u201d.\n\u201cThis was so far beyond harassment. This was really terrorism,\u201d she said. \nAccording to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), at least three far-right murderers have been readers of Anglin\u2019s neo-Nazi website: Dylann Roof, who massacred nine people at a historic African American church in Charleston ; Thomas Mair, who murdered the British MP Jo Cox ; and James Jackson, who was charged with murdering a randomly chosen black man in New York City with a large knife in March. \nSince the troll attack, Gersh said, she has been unable to work as a realtor, worried that \u201cI can\u2019t expose my clients to potential harassment\u201d. She sees a trauma therapist twice a week, is crippled by anxiety, and often falls asleep and wakes up weeping, she said. \nAnglin\u2019s antisemitic march, originally set for Martin Luther King Day in January, never happened. Instead, townspeople handed out cups of matzo ball soup on a street corner, and counter-protesters, including a group of anti-fascists from a local university, wandered through mostly empty streets. \n\n  Downtown Whitefish on Martin Luther King Day was decorated with messages of love. Photograph: Lois Beckett for the Guardian \nBut the damage to Gersh and her family was lasting, she said. The lawsuit, filed by the SPLC on Tuesday, asks for unspecified damages \u201cfor invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and violations of Montana\u2019s Anti-Intimidation Act\u201d.\n\u201cIn the old days, Anglin would have burned a cross on Tanya\u2019s lawn to intimidate her,\u201d the SPLC president, Richard Cohen, said. By suing Anglin and attempting to win a \u201clarge damage award\u201d, Cohen said, the group hoped to make it riskier to carry out coordinated, anonymous online attacks. \nWhile the SPLC has filed many lawsuits against hate group leaders, this was the first time the group had done it in \u201ca digital context\u201d, Cohen said. \nAnglin did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\nCohen said he expected Anglin to raise \u201cfirst amendment issues\u201d in his defense. \nThe lawsuit against Anglin is the latest turn in a bizarre and sometimes terrifying series of events that followed the small Montana town\u2019s attempt to repudiate a local far-right extremist. \nIt also puts a spotlight on the relationship between Spencer and Anglin, an online troll who has said he is trying to radicalize American teenage boys with a website crammed with a constantly updating stream of Holocaust jokes, racist screeds and opportunities to attack the site\u2019s enemies as part of online harassment campaigns. \nAnglin has told the Guardian that media attacks against him and his website only make him stronger, by driving increased attention and traffic to his site, which the SPLC called \u201cthe most popular English-language website of the radical right\u201d.\nSpencer rose to prominence last year as the face of the Trump-supporting \u201calt-right\u201d, a fractured group of far-right populists, racists, antisemites and misogynists. He became infamous for shouting \u201cHail Trump! Hail Victory!\u201d at a white nationalist conference after Trump\u2019s election, which several supporters greeted with the Nazi salute, a sequence of events that Spencer later said were \u201cclearly done in a spirit of irony\u201d. \nHow leftwing media focus on far-right groups is helping to normalize hate Read more \nAt Trump\u2019s inauguration in Washington, a masked protester punched Spencer in the face, a move that sparked a debate on the ethics of punching a Nazi. \nSpencer used to spend part of the year living with his mother in Whitefish, a picturesque ski town near Glacier National Park, and used the town as a backdrop last year for several media interviews about his white nationalist views.\nWorried that Whitefish\u2019s association with Spencer would tarnish the town\u2019s reputation, which is largely dependent on tourism, some local leaders and advocates pushed through an official condemnation of Spencer\u2019s views in December. On Facebook, some local residents had discussed going further and staging some kind of protest of a building that Spencer\u2019s mother owned in town.\nIn a local television news report in December and later in a long online post under her name, Spencer\u2019s mother, Sherry Spencer, claimed that she was being punished for her son\u2019s political views. The online post said Gersh, a local realtor, talked to Sherry Spencer about potential protests at her building and suggested that she sell it and donate the proceeds to a local human rights group while denouncing her son. Sherry Spencer said these were \u201cterrible threats\u201d and said that Gersh and local human rights groups \u201cappeared to seek financial benefit from threats of protests and reputation damage\u201d.\n\u201cIn what moral universe is it right for the \u2018sins\u2019 of the son to be visited upon the mother?\u201d she wrote. \nThe SPLC\u2019s complaint says Sherry Spencer originally called Gersh for help, asked her advice on what to do about the potential protests, and then asked Gersh to be the realtor to sell the building. Later, according to the complaint, Spencer got \u201ccold feet\u201d and said she wanted to proceed with the sale independently. Gersh agreed. Spencer gave her no notice before posting a public attack online, a \u201ctwisted\u201d version of their interactions, the complaint alleges, suggesting that the post was actually written by Richard Spencer, not his mother. \nIn late January, the FBI told the Guardian it was reviewing the incident between the two women but had not determined whether it would open an official investigation.\nIn mid-December, a local news story about the spat was picked up by online trolls, including Anglin, who featured the story on his site the Daily Stormer as an outrageous example of \u201charassment and extortion\u201d, and urged his supporters to \u201ctake action\u201d.\n\u201cAre y\u2019all ready for an old fashioned Troll Storm?\u201d he asked. \n\u201cNO VIOLENCE OR THREATS OF VIOLENCE OR ANYTHING EVEN CLOSE TO THAT,\u201d Anglin wrote. \u201c Just make your opinions known. Tell them you are sickened by their Jew agenda.\u201d \nThe post included phone numbers, e-mail addresses, addresses and social media handles for Gersh, her husband, her young son, and the founders of a local anti-Nazi human rights group. \nTopics Montana Internet Cyberbullying FBI Bullying Social media  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-19T01:09:18.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "12f58da9272254e45286ad87a8360fff08062fae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nIlGLQMub.V2.KfNvj6F4.9bVcS.gWzMV7Vw2CYlRXO26Mq7TpR688FCfkdbo0omIEqC5RDBT8V.dOx3B6iKai6elrnxtxWsDYsWEAne5la4-", "site_full": "www.theguardian.com", "site": "theguardian.com", "site_section": "http://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The Guardian", "title": "Bill O'Reilly's Fox News career hangs in balance as company calls board meeting | Media", "title_full": "Bill O'Reilly's Fox News career hangs in balance as company calls board meeting | Media | The Guardian", "published": "2017-04-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b21fad1b781ad89a99497085bd78f5f67636cf3b/0_168_2992_1796/master/2992.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft&amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&amp;s=c85f2a6fe1a658ba37b08a2462c437db", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 170, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 959, "comments": 0, "shares": 972}, "gplus": {"shares": 13}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "12f58da9272254e45286ad87a8360fff08062fae", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nIlGLQMub.V2.KfNvj6F4.9bVcS.gWzMV7Vw2CYlRXO26Mq7TpR688FCfkdbo0omIEqC5RDBT8V.dOx3B6iKai6elrnxtxWsDYsWEAne5la4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Dominic Rushe", "published": "2017-04-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Bill O'Reilly's Fox News career hangs in balance as company calls board meeting | Media", "text": "Fox News star Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s 21-year career at the news network ended on Wednesday amid allegations of sexual harassment and an advertising boycott.\n\u201cAfter a thorough and careful review of the allegations, the company and Bill O\u2019Reilly have agreed that Bill O\u2019Reilly will not be returning to the Fox News Channel,\u201d a spokesman for 21st Century Fox , Fox News\u2019s parent company, said in a statement.\nIn a statement, O\u2019Reilly called the allegations \u201ccompletely unfounded\u201d.\n\u201cOver the past 20 years at Fox News, I have been extremely proud to launch and lead one of the most successful news programs in history, which has consistently informed and entertained millions of Americans and significantly contributed to building Fox into the dominant news network in television,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt is tremendously disheartening that we part ways due to completely unfounded claims. But that is the unfortunate reality many of us in the public eye must live with today.\u201d\nCritics charged the company had been forced to act amid \u201cindustrial-scale harassment\u201d at the company and that the problems extended beyond O\u2019Reilly.\nO\u2019Reilly, host of Fox News\u2019s biggest show, The O\u2019Reilly Factor, is currently on vacation and had said he would return to work on Monday. But the future of the man dubbed \u201cthe king of cable news\u201d became increasingly insecure after an internal investigation following a New York Times story that revealed Fox and O\u2019Reilly had paid $13m in settlements to five women who accused the host of sexual harassment. \nThe Times\u2019 story and subsequent allegations of impropriety sparked protests and a boycott from 50 advertisers , including car manufacturers Hyundai, BMW, Mitsubishi, insurer Allstate and drugmakers Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline.\nAn average of four million viewers watched O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show each night during the first three months of the year, a record for cable news. His attacks on liberals and \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d set the tone for the network and his huge audience drew top advertisers. But as the allegations mounted against him in recent weeks, pressure has grown for Fox to act. \nOn Tuesday, another former Fox News employee called a 21st Century Fox hotline to report allegations of sexual and racial harassment against O\u2019Reilly, according to her lawyer.\nThe board of Fox News\u2019s parent company, 21st Century Fox, was scheduled to meet on Thursday to discuss the matter further. The Fox News chairman, Rupert Murdoch, had reportedly backed O\u2019Reilly while Murdoch\u2019s sons James and Lachlan were said to favor O\u2019Reilly\u2019s removal. Donald Trump had also come to O\u2019Reilly\u2019s defense saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think Bill did anything wrong.\u201d\nOn Tuesday a lawyer for O\u2019Reilly, Marc E Kasowitz of Kasowitz Benson Torres, said his client was the subject of a harassment campaign coordinated by liberal pressure groups. \u201cBill O\u2019Reilly has been subjected to a brutal campaign of character assassination that is unprecedented in post-McCarthyist America,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThis law firm has uncovered evidence that the smear campaign is being orchestrated by far-left organizations bent on destroying O\u2019Reilly for political and financial reasons. That evidence will be put forth shortly, and it is irrefutable.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s departure is the second sex scandal to rock the network in less than a year. Last July, Fox News\u2019s then chairman, Roger Ailes, was forced out amid allegations that he sexually harassed numerous women . Those allegations led to the departure of another of Fox\u2019s primetime stars, Megyn Kelly, who also accused Ailes of inappropriate behavior. \nBoth O\u2019Reilly and Ailes have vehemently denied the allegations against them. O\u2019Reilly said he paid the settlements in order to \u201cput to rest any controversies to spare my children\u201d.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wendy Walsh details allegations against Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly \nLosing O\u2019Reilly will be a major blow for Fox News. His pugnacious show dominates the primetime cable news landscape, and his show\u2019s ratings have spiked in the wake of the scandal as loyal viewers have tuned in to give their support. O\u2019Reilly, 67, has been an anchor at the network since he started in 1996. He earns an estimated $18m a year, and Fox extended his contract just after the New York Times broke its story on the initial allegations.\nThe woman making the latest allegations, who has said she wants to remain anonymous and is not seeking payment, reported that in 2008, O\u2019Reilly would stop by her desk and grunt like a \u201cwild boar\u201d. The woman, who is African American, said O\u2019Reilly called her \u201chot chocolate\u201d, according to her lawyer, Lisa Bloom.\nAngelo Carusone, the president of media watchdog Media Matters who also ran the @ StopOReilly Twitter account, said Fox News had been forced to act. \u201cThey had years to address serial sexual harassment at Fox News. They didn\u2019t; they actually enabled it. So, individuals and groups took action to educate advertisers,\u201d he said.\n\u201cAdvertisers fled because they immediately recognized what Fox News has ignored for over a decade: that serial sexual harassment is not only wrong, but bad for business,\u201d he said. \u201cFox News deserves no accolades, only scorn for the industrial-scale harassment they have forced their employees to endure.\u201d\nCarusone said: \u201cThe open question is what Fox News will do about the epidemic of sexual harassment at Fox News that extends well beyond O\u2019Reilly.\u201d\nO\u2019Reilly, on vacation in Italy, met briefly with Pope Francis on Friday in St Peter\u2019s Square.

Livia Gershon Huffington Post Exclusive History of Advertising Trust/Heritage Images/Getty Images This ad, circa 1880-1900, describes a \" soothing syrup \" for teething children made from morphine and alcohol. 320 \nDoctors prescribing painkillers willy-nilly. Outrage over foreigners importing \u201cpoison\u201d into America. Expensive treatment facilities marketed to addicts from well-off families. These are things America has seen before, when the country went through its first opioid crisis. \n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a parallel between our historical moment and the 1860s,\u201d said Susan Zieger, author of Inventing the Addict , a history of addiction in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. \nIn the late 1860s, doctors were battling to get the public to respect them as scientifically oriented professionals, distinct from traditional healers. With the invention of hypodermic morphine, they gained a powerful weapon in this battle. \nBut the drug created a generation of patients who struggled with dependence, leading to attitudes about drug use, treatment, and \u201cworthy\u201d and \u201cunworthy\u201d addicts that remain with us today. \nOpium pods had long been a staple of folk medicine , brewed in teas or used in tinctures to treat a huge variety of troubles, from infants\u2019 colic to tuberculosis. By the 1860s, medical journals touted morphine, a distilled form of opium\u2019s active ingredient, as a miracle drug. It launched a big business, and more potent painkillers soon followed. Victorians Had Their Own \u2018Big Pharma\u2019 \nWe can lay a lot of the blame for the current opioid epidemic on the pharmaceutical industry, which has long promoted the heavy use of opioids to treat pain. In the 1990s, doctors increasingly relied on opioid prescriptions to treat chronic pain as a separate problem from any underlying diseases. \nIn the 19th century, doctors made less of a distinction between a disease and its symptoms. \u201cAny change that could be effected in a patient\u2019s symptoms was seen as acting on the disease; the more effect a treatment had on a patient, the better,\u201d writes anthropologist Marcus Aurin . Science & Society Picture Library via Getty Images An 1850s etching by George Sala showing George and the Dragon and a man carrying a tray loaded with bottles of arsenic, opium and morphine. \nAt the time, doctors needed to set themselves apart from \u201chomeopaths, regular physicians, natural bone-setters, local wise ones, and so on,\u201d the late medical historian David F. Musto wrote. Medicine that could successfully treat pain gave them that competitive advantage. \nThat\u2019s why morphine, combined with the hypodermic syringe, was such an important innovation: It was a far more potent way to treat pain. Injected morphine came to be widely adopted in the 1860s and was promoted in medical journals as a \u201cmiracle of biomedical science,\u201d according to Aurin. \nDescribing hypodermic morphine in 1868, Dr. Francis Anstie, editor of the British medical journal The Practitioner, wrote that \u201cof danger, there is absolutely none ... The advantages of the hypodermic injection of morphia over its administration by the mouth are immense ... the majority of the unpleasant symptoms which opiates can produce are entirely absent ... it is certainly the fact that there is far less tendency with hypodermic than with gastric medication to rapid and large increase of the dose.\u201d \nIn 1898, Bayer began promoting an even more potent injected painkiller \u2015 heroin \u2015 a name meant to suggest a \u201cheroic\u201d treatment. Rich Addicts Are Sick, Poor Addicts Are Criminals \nMany observers have noted how today\u2019s middle-class, white opioid addicts are generally treated as victims of a disease, while poorer black and Latino drug users are more likely to be considered criminals. \nThe notion of addiction as an illness was a middle-class thing from the start. When doctors first started using the term \u201caddiction\u201d in the late 1860s, it was mainly to describe middle- to upper-class women who typically got hooked on morphine their doctors prescribed. Through the last decades of the 19th century, many physicians set up profitable sanatoriums and addiction clinics to treat these patients. \nBut by the turn of the century, doctors began to recognize the dangers of handing out morphine syringes to every patient with menstrual cramps or a cough. Fewer well-to-do addicts were being created, and many of those receiving treatment either got well or died off. The Cosmopolitan A vintage ad for addiction treatments in Cosmopolitan. Through the last decades of the 19th century, many physicians set up profitable sanatoriums and addiction clinics to treat patients hooked on prescription opioids. \n\u201cThe field of inebriety cure and treatment ceased to be a lucrative one, and doctors rapidly divested themselves of their interest in it,\u201d Aurin writes . \u201cAddiction remained a curable disease only so long as there were patients willing and able to pay for treatment.\u201d \nAs the number of upper- and middle-class addicts declined, the public face of addiction became the working-class urban man. By the early 20th century, cheap, widely available heroin was the drug of choice for this demographic. \nHeroin was essentially the same drug as morphine, but doctors associated it with working-class people and immigrants \u2015 and, therefore, with deviant personalities. \n\u201cThe heroin addict is of an inferior personality type compared with the morphanist,\u201d AMA President Dr. Alexander Lambert wrote in 1921. \u201cMorphine is the drug of the stronger personality.\u201d \nLambert added that, while heroin and cocaine caused \u201csocial and public health problems,\u201d morphine addicts \u201cshow no tendency to become a social menace.\u201d Racism Was Always Part Of The War On Drugs \nSpeaking at the Mexican border recently, Attorney General Jeff Sessions railed against criminals entering the country to \u201crape and kill innocent citizens\u201d and \u201cprofit by smuggling poison.\u201d \nLast year, Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) complained about \u201cguys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty\u201d who he claimed bring heroin into the state and \u201cimpregnate a young white girl before they leave.\u201d \nThe first government warnings about the dangers of drugs were also deeply entwined with racism. In 1909, Aurin writes, prominent doctor Hamilton Wright, working on behalf of the State Department to address the opium issue, complained that the country was \u201ccontaminated through the presence of a large Chinese population.\u201d \nBy the 1920s and \u201830s, Zieger said, popular fiction depicted a Chinese-American underworld in which white people risked becoming \u201censlaved\u201d by opium. \n\u201cIt was also obviously kind of a fear of white women being seduced by people of another race,\u201d she said. \nIn fact, this fear had come to San Francisco, a center of Chinese immigrant life, even before the turn of the century. Physician Winslow Anderson described the \u201csickening sight of young girls ... lying half-undressed on the floor or couches, smoking with their lovers.\u201d \nNot surprisingly, San Francisco became the first place in the country to pass anti-opium legislation in 1875. In the early 20th century, as xenophobia spread and heroin and opium use became increasingly associated with the poor, the federal government passed new anti-drug laws. \nThe epidemic caused by Victorian-era prescribing patterns was over, replaced by Americans\u2019 modern beliefs about drugs \u2015 which are deeply tied to racial and class stereotypes. \nZieger said the war on drugs that began in the Nixon era continues to appeal to some of the same racist and classist attitudes that drove the first wave of criminalization. \n\u201cThey play to a certain type of right-wing, middle-class desire to punish whoever they can punish,\u201d she said. \nToday, that view of drug use as a blameworthy, criminal habit of the \u201clower classes\u201d is again vying with the concept of addiction as a disease for which the medical community bears some responsibility. \nThe question, this time, is whether we can extend a more compassionate view of addiction beyond the white middle class. \nThis reporting is brought to you by HuffPost\u2019s health and science platform, The Scope.

Livia Gershon Huffington Post Exclusive History of Advertising Trust/Heritage Images/Getty Images This ad, circa 1880-1900, describes a \" soothing syrup \" for teething children made from morphine and alcohol. 320 \nDoctors prescribing painkillers willy-nilly. Outrage over foreigners importing \u201cpoison\u201d into America. Expensive treatment facilities marketed to addicts from well-off families. These are things America has seen before, when the country went through its first opioid crisis. \n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a parallel between our historical moment and the 1860s,\u201d said Susan Zieger, author of Inventing the Addict , a history of addiction in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. \nIn the late 1860s, doctors were battling to get the public to respect them as scientifically oriented professionals, distinct from traditional healers. With the invention of hypodermic morphine, they gained a powerful weapon in this battle. \nBut the drug created a generation of patients who struggled with dependence, leading to attitudes about drug use, treatment, and \u201cworthy\u201d and \u201cunworthy\u201d addicts that remain with us today. \nOpium pods had long been a staple of folk medicine , brewed in teas or used in tinctures to treat a huge variety of troubles, from infants\u2019 colic to tuberculosis. By the 1860s, medical journals touted morphine, a distilled form of opium\u2019s active ingredient, as a miracle drug. It launched a big business, and more potent painkillers soon followed. Victorians Had Their Own \u2018Big Pharma\u2019 \nWe can lay a lot of the blame for the current opioid epidemic on the pharmaceutical industry, which has long promoted the heavy use of opioids to treat pain. In the 1990s, doctors increasingly relied on opioid prescriptions to treat chronic pain as a separate problem from any underlying diseases. \nIn the 19th century, doctors made less of a distinction between a disease and its symptoms. \u201cAny change that could be effected in a patient\u2019s symptoms was seen as acting on the disease; the more effect a treatment had on a patient, the better,\u201d writes anthropologist Marcus Aurin . Science & Society Picture Library via Getty Images An 1850s etching by George Sala showing George and the Dragon and a man carrying a tray loaded with bottles of arsenic, opium and morphine. \nAt the time, doctors needed to set themselves apart from \u201chomeopaths, regular physicians, natural bone-setters, local wise ones, and so on,\u201d the late medical historian David F. Musto wrote. Medicine that could successfully treat pain gave them that competitive advantage. \nThat\u2019s why morphine, combined with the hypodermic syringe, was such an important innovation: It was a far more potent way to treat pain. Injected morphine came to be widely adopted in the 1860s and was promoted in medical journals as a \u201cmiracle of biomedical science,\u201d according to Aurin. \nDescribing hypodermic morphine in 1868, Dr. Francis Anstie, editor of the British medical journal The Practitioner, wrote that \u201cof danger, there is absolutely none ... The advantages of the hypodermic injection of morphia over its administration by the mouth are immense ... the majority of the unpleasant symptoms which opiates can produce are entirely absent ... it is certainly the fact that there is far less tendency with hypodermic than with gastric medication to rapid and large increase of the dose.\u201d \nIn 1898, Bayer began promoting an even more potent injected painkiller \u2015 heroin \u2015 a name meant to suggest a \u201cheroic\u201d treatment. Rich Addicts Are Sick, Poor Addicts Are Criminals \nMany observers have noted how today\u2019s middle-class, white opioid addicts are generally treated as victims of a disease, while poorer black and Latino drug users are more likely to be considered criminals. \nThe notion of addiction as an illness was a middle-class thing from the start. When doctors first started using the term \u201caddiction\u201d in the late 1860s, it was mainly to describe middle- to upper-class women who typically got hooked on morphine their doctors prescribed. Through the last decades of the 19th century, many physicians set up profitable sanatoriums and addiction clinics to treat these patients. \nBut by the turn of the century, doctors began to recognize the dangers of handing out morphine syringes to every patient with menstrual cramps or a cough. Fewer well-to-do addicts were being created, and many of those receiving treatment either got well or died off. The Cosmopolitan A vintage ad for addiction treatments in Cosmopolitan. Through the last decades of the 19th century, many physicians set up profitable sanatoriums and addiction clinics to treat patients hooked on prescription opioids. \n\u201cThe field of inebriety cure and treatment ceased to be a lucrative one, and doctors rapidly divested themselves of their interest in it,\u201d Aurin writes . \u201cAddiction remained a curable disease only so long as there were patients willing and able to pay for treatment.\u201d \nAs the number of upper- and middle-class addicts declined, the public face of addiction became the working-class urban man. By the early 20th century, cheap, widely available heroin was the drug of choice for this demographic. \nHeroin was essentially the same drug as morphine, but doctors associated it with working-class people and immigrants \u2015 and, therefore, with deviant personalities. \n\u201cThe heroin addict is of an inferior personality type compared with the morphanist,\u201d AMA President Dr. Alexander Lambert wrote in 1921. \u201cMorphine is the drug of the stronger personality.\u201d \nLambert added that, while heroin and cocaine caused \u201csocial and public health problems,\u201d morphine addicts \u201cshow no tendency to become a social menace.\u201d Racism Was Always Part Of The War On Drugs \nSpeaking at the Mexican border recently, Attorney General Jeff Sessions railed against criminals entering the country to \u201crape and kill innocent citizens\u201d and \u201cprofit by smuggling poison.\u201d \nLast year, Maine Gov. Paul LePage (R) complained about \u201cguys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty\u201d who he claimed bring heroin into the state and \u201cimpregnate a young white girl before they leave.\u201d \nThe first government warnings about the dangers of drugs were also deeply entwined with racism. In 1909, Aurin writes, prominent doctor Hamilton Wright, working on behalf of the State Department to address the opium issue, complained that the country was \u201ccontaminated through the presence of a large Chinese population.\u201d \nBy the 1920s and \u201830s, Zieger said, popular fiction depicted a Chinese-American underworld in which white people risked becoming \u201censlaved\u201d by opium. \n\u201cIt was also obviously kind of a fear of white women being seduced by people of another race,\u201d she said. \nIn fact, this fear had come to San Francisco, a center of Chinese immigrant life, even before the turn of the century. Physician Winslow Anderson described the \u201csickening sight of young girls ... lying half-undressed on the floor or couches, smoking with their lovers.\u201d \nNot surprisingly, San Francisco became the first place in the country to pass anti-opium legislation in 1875. In the early 20th century, as xenophobia spread and heroin and opium use became increasingly associated with the poor, the federal government passed new anti-drug laws. \nThe epidemic caused by Victorian-era prescribing patterns was over, replaced by Americans\u2019 modern beliefs about drugs \u2015 which are deeply tied to racial and class stereotypes. \nZieger said the war on drugs that began in the Nixon era continues to appeal to some of the same racist and classist attitudes that drove the first wave of criminalization. \n\u201cThey play to a certain type of right-wing, middle-class desire to punish whoever they can punish,\u201d she said. \nToday, that view of drug use as a blameworthy, criminal habit of the \u201clower classes\u201d is again vying with the concept of addiction as a disease for which the medical community bears some responsibility. \nThe question, this time, is whether we can extend a more compassionate view of addiction beyond the white middle class. \nThis reporting is brought to you by HuffPost\u2019s health and science platform, The Scope.

Credit: YOUTUBE The Southern Poverty Law Center announced it is filing a federal lawsuit against Andrew Anglin, the founder of the Daily Stormer, a neo-nazi website, for the harassment of Tanya Gersh in Whitefish, Montana last year. Tanya Gersh, who is Jewish, is one of many people Anglin encouraged his readers to harass. Last December, Anglin urged white supremacists to \u201ctroll\u201d people they considered to be Jewish in Whitefish, Montana, falsely claiming that they were \u201ctargeting\u201d Sherry Spencer, the mother of white supremacist Richard Spencer. Gersh said she has received hundreds of threatening emails, text messages, and voicemails, many of them referencing the Holocaust. There are at least 14 posts tagged with her name on the Daily Stormer website. \u201cI once answered the phone and all I heard were gunshots. One time I answered the phone and heard, \u2018You really should have died in the Holocaust with the rest of your people\u2019\u2026 This was so far beyond harassment. This was really terrorism,\u201d Gersh said on a press call on Tuesday. \u201cMy sense of safety is forever changed.\u201d Gersh recalled a night when she came home to her husband sitting in a \u201ccompletely dark house with suitcases in our room\u201d and he said to her, \u201cWe have no idea what kind of danger we\u2019re in.\u201d \u201cI think I broke when they directed attacks at my kids,\u201d Gersh said. In his Daily Stormer post, Anglin cited a Daily Mail article in which Sherry Spencer said her son\u2019s \u201cextreme positions\u201d are hurting her business. Spencer owns a commercial building and she was considering selling it. The Daily Mail piece does not go into any great detail as to how exactly residents of the town are causing her financial distress by disagreeing with her son. Sherry Spencer accused Love Lives Here, a peace organization, of having something to do with harming her financially, but the Daily Mail provides no proof of this, and the organization told the Mail it \u201c\u2018did not know what she (was) talking about.\u2019\u201d Gersh\u2019s remarks to her local television station were placed in the Mail article. During the press call, Richard Cohen, president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said residents of Whitefish were considering a protest of Sherry Spence\u2019s commercial building due to a belief that she was supporting white nationalist activities through the rent she received. Sherry Spencer reached out to Gersh to \u201chelp her sell the building and distance herself from her son\u2019s activities,\u201d but had a \u201cchange of heart.\u201d Although Anglin\u2019s article never mentions anyone\u2019s religion, he claimed that Jewish people, who he described as a \u201cvicious, evil race of hate-filled psychopaths,\u201d were harassing Sherry Spencer and called for a \u201ctroll storm.\u201d Anglin published social media accounts, photos, phone numbers, and email address of members of Love Lives Here, which he called a \u201cterrorist group.\u201d Anglin also encouraged the harassment of a local real estate owner and her family and published their photos and addresses. The post read: \u201cAre y\u2019all ready for an old fashioned Troll Storm? Because AYO\u200a\u2014\u200ait\u2019s that time, fam. And as always: NO VIOLENCE OR THREATS OF VIOLENCE OR ANYTHING EVEN CLOSE TO THAT . Just make your opinions known. Tell them you are sickened by their Jew agenda to attack and harm the mother of someone whom they disagree with. Anglin has targeted Infowars host Alex Jones because he married a Jewish woman and called his campaign \u201cOperation: Jew Wife.\u201d He has promoted hashtags to fuel racist activity online, such as #WhiteGenocide and #RaceWarNow and has started various disinformation campaigns in an attempt to trick the media into reporting on them. He instructed readers to use Facebook to create fake \u2018White Student Union\u201d pages. Anglin has attempted to distance himself from violent acts committed by white supremacists. Anglin argued that the murder of Timothy Caughman, who was fatally stabbed in New York City by James Jackson, a man who belonged to a hate group, had \u201cnothing at all to do with the religion of White Supremacy.\u201d He claimed that white supremacists would \u201cbe subject to unfair scrutiny and prejudice\u201d due to the attack. Jackson, however, specifically mentioned the Daily Stormer when explaining his views on race to the press after he committed the murder. According to a 2015 New America study, in the years since the Sept. 11 attacks, nearly twice as many people were killed in the United States by white supremacists and anti-government radicals than by Muslim extremists. One of those white supremacists, Dylann Roof, who killed nine African Americans as they attended church, may have been a regular commenter on the Daily Stormer website. Statements from his manifesto were found almost verbatim in the comments of a user called AryanBlood1488.

According to a 2015 study by the Pew Research Center , the percentage of the American population that identifies as Christian dropped 7.8 percent between 2007 and 2014. And, while there was a 1.2percent increase in the number ofpeople who identify with non-Christian faiths in that same period, the percentage of Americans who don't identify with a religion rose 6.7 percent.\n\nBut what about when your faith is your livelihood? After years of study and seminary, after building an entire life around your faith, what do you do when you realize thelink between you and your higher power has disappeared?\nThe Clergy Project is an online support group that exists for former religious professionalswho have found a better fit for their spiritual selves withAtheism. Formed in 2011, the groupaims to help ex-clergy deal with the inevitable ethical andphilosophicalquestions that arise when leaving afaith, as well as help them adapt to life away from the spiritual world.\nWe spoke to several former clergy involved in The Clergy Project about how and why they abandoned their faith.\nShlomo Levin, former Rabbi As a rabbi, you are responsible for and called upon to answer questions. These questions range from the more profound, like, \"Rabbi, what happens after we die?\"to the very mundane, \"Rabbi, is this yogurt kosher?\"As I became older, I began to feel much less confident in my ability to know the answers to all of these questions. I found it very burdensome to have to have all the answers. People will ask after a funeral, \"Can this person still hear me?\" And I just have no idea. I couldn't say, \"I don't know.\" It really weighed on my conscious to give people answers that I knew could be hurtful to them. I think a lot of people find Orthodox Judaisma source of joy. I'm all for that, if that's what they want. But at times, it was clearly not. Some people were just made to suffer. \nI found it very liberating to not have belief. It's hard to live knowing that there's a God in the sky that will punish you if you don't do a certain ritual at a certain time in a certain way. It's a lot easier this way. I don't miss it at all. \nJohn Gibbs, former Methodist minister When I was in my 20s I had a personal crisis, kind of after a breakup. I had graduated from college but I just didn't really have any real direction. I just felt like I was drifting and that I didn't like how that felt. I started going back to church then, and it was pretty soon after that that I decided to do what people my whole life had been asking me to do, which was to follow in my father's footsteps. So I went to seminary. Then I fell into a faith crisis. I didn't get to the point where I could say I was an Atheist yet, though, but it was more just questioning the specifics of Christianity, like the divinity of Christ and the resurrection. I never really had a strong belief in those things to begin with, though. I began looking at Christianity as a myth, and not in a favorable sense. From then on, I really struggled with that question of: what am I doing here? I began to regularly ask myself how I could get out.\nSo, I spent a year or so preaching out of the Old Testament and working on how to wrap my head around Christianity's mythological perspective. When I decided to leave, my congregationwere relieved. They saw what I was going through, and it wasn't pretty. Some of them were glad to see me go, others were concerned for my well-being. But I think everyone felt like me being removed was for the best.\nI didn't know what to do with myself on Sundays besides go to church, so I didn't really leave the church... Then I realized that I had been looking for something that I repeatedly had not found.I know a lot of people think there's not enough community around. Religion isabout the community. It's about feeling validated.I've spent a lot of time thinking about how to bring some resources into the secular culture that I think are valuable. Like some warmth. Some basis for community to coalesce around.\nScott, former monk within the Self-Realization Fellowship I always thought there was something more deep to life, rather than just what the eye could see. I got really into eastern practices of religion when I was in college. I was at a party and a friend recommended The Autobiography of a Yogi [the autobiography of Self-Realization Fellowship founderParamahansa Yogananda]to me.I got hope from it, and frankly a lot of that was wishful thinking. I wanted there to be more than the eye could see. Once I joined, it was stifling in there. You weren't officially allowed to read other books or see other movies. We got to see movies once a month, and they were screened and censored. Same with the books. Self realization should be about just thatrealizing yourself. It's a frustrating feeling. That was what led me out. It wasn't really the \"God\" question, it was more, \"Why doesn't the system work?\" I wasn't feeling what I thought I should, and I was putting it back on myself. I would tell myself I wasn't practicing it right. But then I realized, no, I was just beating myself up. It's not me, it's the system.\n\nEJ Hill, founder of a Dutch-Reformed church in South Africa I was born into the Dutch Reformed Church of South Africa, but at the age of sixteen I had a \"supernatural experience\", or at least, that is how I interpreted it at the time. I was convinced that God revealed Himself to me, because I was chosen to fulfill a special purpose. For almost twentyone years I spent most of my free time in Bible study and Apologetics. Slowly, but surely, I started looking at the Bible more critically. I quickly discovered that the God of the Bible approved of many things that I simply could not approve of, namely forced abortion, slavery, misogyny, and deception by proxy to name but a few. I quickly realized that all I,and everyone else for that matter,wasdoing, was to confirm in our own minds that which we believed God approved of. The \"small still voice\"in our heads, were in fact ours, not God's. Losing my faith was one of the worst experiences of my life. My whole world fell apart. Lost many friends. Lost my wife. Lost my credibility.I had already left full-time ministry a few years earlier to pursue an independent Christian ministry. My online and offline followers were devastated. I received a lot of requests for clarification, hatemail, and criticism.\n\nI certainly do not hate the Church. I love people. Even those who disagree with me. Even those who dislike me.Despite their beliefs, churches do feed, clothe, comfort, and educate a large number of people. To simply discount that would be dishonest and short-sighted, to say the least.\nI do, however, think that they are wasting a lot of time, effort, and money on nonsense.\nDrew Bekius, former Baptist minister I was part of what's known as \"ceaseless prayer,\" which is the idea that you always have a constant conversation with God going on in the back of your mind at all times. During this time in my life, it turned to me begging and pleading with God to erase my doubt, to rebuild my faith. The Bible makes a lot of promises that you just have to humbly seek god and he will restore your faith. I'd say, \"Okay, I'm seeking you. So build it. I've been seeking it. Please help me. One more time, please, please help me. You promised to rebuild it. So rebuild it.\" I was constantly seeking and constantly confessing, continually crying out.\nWhen you're a regular person going to church, you might come across these questions and you say, of course, I'm just a regular person, this isn't my profession and I haven't studied it, so of course it doesn't make sense to me. But you also might think, but it makes sense to the guy up there preaching. But we're all up there, and we're like, well, it doesn't make sense to us either . It's kind of like Dorothy looking behind the curtain and seeing that this great, big flaming Oz is really just a guy pulling levers. That's what it's like for us too.

Australia's move to restrict migrant intake reflects broader global trend Read more \nThe changes come a day after Australia announced it would give priority to Australian workers by replacing the skilled 457 visa. Australia\u2019s prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said on Tuesday: \u201cAustralians must have priority for Australian jobs \u2013 so we\u2019re abolishing the [class] 457 visas, the visas that bring temporary foreign workers into our country.\u201d \nNew Zealand\u2019s immigration minister Michael Woodhouse used similar language in announcing the tougher criteria on Wednesday, saying: \u201cThe government has a Kiwis-first approach to immigration.\u201d \n\u201cIt\u2019s important that our immigration settings are attracting the right people, with the right skills, to help fill genuine skill shortages and contribute to our growing economy,\u201d he said.\u201cThat is why we are making a number of changes to our permanent and temporary immigration settings aimed at managing the number, and improving the quality, of migrants coming to New Zealand.\u201d \nThe changes include raising the income threshold to be classed as a skilled migrant to nearly NZ$50,000 (\u00a327,500) a year, classifying anyone earning NZ$73,000 and above as high-skilled and restricting work visas to low-skilled workers to three years, after which a mandatory stand-down period will be enforced before workers can re-apply. \nThe largest number of migrants to New Zealand come from Britain, China, India, the Philippines and South Africa. \nThe leader of the opposition, Labour leader Andrew Little, said the changes amounted to little more than \u201ctinkering\u201d by the government. \n\u201cNew Zealand is richer for immigration, but our public services, housing, and infrastructure can\u2019t keep up with the current record level of immigration,\u201d said Little in a statement. \n\u201cWe need to take a breather and catch up. We need to fix the immigration system to reduce the number of low-skill migrants coming into the country, while still bringing in the skilled workers we need. \n\u201c[The National party\u2019s] changes don\u2019t address the huge numbers of people coming here to do low-level qualifications or low-skill work, then using those visas as a stepping stone to residency.\u201d \nNew Zealand\u2019s general election is scheduled for September, with immigration and housing affordability set to be top of the agenda.

The issue itself is fiendishly complex , affecting a host of different interest groups who are already lobbying furiously . House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s framework for a bill is tremendously unpopular in the Senate . And the president himself has sent mixed signals, lately saying he wants to give health care another shot rather than moving on. This morning the New York Times\u2019 Alan Rappeport points out another serious problem \u2014 President Trump\u2019s refusal to release own his tax returns. As Rappeport writes, Democrats have lately been citing the lack of disclosure of the president\u2019s tax returns as a justification for opposing any GOP bill sight unseen. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t release his returns, it is going to make it much more difficult to get tax reform done.\u201d (As a reminder, Trump has claimed that he doesn\u2019t want to release his tax returns simply because he is under audit \u2014 a justification that makes no sense .) In part, this is a handy political talking point that\u2019s a convenient excuse for opposition, and a way to mobilize the liberal base, tens of thousands of whom marched at rallies last weekend calling for the returns\u2019 disclosure. It\u2019s also a bit of a win-win politically for Democrats \u2014 either Trump finally makes his tax returns public despite his clear reluctance to in an effort to kick-start the process, or Democrats hammer him for what he might be hiding. Still, this Democratic argument is most effective because of its substantive strength. Fundamentally, they are asking for more insight into how the president of the United States might benefit from sweeping tax code changes he hopes to sign into law. That seems like a very reasonable ask, and if Trump doesn\u2019t grant it, it will be easy for Democrats to characterize him as recalcitrant. So maybe he will give in out of his desire to finally get a legislative win. But maybe not: I did what was an almost an impossible thing to do for a Republican-easily won the Electoral College! Now Tax Returns are brought up again? \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 16, 2017 A wacky Supreme Court idea for President Trump Our daily politics news roundup will check in on several other big stories, so here\u2019s a look at what else is in the news. In others news, Chris Ruddy \u2014 a close friend of the president who founded the conservative website NewsMax and was last seen advocating for a major expansion of Medicaid \u2014 is now publicly floating some more idiosyncratic strategic advice. In an interview with Business Insider\u2019s Allan Smith , Ruddy said that Trump should try to replace Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg with \u2026 Barack Obama\u2019s failed nominee to the court, Merrick Garland. \u201cI think it would be a huge move and a sign for Trump that he's willing to break through the political ice,\u201d Ruddy said. It would indeed be a huge move \u2014 and one sure to provoke massive backlash from the socially conservative right, who would view Trump as betraying them on one of their most important issues. It\u2019s very questionable whether Mitch McConnell would betray his base by advancing such a nominee through the GOP-controlled Senate. Plus, the move wouldn\u2019t even earn Trump all that much goodwill from Democrats, who would cheerfully pocket this concession and likely go right on opposing him on other topics. So it\u2019s very difficult to imagine it happening. Still, it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that if a pro- Roe v. Wade justice does retire \u2014 whether that\u2019s Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, or Anthony Kennedy \u2014 Trump will be faced with a choice far more consequential than the Gorsuch nomination was. Because if Trump appoints another staunch conservative to one of those seats, then Roe , the decision preventing states from banning abortions, could well be overturned, with massive consequences for women nationwide. This would be the ultimate prize for social conservatives. But it\u2019s an outcome a city guy with at least some past track record of socially liberal views like Donald Trump is could well blanche at, and seek to avoid if he can. So it\u2019s worth noting that at least one trusted friend of his is counseling caution here. Today\u2019s top politics reads \u201c US military considers shooting down North Korea missile tests, sources say \u201d: \u201cThe US military is considering shooting down North Korean missile tests as a show of strength to Pyongyang, two sources briefed on the planning have told the Guardian. \u2026 Experts and former officials said shooting down a North Korean missile during a test would risk an escalation that Washington might not be able to control, which would risk potentially devastating consequences to allies South Korea and Japan.\u201d \u2014Spencer Ackerman and Justin McCurry, The Guardian \u201c Federal judge orders Kobach to share documents from his meeting with Trump \u201d: \u201cA federal magistrate judge has ordered Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach to disclose documents outlining a strategic plan he presented to then-President-elect Donald Trump in November, a decision that could have ramifications from Topeka to Washington. \u2026 The American Civil Liberties Union sought the documents\u2019 disclosure as part of an ongoing lawsuit over a Kansas law that requires voters to provide proof of citizenship, such as a birth certificate or passport, when they register to vote.\u201d \u2014Bryan Lowry, Kansas City Star \u201c Everything you need to know about the Georgia 6 Special Election \u201d \u201cIn the last nine polls taken, Ossoff is averaging 42 percent of the vote.

It was a terror like no other.\nFive promising filmmakers, most young and all hungry, were competing for a $1 million grant to make a feature that would have its premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival next year. The money came from AT&T, and the setup was very \u201cShark Tank\u201d: They would have 10 minutes to pitch their movie to a jury whose members included Lee Daniels , Jeffrey Wright and Anthony Mackie.\nThe idea was hatched earlier this year when Fiona Carter , AT&T\u2019s chief brand officer, asked Jane Rosenthal, the executive chair of Tribeca Enterprises, how to get more women and minorities making films.\nGiving someone $1 million, Ms. Rosenthal replied, would certainly help; most indie filmmakers have to scramble for a hodgepodge of funds and grants.\nSo Ms. Carter made it happen. The winning film will stream on AT&T platforms, including DirecTV Now, and the four runners-up will each pocket $10,000.\nStaffers at the festival and the Tribeca Film Institute sifted through hundreds of entries, looking for strong projects that were ready to go, and the final five were chosen.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story All the filmmakers had to do was win over Mr. Daniels and company.\n\u201cThere\u2019s no other grant like this in the country, if not the world, that gives a cool mil to a film,\u201d said Ani Simon-Kennedy , 29, who was pitching \u201cThe Short History of the Long Road,\u201d about a teenager living nomadically in a van. \u201cThere\u2019s so much on the line, and the jurors are mere feet away. You could sit on their laps.\u201d\nOn Monday each team arrived at the Tribeca Film Center to run their spiels by institute staff members and get tips (among them, \u201cRelay a sense of urgency\u201d). Next, they practiced on set, walking from backstage into a blaze of lights, and facing a stand-in jury. The reality-show feel of it left them all, to a one, unnerved.\nFaraday Okoro , whose film, \u201cNigerian Prince,\u201d explores the back stories of email scammers, fretted about his delivery. \u201cI\u2019m better one-on-one, or two-on-two,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s all in the prep.\u201d\nPhoto The filmmaker A.

District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro defended a practice that sometimes leads to sexual or domestic violence victims being incarcerated. \nIn the state of Louisiana, material witness warrants allow law enforcement to arrest the witness of a particular crime who is considered \u201cessential to the prosecution or the defense\u201d in order to coerce that victim into handing over information. In domestic violence and sexual assault cases, that \u201cwitness\u201d can also be the victim. \nThe law says that a witness to a crime \u201cshall be arrested and held in the parish jail, or such other suitable place as shall be designated by the court, until he gives an appearance bond as provided for defendants when admitted to bail, or until his testimony shall have been given in the cause or dispensed with.\u201d \nGovernment watchdog group Court Watch NOLA released a report condemning the practice on April 12, so Cannizzaro appeared on a local news report to defend this legislation under the guise of public safety. \n\u201cIf I have to put a victim of a crime in jail, for eight days, in order to [...] keep the rapist off of the street, for a period of years and to prevent him from raping or harming someone else, I\u2019m going to do that,\u201d Cannizzaro said on WWL\u2019s \u201cEyewitness Morning New.\u201d \nIn their report , Court Watch NOLA explained that there are a myriad of reasons survivors of physical and sexual violence may wish to stay out of court proceedings. \n\u201cThe victim may fear retribution from either the perpetrator of the crime or from others in the community,\u201d the report reads. \u201cAlternatively, the victim may not want to continue with the prosecution of the case because she or he is concerned with the consequences of continuing with the prosecution.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "jenavieve hatch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cannizzaro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leon cannizzaro", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "court watch nola", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wwl", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "la", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisiana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orleans", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-19T22:33:21.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f0d543c50933a2d80936db62efc6e3a9cb3248fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.lD3xDcHhkiL5MDQyEjBO7LQVWes0KRUqfCbqpXCcFzz9tvOd05YX4eLT2voAL8UATQNGVKSwbHydT4WbqI0I", "site_full": "fivethirtyeight.com", "site": "fivethirtyeight.com", "site_section": "http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/feed", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Features \u2013 FiveThirtyEight", "title": "How \u2018Qi\u2019 And \u2018Za\u2019 Changed Scrabble", "title_full": "How \u2018Qi\u2019 And \u2018Za\u2019 Changed Scrabble", "published": "2017-04-19T22:30:18.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/espn-fivethirtyeight/assets/images/open-graph-placeholder-culture.png", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 684, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 950, "comments": 0, "shares": 950}, "gplus": {"shares": 2}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f0d543c50933a2d80936db62efc6e3a9cb3248fa", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS.lD3xDcHhkiL5MDQyEjBO7LQVWes0KRUqfCbqpXCcFzz9tvOd05YX4eLT2voAL8UATQNGVKSwbHydT4WbqI0I", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Oliver Roeder (oliver.roeder@fivethirtyeight.com)", "published": "2017-04-19T22:30:18.000+03:00", "title": "How \u2018Qi\u2019 And \u2018Za\u2019 Changed Scrabble", "text": "Apr. 19, 2017 at 10:41 AM How \u2018Qi\u2019 And \u2018Za\u2019 Changed Scrabble Twitter \nI had a grand plan, dear reader. I planned to shed quantitative light on the problem of income inequality. And I planned to do it with a million games of web-scraped Scrabble tournament data. \nBut, like in Scrabble, where the best-laid plans sometimes leave you holding a rack full of vowels and nowhere to play them, I was left with unanswered questions and a pile of data. Turns out that Scrabble can\u2019t explain a core economic concept. But please bear with me. There\u2019s a data party favor at the end. \nInequality has skyrocketed in the U.S. over the past half-century, documented in great detail by all sorts of folks . One theory for the widening gap between the 1 percent and the 99 percent is technological change: When new technologies emerge, higher-skilled and higher-earning workers can more quickly adapt to and exploit them, the notion goes . They become more effective at work and can earn even more, and the gulf widens. \nThere has been dramatic \u201ctechnological\u201d change in Scrabble, too, and it involves dictionaries. Every weekend, in hotel ballrooms, empty offices and fast-food restaurants across the country, tournament Scrabble players take their seats, two to a board, to place the game\u2019s 100 lettered tiles. This is the Scrabble \u201ceconomy.\u201d Governing the interactions in this economy is a dictionary full of tens of thousands of allowed words. Every so often, the book gets even thicker \u2014 Scrabble\u2019s \u201ctechnology\u201d improves. \nAbout a decade ago, there was an actual technological revolution in the game: Its training tools went digital, allowing players to learn words and strategies more easily. In 2006, an early version of Zyzzyva , a now-indispensable word-study tool, was first publicized, and Quackle , a Scrabble analysis engine and A.I. sparring partner, was publicly released. \nThe biggest change happened that same year, in March, when a new dictionary, the second edition of the Official Tournament and Club Word List , took effect. This edition christened QI and ZA as valid Scrabble words in North American play, along with FE, KI, OI and an additional 11,000-odd longer words. Two-letter words are the building blocks of Scrabble\u2019s DNA, and the Q and Z are juicy high-point tiles \u2014 so the game evolved instantly. 1 You can see that in the data set I created by scraping over 1.5 million tournament games covering the years 1973 to 2017 from cross-tables.com, an online clearinghouse for Scrabble tournament results. After the new dictionary hit the scene, the average score grew by about 10 points per player per game overnight. (The average score in the data set is about 374.) 2 \nBut what other effects did this technical lexical revolution have? Did better players more effectively exploit these new words, increasing their average score more than their mediocre weekend counterparts? Did the Scrabble rich get Scrabble richer? Did income \u2014 ahem, point-scoring \u2014 inequality increase? \nI, and experts I spoke with, suspected yes. \u201cOne of the reasons I love Scrabble is the complex metagame \u2014 every time there\u2019s a new development, like a dictionary update, everyone has to adapt, and the game changes,\u201d Evans Clinchy, a top player from Oregon, told me. \u201cI definitely think that stronger players are better-equipped to exploit these changes than weaker ones.\u201d \nBut when I ran the numbers, trying to uncover inequality-exacerbating distributional effects of new words in the Scrabble economy, there was weak evidence at best. In fact, players of all skill levels seemed to benefit more or less equally from the expanded word lists, and average scoring went up similarly across the board. But maybe some light does shine through this Scrabble keyhole onto larger questions of macroeconomy. Thomas Piketty, a French economist and the author of \u201c Capital in the Twenty-First Century ,\u201d for example, is sharply skeptical of the technology explanation for income inequality, even if he probably didn\u2019t have Scrabble in mind. (By my count, the game isn\u2019t mentioned once in his book\u2019s 704 pages.) \nFiveThirtyEight believes in showing its work, which is why you read this piece of scratch paper and why we\u2019ve posted the data to GitHub .
