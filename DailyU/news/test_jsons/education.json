A Chinese team boarded the vessel early on Sunday. \nThe first hijacking by Somali pirates in five years occurred last month, but this is the second raid since then. \nA spokesman for UK Marine Trade Operations (UKMTO) in Dubai, who co-ordinate safe passage for merchant vessels in the Gulf of Aden, said all on board the hijacked ship were safe and heading to an unnamed destination under escort. \nThe UKMTO said the crew was from Syria, but a statement by India's ministry of defence said they were from the Philippines. \nMaritime piracy threatens to return \nReports in India said the hijacked ship was travelling between the ports of Kenang in Malaysia and Aden in Yemen. \nThe UKMTO said navy ships from India, China and Pakistan (the last operating as part of an international combined task force) changed course to approach the Tuvalu-flagged ship soon after the alert was raised. \nThe crew had locked themselves in the citadel, a safe room inside the ship designed to protect those on board from pirates. \nThe crew from the Chinese ship boarded the hijacked ship at dawn today, freeing those on board. India's military said it is believed the hijackers fled the ship during the night. \nPiracy in the waters off Somalia and Yemen peaked in 2011, with more than 200 attacks. \nBut after five years with no raids, an oil tanker was seized and held for ransom by Somali pirates in early March and there have been a number of attempted seizures since then.

No wonder everyone started calling it the cash-rich league. Rajasthan was crowned first IPL champions. 2009 X League Before Cricket: At three weeks notice, an event involving 59 matches, eight teams, 160-odd cricketers from across the world, 80 support staff and officials, was moved to another country, 7,860 km away. South Africa hosted the show and India got busy with the general elections. Deccan Chargers were crowned the champions in the season. 2010 X The Controversial One: More than the sport, this edition saw controversies surface. The biggest one was the Modi-Tharoor spat, which ended up with the then Minister of State Shashi Tharoor resigning from his post and the IPL commissioner Lalit Modi being sacked by the BCCI. Chennai tasted their first title win in the season. 2011 X The League Gets Bigger: Two more teams - Pune and Kochi were added this season making India's much-talked about League all the more exciting. Yuvraj Singh led Pune, while Mahela Jayawardene was the captain of Kochi. Ultimately, MS Dhoni-led Chennai emerged winners. 2012 X Rise Of New Champions: The season witnessed the termination of Kochi Tuskers Kerala from the tournament. The season was also blemished with a case of spot fixing after 5 players were allegedly caught on a sting operation carried on by a local news channel. Gautam Gambhir-led Kolkata defeated Chennai to become new champions. 2013 X The Spot-Fixing Saga: The sixth seaon was yet again marred with controversy after the demons of spot-fixing returned to the league. Three high-profile Rajasthan Royals' players were arrested in the infamous scandal raising questions on the credibility of the game. Despite the scandalous uprising, Mumbai Indians clinched their maiden title to give a befitting farewell to the retiring Sachin Tendulkar. 2014 X Kolkata's Dominance: Following the spot-fixing saga last season, the seventh edition of the IPL finally managed to do away with controversy. The cheerleaders were also removed as part of a plan to focus more on cricket. Yuvraj Singh created a stir after being bought for Rs 14 crore by Bangalore during the auctions. Kolkata defeated Punjab in the final to secure their second title in three years. 2015 X Mumbai reign supreme: After a poor start to the eighth edition, Mumbai Indians went won win their second title of the Indian Premier League, joining Chennai Super Kings and Kolkata Knight Riders as most successful teams in the tournament history. Mumbai had masters of cricket -- Ricky Ponting, Sachin Tendulkar and Anil Kumble -- in their coaching staff. They defeated CSK in the final. However, two major teams -- CSK and Rajasthan Royals -- suffered major blows when they were suspended for two editions for spot-fixing scandal after the tournament had ended. 2016 X 60 matches, 17963 runs and 652 wickets later we finally had a winner as Sunrisers Hyderabad clinched their maiden Indian Premier League title with an eight-run victory over Royal Challengers Bangalore at the M Chinnaswamy stadium. Season nine of the IPL was all about records being shattered. After a slow-start, the tournament really picked up and how. With a record 973 runs at an average of 81.08, RCB captain Virat Kohli finished as the highest scorer. Among the bowlers it was SRH pacer Bhuvneshwar Kumar, who took home the Purple Cap after bagging 23 wickets.

While the BJP warned Pakistan of tough reaction, the Congress urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to mount diplomatic pressure on Islamabad to secure his release. \n\nCongress' senior spokesperson P Chidambaram said the world knows that \"sham justice\" was meted out to Jadhav. \n\n\"We condemn what has happened in Pakistan and we hope that good sense will prevail and the death sentence imposed by this sham tribunal will not be carried out,\" he told reporters, with the fervent hope that Jadhav is still alive. \n\nChidambaram recalled a statement by Pakistan PM's adviser on foreign affairs Sartaz Aziz in December last year where he said that there is not enough evidence to proceed against Jadhav. \n\n\"Now from a statement which says that there is not enough evidence to legally proceed against Kulbhushan, to a death penalty given by a military tribunal whose jurisdiction to try an unarmed foreigner is seriously in doubt, is a huge leap,\" he said. \n\nNoting that the world knows this was a \"kangaroo trial\", if a trial took place at all, he said, \"the so-called justice meted out to Kulbhushan is sham justice\". \n\n\"The whole nation condemns Pakistan for going through this mock or kangaroo trial and inflicting the maximum penalty upon an admitted Indian citizen,\" he said. \n\nThe BJP also reacted strongly to the development and warned Pakistan to be ready for a strong response from India. \n\nBJP national spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain said Pakistan should be ready for a \"tough reaction\" from India if it executes Indian Navy former officer Kulbhushan Jadhav, given death penalty by its military court. \n\n\"Pakistan has no right to punish and give death sentence to Indian national Kulbhusan Jadhav. And if Pakistan goes ahead with this decision it should also get ready for a tough reaction from India,\" Hussain told reporters. \n\nPakistan will be condemned across the world if it hangs Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav, Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said. \n\n\"We leave their (Pakistan's) people. They are not able to come out of their old habits. It is very unfortunate. Whole world is watching what is happening and and it will attract worldwide condemnation,\" the information and broadcasting minister told reporters outside Parliament. \n\nHead of Congress communication department Randeep Singh Surjewala said, \"Death sentence is a deliberate provocation to India. BJP Government needs to travel beyond advisories. The PM must intervene to secure his release.\" \n\nHe said India needs to immediately mount an international diplomatic offensive to free Jadhav, who was given a death sentence by a Pakistani military tribunal for \"espionage and sabotage activities\" in restive Balochistan province and Karachi city. \n\nTo a question if this was failure on the part of the central government, Chidambaram said that it would be too strong a statement. \n\n\"I am sure they must have made efforts. I do not know. But if they have made efforts, I am sure they will tell Parliament what efforts they made. \"They should tell Parliament what efforts they made,\" he said, adding that his concern was that the maximum penalty imposed on the Indian should not be carried out. \n\nAttacking Pakistan for conducting a \"hurried\" trial of Jadhav without prior notice to India, Surjewala said the development was symptomatic of \"Pakistan's kangaroo court justice\". \n\nHe also cited media reports about Aziz's statement in his country's Senate that there was \"insufficient evidence against Jadhav\". \n\n\"Will PM pickup the phone & tell Pak about the falsehood of case against Kulbhushan Jadhav as admitted by Sartaj Aziz?

(Representational Image) \nThe railways have crossed a major hurdle in rolling out the ambitious bullet train project as the Maharashtra government has agreed to give land at the Bandra-Kurla complex (BKC). The starting point of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad high speed corridor at BKC was a bone of contention between the railways and the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) as the latter was strongly opposed to giving land to the public transporter. \nThe proposed bullet train will start underground from BKC and travel 21 km in a tunnel passing through the sea before emerging overground at Thane. \nThe MRDA had wanted to use the BKC land for the proposed International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) at BKC. The state Urban Development Department had also asked the railways to explore alternatives near Bandra Terminus and Kurla. \nHowever, the railways had rejected the suggestion and managed to convince the MMRDA that India\u2019s first high speed rail project should be constructed at an underground terminus at BKC, a senior Railway Ministry official said. \nSince the station is planned to be built underground, the above space can be utilised for IFSC construction, the official said. There are a total of 12 stations on the 508-km route \u2014 four of which are in Maharashtra and eight in Gujarat. \nA formal announcement is likely to be made by the railways and Maharashtra soon ending the uncertainities over location of the starting point of India\u2019s first bullet train project, the official said. \nThe total land available at BKC is about 67 acres and the project needs about 10 acre land. Passenger area, platforms, escalators, lifts among others will be constructed underground at BKC. \nEstimated to cost about Rs 97,636 crore, 81 per cent of the funding for the project will come by way of a loan from Japan. The project cost includes possible cost escalation, interest during construction and import duties. Maharashtra and Gujarat will also share 25 per cent cost each for the project. \nCurrently geo-technical survey is going on to be followed by the final location survey to mark the alignment and exact spots for the pillars on which trains will run at higher speed to reduce the travelling time between Mumbai and Ahmedabad drastically. \nIt takes about seven hours to travel between the two cities and the bullet train aims to reduce it to about two hours. Construction of the corridor is expected to start in 2018 and is estimated to be completed by 2023.

A customer of Punjab National Bank is the winner of third prize of Rs 25 lakh.All the three customers had done transactions using their RuPay debit cards. The names of three winners were not yet known as the draw only displayed their transaction numbers. These will be matched with card details to identify the winners.Three merchants also won prizes of Rs 50 lakh, Rs 25 lakh and Rs 12 lakh, respectively.The winners will be felicitated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 14 at Nagpur on the occasion of Ambedkar Jayanti.Following demonetisation of old Rs 500/1000 notes on November 9 last year, the government took a slew of measures to promote digital payments in the country.The government launched the Lucky Grahak Yojana for consumers and Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojana for merchants on December 25, 2016 to promote digital transactions. These schemes are being implemented by the National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI).In his address, Mukherjee asked citizens to extend their unstinted support to the mission of a less-cash India.\"India has a long way to go to become a cash less society. The initiatives of the government are a good beginning and we need to sustain and nurture these with active participation from all segments of the society.\"It is necessary to reduce cash in circulation and impart greater urgency to promoting secure digital payment methods to ensure greater transparency,\" the President said.Presently, India remain primarily a cash based economy with about 95 per cent of the personal consumption and 86 per cent of all transactions being in cash.\"All efforts of the government will achieve their end only if people were to adopt them proactively,\" he said, as he complemented the government on its \"bold initiatives\" for promoting the culture of digital payments.Stressing that India is on the cusp of a digital revolution, Mukherjee noted more than one billion Indians have a unique identity number with a biometric identifier which is unique in its own way.\"Even countries which are technologically far more advanced than India with comparatively much smaller size population do not have such a system in place. The Aadhaar card initiative is a watershed event in the development story of India,\" he said.Speaking on the occasion, Cabinet Secretary P K Sinha said, \"I would like reiterate our resolve and committement to take India towards digital economy.", "highlightTitle": "", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zC1.YsIxbbrrDEYEWH..WsoNf8apXCgLLu1Ejtwkk3R_JHh0r3q6X_izhJo0IF.0B9XYTAklsbH6YSmQxfM3VB7zjDSBbjXXEL43wGbcgUoqk_523ciJ_b39s5Nvk21R3_Ed0bhPysLCmJg_eKz0Tg4", "title": "Digital payments: Bank customer wins Rs 1 crore", "ord_in_thread": 0, "uuid": "4060f6b48d8c43d9d34c00e5d296ea472580960b", "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-09T16:36:06.348+03:00"}, {"highlightText": "", "author": "aljazeera.com", "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "rex tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sergei lavrov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bashar al-assad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "assad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boris johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucca", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "group of seven", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "thread": {"site_type": "news", "published": "2017-04-10T14:00:00.000+03:00", "performance_score": 9, "spam_score": 0.0, "uuid": "b7efbd99c218227de2dec21a2605e56dabf16875", "country": "QA", "replies_count": 0, "title": "Conflict in Syria set to dominate G7 discussions | News", "domain_rank": 2565, "site_categories": ["news", "education"], "main_image": "http://www.aljazeera.com/mritems/Images/2017/4/6/ac600797285b4d53a0f87527373ab71d_18.jpg", "participants_count": 1, "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 971, "likes": 971}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 4}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}}, "site": "aljazeera.com", "section_title": "Middle East News \u2013 the latest from Al Jazeera", "site_full": "www.aljazeera.com", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_9gF8SsUuiJIP655YJtTSR6r.8jql63g7ouDjil0AW7nb60XZX8xC1YzsqlfX1rMEmDiAuh3fxyYhC82VWahI2lO8WHXKWfazhvxZt5I7wQFmyNyUsm7t2yTciS8RTZCM-", "site_section": "http://www.aljazeera.com/topics/regions/middleeast.html", "title_full": "Conflict in Syria set to dominate G7 discussions | News | Al Jazeera"}, "external_links": [], "language": "english", "published": "2017-04-10T14:00:00.000+03:00", "text": "G7 foreign ministers were to send a \"clear and coordinated message\" to Russia over its stance on Syria as the US ratcheted up the pressure following a suspected chemical attack in the war-torn country.\nThe UK's Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson set the tone for the meeting, describing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad as \"toxic\" and saying it was \"time for (Russian President) Vladimir Putin to face the truth about the tyrant he is propping up\".\nUS strikes in Syria: Game changer or deterrent?

Former Palace undersecretary Halmen Valdez says officials in President Duterte's inner circle should not abuse their direct access to him \nMANILA, Philippines \u2013 Was President Rodrigo Duterte deliberately misinformed by his inner circle about the rice importation issue? \nDismissed Palace undersecretary Halmen Valdez thinks some officials with direct access to Duterte may have been \"name-dropping\" poor Filipino farmers in order to rile up the President. \"He reacts violently whenever he hears that the poor people are being oppressed. Unfortunately, some people close to the President or who get access to the President will make use of the sentiment of the President,\" said Valdez on Monday, April 10, during an interview with Rappler. \"It's public knowledge that his love for the poor is bordering on obsession. You name-drop the poor, you say the poor are being oppressed, maligned, 'yung mood niya, talagang gumugulo 'yung mundo niya (his mood, his world is plunged into chaos),\" said Valdez. She believes this is exactly what happened when some officials brought Duterte up to speed on the issue of rice importation. True enough, Duterte, during an event with farmers no less, announced he had fired Valdez because he perceived her to be pro-importation, and thus anti-Filipino farmer. Judging from his statements, he was told that importation should not be allowed because it is disadvantageous to local farmers, whose products cannot compete with the cheaper rice from abroad. Duterte professes to prioritize the interests of poor Filipinos over that of the \"oligarchs\" and \"elites.\" Who is pro-farmer? But Valdez said the \"poor card\" must have been used on Duterte to persuade him to fire her and to reject an extension of deadline for private rice importers. \"We should not abuse the poor card because it's a very important issue, it's a policy issue. It is a political commodity, yes, but rice with respect to the poor should be a policy-based approach,\" she said. When he spoke to farmers last Wednesday, Duterte said he fired Valdez because he did not know how to face farmers if he kept an official that supported importation. But the same official who denied the extension for rice importers, NFA Administrator Jason Aquino, is also pushing for rice importation but through government-to-government transaction. If Duterte were to prohibit any form of importation, there would be a shortage of rice because the local production of rice is not sufficient to meet the demand of consumers. Interestingly, Valdez and her former boss, Cabinet Secretary Leoncio Evasco Jr, also advocated that the government prioritize buying rice from local farmers, aside from extending permits given to private importers. They wanted the NFA buffer stock to be sourced from local farmers while industry stocks would be sourced through private sector-led importation. Aquino, meanwhile, approved the extension of some private importers and denied the extension of others, while championing government-to-government rice importation at a time when the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) said there was no need for such a scheme because the recent harvest by Filipino farmers will be enough to supply the NFA buffer stock. Duterte's understanding of issue But it appears that Duterte makes no distinction between these various modes of importation, lumping them up as one and making a blanket declaration that any official who supports importation does not have the best interests of local farmers at heart. On Monday, it was made even clearer how confused Duterte is about the issue. During a press conference before leaving for Saudi Arabia, he ordered Aquino to prioritize buying rice from local farmers and to only import if needed. Valdez believes the NFA Council, chaired by Evasco and comprised of agencies like the Deparrtment of Finance and NEDA, should \"move heaven and earth\" to meet with Duterte at the earliest opportunity in order to apprise him of their take on the issue. She cautioned the President against trusting the words of Aquino alone instead of the collective wisdom of the NFA Council, an inter-agency committee that decides on NFA policies as a body. \"Council decisions are backed up by hard evidence. NEDA gets data from PSA (Philippine Statistics Authority), from NIA (National Irrigation Administration). They use more sources as opposed to NFA which has only one source: itself,\" said Valdez. She also emphasized that officials who enjoy direct access to the President should not abuse this access. \"It's the moral obigation of those people surrounding the President to give him the right information, at the right time, [from] the right people,\" said Valdez. While the dismissed official did not name names, Palace sources have pointed to Special Assistant to the President Bong Go as the official facilitating communications between Duterte and Aquino. (READ: Growing rift between Duterte's trusted men \u2013 Jun Evasco, Bong Go? ) He is also the official who supposedly withheld from Duterte a confidential memorandum from Evasco intended to lay down his and the NFA Council's position on rice importation. When asked by Rappler about the issue, Go declined to comment. \u2013 Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

Despite the university's questionable financial situation, its Board of Trustees learned during an April 6 meeting about a contract negotiated with Jarrett to pay her a $30,000 speaking fee, according to the Chicago Sun-Times . \nOne board member reportedly called the decision to pay Jarrett \"disturbing.\" State representatives were also concerned about the decision. \n\"I\u2019m not certain that\u2019s the best use of funds, especially when it\u2019s public funds,\" Rep. Mark Batinick (R., Ill.) told the Sun-Times . \"If it\u2019s a private university, it\u2019s one thing, but a public university that\u2019s struggling, you would think someone would step up and graciously do the commencement.\" \nHowever, at least one board member wanted to keep Jarrett's contract, arguing that dismissing Jarrett would make first-generation minority students feel their commencement was \"lesser.\" \nThe university sent out an email statement on Monday revealing that a generous donor agreed to pay Jarrett's speaking fees. \n\"Since last week\u2019s Board of Trustees meeting, we have identified a generous donor who will cover the cost for our Commencement speaker,\" spokesman Mike Hines wrote. \"Valerie Jarrett is a role model for many of our graduating students as well as prospective students. We are pleased that she has agreed to be our Commencement speaker.\" \nNEIU cancelled classes last week and closed all of its campuses for three days last week as cost-cutting measures, and began furloughing employees.

The extensive use of carbon fibre and race technology in the Akula 310 left enthusiasts with a lot of hope that the production variant of the bike will be similar. \nHowever, a photo of what the production variant of the TVS Apache RTR 300 will look like is doing the rounds on the internet and it gives us a lot of new information about the upcoming motorcycle. Photo Credit - Twitter user/@PhantomRides \nThe Akula 310 was a track-focused concept and the road-spec motorcycle which will be launched by TVS in a couple of months in India will not be similar to it. The shape and design of the motorcycle has been broadly carried over from the Akula, and the particular bike in the picture does not feature any graphics. However, we expect TVS to put on some decals on the final production motorcycle. The speedometer is also vertically oriented just like the Akula 310 and seems to be an all digital affair. \nAlso Read: You can now buy your favourite TVS motorcycle at reduced price \nApart from the extensive use of carbon fibre, the Akula 310 had a more aggressive riding position but the bike in the picture seems to sport slightly raised clip-on handlebars. This is however not the final setup the production variant of the motorcycle will feature, and the handlebars could be lower, or adjustable in the final production motorcycle.

Previously a disguised version of the Apache RTR 300 was spotted on the roads but it was covered heavily with camouflage and did not tell a lot about the motorcycle.

Census \nBello said in New York that the Federal Government was expected to fund the exercise by only 51 per cent while the international donor community would fund the remaining 49 per cent. \n\u201cThe submission we have made to the Federal Government is in the region of N272 billion. But the good thing is that that the N272 billion is not for one single year. \n\u201cIt is spread along a four-year tenure. There\u2019s pre-census activities, that is the preparation; the actual census proper itself and the post-census enumeration activities. \n\u201cSo maybe you are looking at an average of maybe N40 billion in the first year, another N100 billion during the actual census itself and then the balance during the last year. \n\u201cBut the beauty again is that not all the resources are normally provided by the government of the federation. \n\u201cThe international community does come in and supporters like EU, USAID ; from the previous record that we have, the ratio is 51 to 49 per cent. \n\u201cThe 51 per cent is provided by the Federal Government while the 49 per cent is provided by the international donor community. \n\u201cTherefore, it is something that once government makes a proclamation, then it means that the country is ready and the international community will come and support the government,\u201d he said. \nBello also said there was the need for the government to leverage on the international community to help with the necessary assistance, adding that this would go a long way in defraying the cost. \n\u201cNormally, there is no country that does census on its own and more so, it is a very capital-intensive activity. Funding is important because we have to demarcate. \n\u201cThere is an exercise that is called Enumeration Area Demarcation which is supposed to be the foundation or the building block of census. \n\u201cAnd that is supposed to be carried out in every hamlet, every village, every local government, every household and then the entire nation. \n\u201cThat is normally a costly exercise, very expensive. And of course, up till now we have only been able to do 74 local governments out of 774. \n\u201cIt means we have done only 10 per cent. So for us to be able to do the remaining 700 local governments, it means there is a lot of work to do. \n\u201cEssentially we are on track; we have the capacity in-house but again there are quite a number of things, unless you are funded, you won\u2019t be able to move forward,\u2019\u2019 Bello said. \nAccording to him, census will enable the government to have correct data about its citizens in order to aid proper planning. \n\u201c That planning means you are going to optimise in terms of your allocation of resources to those sectors that really need that intervention. \n\u201cCensus has implication for trade, for manufacturing and for security because we will have the biometrics of every Nigerian. \n\u201cThen it means making life easy for security outfits like the police, EFCC, ICPC and the military because you can monitor even the scene of crime from the data that you have collected. \n\u201cSo serious countries actually collect data and it is the data that they use in order to govern their society,\u201d he said. adekunle", "highlightTitle": "", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.1Jr73HLc_IqhjYT0R0O9osie7MN6KwCKN3uFYni4ApBbBG72.0oZDNc03LJb35c19Qkj_4ERRI_Fs8leJ_fpe", "title": "2018 census to cost N272 bn \u2013 NPC", "ord_in_thread": 0, "uuid": "29a37bf4883b9dba819148eb6cdb5ac33ceea3fa", "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-09T10:18:23.945+03:00"}, {"highlightText": "", "author": "", "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tillerson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rex tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mikhail voskresenskiy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcmaster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xi jinping", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim jong-un", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dave benham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ed markey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carl vinson", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "korean peninsula", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea calls syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "western pacific", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south korea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pyongyang", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "u.s. navy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "us pacific command", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us navy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kcna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us national security council", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "thread": {"site_type": "news", "published": "2017-04-09T22:49:42.906+03:00", "performance_score": 9, "spam_score": 0.0, "uuid": "9b79d23e57e2463c96b18096a66752c07cf96803", "country": "RU", "replies_count": 0, "title": "US Top Diplomat Tillerson Claims China Ready for \u2018Action\u2019 on North Korea", "domain_rank": 1616, "site_categories": ["education", "business"], "main_image": "https://cdn3.img.sputniknews.com/images/102119/30/1021193079.jpg", "participants_count": 0, "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 10, "shares": 917, "likes": 917}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 22}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "site": "sputniknews.com", "section_title": "Sputnik International -

Dentistry is really expensive and when people lack funding to access the service it really makes it difficult for them to get proper dental care. They then tend to only seek out care when they\u2019re in pain,\u201d organizer Danielle Briere explained. \nREAD MORE: Dental hygienists offer free services for those in need \nBriere said the clinic has completely filled up with 200 people receiving treatment, including Aimee McCubbing who came from Rosetown with her family. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a regular dentist and for low income families and people that need help with their teeth it\u2019s a great opportunity,\u201d McCubbing said. \nThe day was made possible by $20,000 worth of donated supplies, not to mention a hundred dental professional volunteers. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to travel to other countries to do outreach work, we have so much need just in our own city. We can reach out to the people that need it,\u201d volunteer dentist Lauretta Gray said. \n\u201cIt\u2019s really eye opening to see how many people don\u2019t have access to oral healthcare who have huge needs.

Ashish Mehta /Dubai Filed on April 9, 2017 | Last updated on April 9, 2017 at 07.01 am Share \nAlamy Stock Photo Here are the norms for women working on night shift I work for a free zone company and have completed a year out of a 2-year unlimited contract. At this point, the employer is trying to force us to sign a paper on which we agree to work on night shifts. This request was not included in our contract or offer letter. My question is, can the company change the terms of contract midway? And, does the labour law apply here where it is stated that women cannot work after 10pm? Answer You have not stated in which free zone you are located in. Certain free zones have their own regulations pertaining to employees and others follow the Federal Law No. 8 of 1980 of UAE (the \"Employment Law). It is assumed that you fall within the authority of the Employment Law. Article 27 and Article 28 of the Employment Law deals with employment of women and night shifts, which reads as: \"Women may not be required to work at night. The term 'night' means a period of not less than 11 consecutive hours from 10pm to 7am.\" However, Article 28 provides for an exception to the forgoing \"The following cases shall be excepted from the clause prohibiting women to work at night. a) In the event where the work in the establishment is stopped due to force majeure. b) Work in responsible managerial and technical jobs. c) Work in medical and other services as may be decided by the Minister of Labour and Social Affairs if the working woman does not normally carry out a manual job.\" On perusal of the forgoing, it can be stated that unless you fall within the aforementioned exception or in the event that you sign the amendment to your labour contract you may not work in the night shift. It is recommended that, if you are being forced/coerced into signing an amended terms employment contract you should contact the relevant authority at the free zone for the purposes of a resolution between you and the employer. Visa renewal and criminal case A criminal case has been filed against me, a case in which my boss is also involved. As of now my passport is in police custody in Dubai, and my residence visa is expiring next month. What should I do now? What are the options open to me? It appears that you are released on bail by the public prosecution which has, in turn, retained your passport. Your passport will be in custody of the public prosecution at least until investigations are complete and you are found not guilty of a crime. In that case, the public prosecution will acquit you from the said complaint and will release your passport through the police station concerned. However, if your passport continues to be held, you could file an application with the public prosecution to arrange for presentation of your passport at the office of the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs, for renewal of your visa.

In his book, Robert O'Neill lays out the details of what went down that night inside the compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. Reuters file photo of Osama bin Laden. NEW YORK: An ex-Navy SEAL, who claims to have killed Osama bin Laden , has revealed that the al-Qaeda chief's head was so severely destroyed by his gunfire that it had to be pressed back together for identification. Ex-Navy SEAL team shooter Robert O'Neill has reasserted his claim that he alone pumped three bullets into Osama , killing the architect of the 9/11 attacks, in a new book. In 'The Operator: Firing the Shots that Killed Bin Laden', the former Navy SEAL Team 6 shooter lays out the details of what went down that night inside the compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, the New York Daily News reported. While controversy still swirls around O'Neill's version of the May 2, 2011, raid, much of it centers on his breaking the Special Ops code of silence. O'Neill, in his book, makes the gruesome claim that Osama's head was so severely destroyed by his gunfire that it had to be pressed back together for identification photographs. In O'Neill's version, he was trailing five or six other SEALs climbing the stairs to the compound's second floor when Osama's son Khalid appeared on the half-landing with an AK-47. The agents were able to lure Khalid from where he was hiding behind a banister by calling to him in Arabic, saying: 'Khalid, come here.' He shouted in response: 'What?' and emerged from his hiding spot, and was immediately shot in the face, the report said. Once upstairs, the men spread out to search the rooms. In the compound with Osama were three of his four wives and 17 children. O'Neill kept his hand on the point man's shoulder. The two were alone on the stairway, convinced that whoever was on the third floor was strapping on a suicide vest for an explosive last stand. O'Neill recounts that finally he decided to take action. He squeezed the point man's shoulder, the signal to charge and then burst past the curtain. The point man tackled two screaming women to the floor. Bin Laden stood near the bed, his hands on the shoulders of the woman in front of him. She was later identified as Amal, the youngest of his four wives, the report said. \"In less than a second, I aimed above the woman's right shoulder and pulled the trigger twice,\" O'Neill writes. \"Bin Laden's head split open, and he dropped. I put another bullet in his head. Insurance,\" he writes. According to O'Neill, the other members of the team rushed into the room only after he placed a 2-year-old boy found covering in a corner alongside Osama's widow on the bed. A harrowing 90-minute flight returned the squadron to camp in Afghanistan. O'Neill's book comes five years after \"No Easy Day,\" fellow SEAL Mark Bissonnette's account of the operation. He agreed to surrender the $6.8 million in proceeds from the book for his use of classified information and violation of a non-disclosure deal.

The petition claims to have been signed by 10 lakh women. \n\nAIMPLB made this claim citing a report based on RTI replies, family courts, Darul Qaza (Shariat courts) and independent studies from 30 districts. \n\nThis report was unveiled by AIMPLB's women's wing chief Asma Zohra during the inaugural of a two-day workshop on challenges before Muslim women in Jaipur on Saturday. \n\nThe central government has challenged the validity of triple talaq in the Supreme Court stating the practice to be against gender justice and spirit of the Constitution. \n\nAIMPLB, contesting the case in favour of triple talaq, will submit the report in the court to counter the argument that Muslims have highest number of divorce in the country due to the practice of triple talaq. \n\nCiting divorce data collected from a period between 2011 and 2016, Zohra said, \"Hindus constitute 56.21% of the total population in Kozhikode, alienate them\". \n\n\"Our report demolished the central government's basic premise that Muslims have high rate of divorce. I demand the central government to collect data on divorce cases nationally before attacking the most convenient way of talaq,\" said Farooqui, who has served as a legal counsellor for 12 years in a family court. \n\n\"If you spent years dissolving a marriage, then chances of rehabilitating become almost difficult. Triple talaq is more secure for women seeking divorce as it involves several rounds of negotiations. \n\nIt is in the eye of the storm because it is related to Islam,\" said Farooqui, who claimed that Muslims also have least number of separated couples which, she said, is the \"worst form of any relationship\".", "highlightTitle": "", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zC1.YsIxbbrrE6uDLfsznQUHANkG5.U0EweKrBPeX7fjcMEXCKZT95TrydbTVCV20cbhKCfR_Y7yWecYuP290zFNLj.p8TVBMKb8qW.qQ_XfgzhmAIONz7Q", "title": "\u2018Muslims have lower divorce rate than other groups\u2019 | India News", "ord_in_thread": 0, "uuid": "07ca21488ec85ad4abd7c385f0846751585ce42e", "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-10T03:23:34.918+03:00"}, {"highlightText": "", "author": "Pti Karachi", "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "naam shabana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manoj bajpayee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taapsee pannu", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pakistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karachi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamabad", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "atrium mall & cinemas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "thread": {"site_type": "news", "published": "2017-04-09T08:00:00.000+03:00", "performance_score": 9, "spam_score": 0.243, "uuid": "f70d72061783ee841b1b99c7713197ee96f7e27e", "country": "NO", "replies_count": 0, "title": "Bollywood movie banned in Pakistan ahead of release - Khaleej Times", "domain_rank": 7403, "site_categories": ["news", "education"], "main_image": "http://www.khaleejtimes.com/storyimage/KT/20170409/ARTICLE/170409268/AR/0/AR-170409268.jpg&NCS_modified=\r\n&imageversion=1by1&exif=.jpg", "participants_count": 0, "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 991, "likes": 991}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "site": "khaleejtimes.com", "section_title": "", "site_full": "www.khaleejtimes.com", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8A66W82FFsGuNXuSfmgBf_lGZSttJ7xjuk2QX6D1BJ.A8Yx42ZQtG5YChUXuWuqnMRZAap_ta6NwOVLn2hA5zHuB_D_nkXZwBX1oceNjzPXepH.1geuWPLXWGFRKfwUn4-", "site_section": "", "title_full": "Bollywood movie banned in Pakistan ahead of release - Khaleej Times"}, "external_links": [], "language": "english", "published": "2017-04-09T08:00:00.000+03:00", "text": "Bollywood movie banned in Pakistan ahead of release PTI /Karachi Filed on April 9, 2017 Share \nPeople stand outside a ticket counter at Atrium Mall & Cinemas in Karachi, Pakistan.

He said that some of the scenes related to terrorism were not fit enough to be shown. The officials at censor board were reluctant to allow its screening but the local distributor - Ever Ready Pictures - persuaded them to allow the release after editing. \"Naam Shabana\" stars Taapsee Pannu and Manoj Bajpayee in lead roles and was initially released in Pakistan on March 31. Pakistan banned the screening of Indian films last year after cross border tension between the two countries. The ban was, however, lifted at the start of this year allowing the screening of Indian films after approval by the censor board.

Image: ESA ALEXANDER Members of President Jacob Zuma\u2019s inner circle mocked South Africa\u2019s descent into junk status this week, treating the potential body blow to South Africa\u2019s economic wellbeing as a big joke. \nOne of them, Zuma\u2019s son Edward, said the ratings agencies \u201cdid us a favour, really\u201d. \nDisplaying a breathtaking ignorance of economics, Zuma\u2019s allies cheered the downgrade, which analysts warn could restrict the country to a low-growth path for decades. Time for Zuma to become part of history, not reality \nOne close Zuma ally, Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane, told a WhatsApp chat group: \u201cIt\u2019s actually better Western investors will pull back and we have an opportunity to bring them back in our own terms, after we have consolidated our relations with Africa and Brics. We must rearrange our foreign debt repayments.\u201d \nAnother member of the so-called Black Empowerment Foundation chat group, close Zuma associate and SAA chairwoman Dudu Myeni, replied to Mokonyane: \u201cI concur cdes. Let the rand fall and rise and emerge with the masses.\u201d \nWhile Zuma, once again, emerged victorious after a meeting of the ANC\u2019s extended national working committee, which many had hoped, in vain, would censure him, the economy will be the biggest loser, with some R80-billion wiped off banking stocks alone in less than a week, and the rand falling against the dollar. \nEconomists have also warned that the downgrade will hit the poor hard, as the cost of borrowing rises and a faltering rand plays havoc with the cost of imported goods, especially fuel. \nBut South Africans\u2019 concerns for their futures, their investments and their pensions were not shared by the inner circle. As tens of thousands of South Africans marched on Friday in an unprecedented show of protest against Zuma\u2019s misrule, the president\u2019s allies gloated. \nAnother Zuma ally, Black Business Council president Danisa Baloyi, told the group: \u201cWho really cares? \nMany South Africans don\u2019t have billions on the stock exchange. Those with money should transform this economy. Most black people are born in junk status so they aren\u2019t bothered.\u201d \nThe chat group is administered by Edward Zuma. It discussed the cabinet shake-up at length in the hours leading up to Zuma\u2019s axing of several ministers and deputy ministers last week, when veteran finance minister Pravin Gordhan was replaced with former home affairs minister Malusi Gigaba. It\u2019s actually better Western investors will pull back and we have an opportunity to bring them back in our own terms, after we have consolidated our relations with Africa and Brics \nEdward told the group: \u201cAm going to celebrate this grading decision tonight long overdue hence mama action they must go hang labantu [these people] really now.\u201d \nEdward, who has gained notoriety by hurling insults at his father\u2019s critics, appeared to know several hours beforehand that Gordhan would be axed, telling the group at 9pm: \u201cThat one is definitely going Rand or not he is out.\u201d \nAfter the ratings announcement on Monday, he said: \u201cBrics is the only way out of this hell on earth. They did us a favour really.\u201d \nAmong the prominent politicians in the chat group are new Communications Minister Ayanda Dlodlo, disgraced former SABC chairwoman Ellen Tshabalala, former South African Chamber of Business CEO Kevin Wakeford, Zuma\u2019s daughter, Thuthukile, and KwaZulu-Natal MECs Mthandeni Dlungwane and Bongi Sithole-Mlaba. \nMokonyane confirmed yesterday that she wrote the posts, but said her laughing at a post welcoming ratings downgrades did not mean she was not concerned about them. \n\u201cWhat did you expect me to do?\u201d she asked. \n\u201cYou want to assume that I\u2019m not horrified? Angithi kuyahlekwa noma k\u2019fiwe [Isn\u2019t it that one can still laugh even if there is a death]? Make your own conclusion baba, bye.\u201d \nTshabalala, who resigned as SABC chairwoman amid a scandal over allegedly false academic qualifications, was excited last week at the prospect of Gordhan losing his job. He had caused \u201csome of us real agony\u201d, she said. \n\u201cEvery dog has its day! He mobilized against me. Akahambe kahle! [Let him go well],\u201d she wrote. \nIn real terms, this week\u2019s two ratings downgrades, by S&P Global Ratings and later Fitch, have dire implications for the rand, which ended the week at R13.83 to the dollar. \nOn March 24, as Business Times reports today, the rand was the strongest-performing emerging-market currency. It is now the worst-performing of all 24 emerging-market currencies. \nOn Friday, Fitch said it believed last week\u2019s cabinet reshuffle would weaken standards of governance and public finances. Attention is now focused on the ratings decision from Moody\u2019s, which is due in June but could come out of cycle like those of the other agencies. \nA second sub-investment grade rating for local-currency debt would trigger a mandatory withdrawal by pension funds that have invested about $13-billion (R179-billion) in South Africa. \nAt home, Gordhan\u2019s axing is seen as a critical political turning point, laying bare a deep-seated divide within the ANC and its alliance partners. Cosatu and the SACP have called for Zuma to step down. \nThe call was echoed by ordinary South Africans, who, via political parties, civic organisations and in their private capacities, came together on Friday in a national stay-away. The protest action was joined by about 60,000 people, according to the government. \nOpposition parties are planning to keep up the pressure with a march to the Union Buildings in Pretoria on Wednesday, and further mass marches are being planned to coincide with a parliamentary motion of no confidence on April 18. \nZwelethu Jolobe, a lecturer in politics at the University of Cape Town, said the protests were proof that the ANC-led government was swimming against the tide. Ramatlhodi regrets helping Zuma to power \nHe said the marches were a good measure of the level of discontent in the country. \u201cWhenever you have a large amount of people marching against the leadership, it\u2019s an important measure of discontent.

His subsequent presence in Pakistan was never credibly explained. ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI: India declared on Monday a Pakistani military court's decision to award death sentence to Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav on charges of spying \"premeditated murder\", virtually snuffing out any prospect of a thaw in bilateral ties. Ties are, in fact, likely to be further strained with India viewing the Pakistani decision as farcical. Foreign secretary S Jaishankar made India's outrage evident by summoning Pakistani high commissioner Abdul Basit to protest the death sentence handed out by a secret court. Indian sources suspect that Jadhav, a retired Indian Navy personnel, was \"snatched\" by Pakistani agencies last year from Iran . His subsequent presence in Pakistan was never credibly explained. The Iranian government had also said that Jadhav, who was in that country, was not engaged in any illegal activity. \"Senior Pakistani figures have themselves cast doubt about the adequacy of evidence. The claim in the Inter-Services Public Relations release that Jadhav was provided with a defending officer during the so-called trial is clearly absurd in the circumstances,\" the government said. The reference was to former Pakistani NSA Sartaj Aziz telling the Pakistan Senate that there was nothing beyond statements against Jadhav. \"If this sentence against an Indian citizen, awarded without observing basic norms of law and justice, is carried out, the government and people of India will regard it as a case of premeditated murder,\" Jaishankar told Basit. Jadhav, who Pakistan claims was holding an alias as Hussein Mubarak Patel, was arrested on March 3, 2016 through what Islamabad said was a counter-intelligence operation in Balochistan's Mashkel. Pakistan army's media arm has said that Jadhav was arrested for alleged involvement in espionage and sabotage activities against that country. Following his arrest, Islamabad had released a video in which Jadhav was shown purportedly admitting his involvement in spying. Between March 25, 2016 and March 31, 2017, India had issued as many as 13 notes verbale for consular access to Jadhav but did not get any response from Islamabad. Pakistan, in fact, only sent a letter of assistance to India seeking help from Indian authorities to probe \"charges\" against him. \"The proceedings that have led to the sentence against Jadhav are farcical in the absence of any credible evidence against him,\" the government said in a statement, adding that it was significant that India's high commissioner had not even been informed that Jadhav was being brought to trial. Aziz had been quoted as saying before the Pakistan Senate that there was \"insufficient\" evidence to prove terror charges against Jadhav. Aziz had said the dossier on Jadhav contained \"mere statements\" and lacked any \"conclusive evidence\". He had called for more \"matter\" on the \"spy\". While Pakistan claimed that Jadhav was a commander-rank officer with Indian Navy, India said he retired from the Navy in 2002 and had nothing to do with the Indian government. Jadhav's family has also said he was not a serving officer any more. \"We don't believe he is a spy because had he been one, he wouldn't have been carrying an Indian passport,\" said a source here. Jadav's Indian passport was in the name of Hussein Mubarak Patel. It is also interesting that Islamabad had disclosed Jadhav's arrest last year days before a Pakistani team visited Pathankot to investigate the attack on the airbase. India acknowledged that Jadhav had worked with the Navy in the past and it insisted he had nothing to do with the government. India believes that Jadhav might have been a businessman operating out of Chabahar in Iran. In an interesting twist to the case, former German ambassador to Pakistan Gunter Mulack claimed to have information that Jadhav had been abducted by Taliban from near the Balochistan-Afghanistan border and later \"sold\" to ISI. India believes that by denying it consular access to Jadhav, Pakistan acted in violation of the Vienna Convention on consular relations which says \"consular officers shall have the right to visit a national of the sending state (India) who is in prison, custody or detention, to converse and correspond with him and to arrange for his legal representation\". Islamabad used the arrest of Jadhav to claim \"evidence\" that India's external intelligence agency RAW was fomenting terrorism in Balochistan. It has repeatedly briefed envoys of EU and P-5 nations about Jadhav's \"subversive activities\" in Balochistan.

By Carolyn Gregoire Blake Sinclair via Getty Images \nMigraines are never pleasant, but new research suggests that they may have a more damaging effect on mental health than we realized. \nNew research from the University of Toronto, published online last month in the journal Headache , found that people with migraines are three times more likely to develop generalized anxiety disorder than those who do not suffer from migraines. \nFor the study, the researchers analyzed mental health surveys from more than 2,200 Canadian adults with migraines and nearly 20,000 adults without migraines. The analysis revealed that 2 percent of people without migraines suffer from generalized anxiety disorder, compared to 6 percent of people with migraines. \nAnd despite the fact that anxiety is much more common in women, the study showed that men with migraines were two times more likely to develop anxiety than women with migraines. \n\u201cWe were surprised at the finding because women usually have a higher prevalence of anxiety disorders than men,\u201d said Dr. Esme Fuller-Thomson, a professor of social work at the University of Toronto and the study\u2019s lead author. The researchers speculate that men who have migraines are more susceptible to anxiety disorders because they\u2019re less likely than women to take medication for pain, \u201cso their migraine symptoms may be more severe and anxiety producing.\u201d \nThere are many possible reasons for the migraine-anxiety connection, including biological, environmental and emotional factors. Debilitating chronic pain (which 30 percent of migraine sufferers said they experienced) and difficulties managing household responsibilities (which 28 percent said they experienced) were the two main factors causing anxiety in migraine patients, according to the study. \n\u201cWe were not surprised that chronic pain played a strong role in the link between migraines and generalized anxiety disorders,\u201d said study co-author Dr. Janay Jayanthikumar, who is a researcher in social work at the University of Toronto. \u201cThe unpredictable and uncontrollable nature of migraine pain can be extremely anxiety-producing, as it often interferes with family and work responsibilities with little or no warning.\u201d \nLack of social support was also a huge factor \u2015 those who did not have at least one close friend to confide in were five times more likely to have anxiety. It\u2019s well known that social support is one of the most important tools we have for protecting mental health. \nAlthough migraines and mental health issues are rarely discussed together, research has identified many links between the two. People with migraines are also twice as likely to suffer from depression, and previous research suggests that migraines are more common in patients with bipolar disorder. Studies have also shown that people with migraines are more likely to have panic disorders and agoraphobia. \nFuller-Thomson urged medical professionals to be more aware of these issues when treating their patients. \n\u201cDoctors and other health professionals need to be especially aware of the fact that their migraine patients may be experiencing mental health problems such as depression and anxiety disorders,\u201d Fuller-Thomson said. \u201cTargeted screening for these problems and referral to mental health professionals may be warranted for patients with migraines who are particularly vulnerable.\u201d ALSO ON HUFFPOST The Worst Things You Could Say To A Person With Anxiety The Worst Things You Could Say To A Person With Anxiety 1", "highlightTitle": "", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOgUFv1LMEbjybJKFYJWGIW7orOKf2yIvKC.D_nm7r7TF_DFvKqNSvkLGNaYsqHWy9Dp_9sHGcYJPg--", "title": "People With Migraines Are Three Times More Likely To Have Anxiety", "ord_in_thread": 0, "uuid": "327de54b5e10f501532fa9f2bde67b846b6645f9", "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-10T13:07:44.708+03:00"}, {"highlightText": "", "author": "", "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [{"name": "uae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dubai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mezairaa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oman sea", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "khaleej times", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "national center of meteorology & seismology", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "thread": {"site_type": "news", "published": "2017-04-11T07:57:12.299+03:00", "performance_score": 9, "spam_score": 0.0, "uuid": "b9fbb1231133d82e5c689848827429055d4ba534", "country": "NO", "replies_count": 0, "title": "UAE Weather: Dubai to reach 40C this week", "domain_rank": 7403, "site_categories": ["news", "education"], "main_image": "http://www.khaleejtimes.com/storyimage/KT/20170411/ARTICLE/170419870/AR/0/AR-170419870.jpg&NCS_modified=\r\n&imageversion=1by1&exif=.jpg", "participants_count": 0, "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 932, "likes": 932}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "site": "khaleejtimes.com", "section_title": "KT Mobile", "site_full": "www.khaleejtimes.com", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8A66W82FFsGuNXuSfmgBf_W9AEaXpE8KcNaW5WUEks3P.XpBAgm5Jsh_xz70KfpLXbJ1Q4M2kBXHLRImeBWBTzghMVOnabz19pjuJqY_qJfw--", "site_section": "http://www.khaleejtimes.com/services/rss/health/rss.xml\r", "title_full": "UAE Weather: Dubai to reach 40C this week"}, "external_links": [], "language": "english", "published": "2017-04-11T07:57:12.299+03:00", "text": "(Khaleej Times) Residents can brace themselves for the rising temperature.

the CBC, not merely broadcast by it. \nHeld at the gorgeous Walter Allward-designed limestone memorial in France on the piece of land that is by dint of blood a part of Canada, the government-planned show featured trilingual singers, children\u2019s choirs, dancers, Canadian performers all acting out the story. Suitably sombre politicians and dignitaries gave predictable speeches and said predictable things. \nAside from the setting, a few nods to the fact that Vimy was the first time the four divisions of the Canadian Corps had fought together, a bagpiper, a little military music \u2014 and of course the names of the dead on the walls \u2013 it could have passed for any Ottawa-centric bit of business. \nThere was no mention that I heard or saw of the 40 infantry and armoured regiments, which came from every corner of the country, who now carry Vimy 1917 as either a battle honour or a guidon (which the armoured regiments carry in lieu of a colour). \nThey are: \n\u2014 The 48 th Highlanders of Canada (Toronto, Ont.) \n\u2014 The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise\u2019s) (Hamilton, Ont.) \n\u2014 The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada (Montreal, Que.) \n\u2014 The Calgary Highlanders (Calgary, Alta.) \n\u2014 The Cameron Highlanders of Ottawa (Ottawa, Ont.) \n\u2014 The Canadian Grenadier Guards (Montreal, Que.) \n\u2014 The Canadian Scottish Regiment (Princess Mary\u2019s) (Victoria, B.C.) \n\u2014 The Cape Breton Highlanders (Sydney, N.S.) \n\u2014 The Essex and Kent Scottish Regiment (Windsor, Ont.) \n\u2014 Governor General\u2019s Foot Guards (Ottawa, Ont.) \n\u2014 The Lake Superior Scottish Regiment (Thunder Bay, Ont.) \n\u2014 The Loyal Edmonton Regiment (Edmonton, Alta.) \n\u2014 The North Saskatchewan Regiment (Saskatoon, Sask.) \n\u2014 The Nova Scotia Highlanders (Truro, N.S.) \n\u2014 The Princess of Wales\u2019 Own Regiment (Kingston, Ont.) \n\u2014 Princess Patricia\u2019s Canadian Light Infantry (Edmonton, Alta., and Shilo, Man.) \n\u2014 The Queen\u2019s Own Cameron Highlanders of Canada (Winnipeg, Man.) \n\u2014 The Queen\u2019s Own Rifles of Canada (Toronto, Ont.) \n\u2014 Royal 22 nd Regiment (Valcartier, Quebec City, Laval, Saint-Hyacinthe, Que.) \n\u2014 The Royal Canadian Regiment (Petawawa and London, Ont. and Gagetown, N.B.) \n\u2014 The Royal Hamilton Light Infantry (Hamilton, Ont.) \n\u2014 The Royal Montreal Regiment (Montreal, Que.) \n\u2014 The Royal New Brunswick Regiment (Fredericton, N.B.) \n\u2014 The Royal Regiment of Canada (Toronto, Ont.) \n\u2014 The Royal Regina Rifles (Regina, Sask.) \n\u2014 The Royal Westminster Regiment (New Westminster, B.C.) \n\u2014 Royal Winnipeg Rifles (Winnipeg, Man.) \n\u2014 The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada (Vancouver, B.C.) \n\u2014 The Toronto Scottish Regiment (Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother\u2019s Own) (Mississauga, Ont.) \n\u2014 1 st Hussars (London, Ont.) \n\u2014 The British Columbia Dragoons (Kelowna, B.C.) \n\u2014 The British Columbia Regiment (Duke of Connaught\u2019s Own) (Vancouver, B.C.) \n\u2014 The Governor General\u2019s Horse Guards (Toronto, Ont.) \n\u2014 The King\u2019s Own Calgary Regiment (Calgary, Alta.) \n\u2014 The Ontario Regiment (Oshawa, Ont.) \n\u2014 The Queen\u2019s York Rangers (1 st American Regiment) (Toronto, Ont.) \n\u2014 The Royal Canadian Hussars (Montreal, Que.) \n\u2014 The Saskatchewan Dragoons (Moose Jaw, Sask.) \n\u2014 The Sherbrooke Hussars (Sherbrooke, Que.) \n\u2014 The South Alberta Light Horse (Medicine Hat, Alta.) \nThe regiments are the everyday keepers of memory and tradition, as a wise friend reminds me, those who \u201cthrough their own voluntary service have taken on that sacred task of keeping the memory and honour alive in perpetuity.\u201d \nFrom Kelowna to Sydney, they were urban and rural, French and English, immigrant and indigenous Canadian, but at Vimy Ridge, on that battlefield of corpses, boot deep in mud, deafened by artillery, they didn\u2019t fight as hyphenated Canadians. \nIt was enough that they all were Canadian, period. \nIt still is. \nOf the 40 regiments with Vimy colours or guidons, 37 are reserve units, what used to be called the militia. \nThe troops are part-time soldiers, citizen soldiers. Many are still in school, or work regular jobs and parade a night a week and the weekend at the armoury. These young men and women are among the best, smartest and proudest in the country. \nCanada couldn\u2019t have taken Vimy Ridge without citizen soldiers. Canada couldn\u2019t have been in Afghanistan for nearly a decade without citizen soldiers. \nAnd yet, unacknowledged publicly, the reserve regiments are starving. Funding for the military generally has been shrinking since the end of the Afghanistan mission in 2010, but the reserve, as ever, bears more than its share of the burden \u2014 thanks not to government, but to the bureaucrats in the regular army who have been waging a quiet war against the reserves for years. \nA Department of National Defence report earlier this year showed the reserves have 5,293 vacant positions, most in the army reserve. That\u2019s 25 per cent under strength. \nThis is how it worked. \nSay, a reserve unit might lose 20 men and women a year to attrition and the like; it was allowed to recruit only five new people: thus, every year, the unit was down by 15 people. That\u2019s gone on for five years. \nThe abysmal recruiting policy \u2014 it was centralized, with the result that applicants could wait years \u2014 has been handed back to the regiments. But the reserves have been told their budgets this year will be 10 per cent less than they received last year when the whole institution was short 25 per cent of its authorized number of soldiers. \nIt\u2019s funny, but as Prince Charles said Sunday of Vimy, \u201cThis was Canada at its best,\u201d and it was: politicians, leaders, the army, and most of all the troops. As my wise friend reminds me, \u201cIt was service before self. We could do anything.\u201d \nThe scale of accomplishment and sacrifice at Vimy Ridge merits more than saccharine remembrance, particularly that even as it unfolds, the very regiments that gave so much are once again in jeopardy.

The investigation comes after a complaint was phoned in to the network's corporate hotline last week by Wendy Walsh, a former regular guest on Fox's \"The O'Reilly Factor\" TV show, and her lawyer, Lisa Bloom, which the two posted to YouTube.\n\"21st Century Fox investigates all complaints and we have asked the law firm Paul Weiss to continue assisting the company in these serious matters,\" the company said in a statement.  \n\nWalsh, a psychologist and radio host, said O'Reilly reneged on an offer to secure her a lucrative job on the network after she declined his invitation to join him in his hotel suite after a dinner in early 2013.\n\"I'm told that they are taking it seriously, and they are going to do the investigation that's legally required of them,\" Bloom told CNN on Sunday.\n\nFox and O'Reilly have paid $13 million to five women who accused him of sexual harassment, the New York Times reported last weekend. O'Reilly said in a statement then that he had been unfairly targeted because of his prominence and has not made further comment.\nNumerous companies have pulled ads from O'Reilly's Fox News show since the report, including BMW of North America, Allstate Corp, French pharmaceuticals maker Sanofi SA, direct marketer Constant Contact, men's clothing company Untuckit and mutual fund operator T. Rowe Price. British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline Plc said it temporarily suspended its advertising.\n\nFox News, the top-rated cable news network, has faced heightened scrutiny of its workplace climate after sexual harassment allegations led to the resignation of founding Chairman Roger Ailes last year.\n21st Century Fox hired law firm Paul Weiss to investigate Ailes.\n\nOn April 3, Democratic political consultant and Fox News contributor Julie Roginsky sued the network and Ailes, accusing them of denying her a permanent hosting job after she rebuffed Ailes' sexual advances.\nRoginsky said that a misogynistic culture at Fox News had not changed since Ailes left the network.\n\n(Additional reporting by Lisa Richwine in Los Angeles; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)", "highlightTitle": "", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJYyyL7JVzYFB0p.lk6kCm1kuAMNQ5ncHL8VJTp81O4svd60ZtmFormOA_68C49S7QdMb0VbPM_b31H3lh_teWAwAPjHSu8uUW0q4WEXkjE7U4C4bEZ6hC5Q--", "title": "Fox to investigate sexual harassment claim against O'Reilly", "ord_in_thread": 0, "uuid": "d53f5fac9c39013c2df65a36b6770068ab3fbcbd", "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-10T04:23:52.159+03:00"}, {"highlightText": "", "author": "Fe Online", "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "sachin tendulkar", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sachin tend", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "snell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dalo", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sachin tendulkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "financial express sachin tendulkar", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "isi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world health organisation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "department of transportation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court of india", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "thread": {"site_type": "news", "published": "2017-04-10T19:44:00.000+03:00", "performance_score": 9, "spam_score": 0.01, "uuid": "35facb6cf18dd6defacb2d8bca8420abb54e5ba9", "country": "US", "replies_count": 0, "title": "Sachin Tendulkar urges riders to wear helmet while being chased for a photo, watch video - The Financial Express", "domain_rank": 4726, "site_categories": ["news", "education", "business"], "main_image": "http://images.financialexpress.com/2017/04/sachin-tendulkar-master-blaster-helmet-wearing-twitter-thumbnail.jpg", "participants_count": 0, "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 914, "likes": 914}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "site": "financialexpress.com", "section_title": "", "site_full": "www.financialexpress.com", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.YuZjPcTcrfKQXWWp.8B_z87wDFwH_p5t.Crznf8YsDy7IJEhhVW44VbHhszKzWox0xTmqAKKy7VLfbUlH5TvMPO66tiG2haukkKhbxi8OW_psl66.syBQalhZodFqTtIwhsFbThh4NHHyoXJa3Jt0FdMZp.FAmEI9SCrK6bPMuj_jzUo9UWwH", "site_section": "", "title_full": "Sachin Tendulkar urges riders to wear helmet while being chased for a photo, watch video - The Financial Express"}, "external_links": [], "language": "english", "published": "2017-04-10T19:44:00.000+03:00", "text": "Sachin Tendulkar urges riders to wear helmet while being chased for a photo, watch video Sachin Tendulkar urges riders to wear helmet while being chased for a photo, watch video In a recent twitter update from Sachin Tendulkar's official twitter handle, the God of Cricket tells his fans who want to click a picture with him while riding their two-wheeler to wear a helmet. What was the fan's reaction? Read on to find out! By: FE Online | Updated: April 10, 2017 1:21 PM Road accidents involving two-wheelers can lead to death if the rider isn't wearing a helmet \nTraffic norms are implemented in various cities for a reason! While most commuters follow it from the perspective of not being fined, the essence is to protect a rider or a driver in the event of a crash. One such critical traffic rule that is flouted by a number of commuters on a daily basis is not wearing a helmet. According to World Health Organisation, the chances of a motorist riding on public roads without a helmet has a 40 percent higher chance of death when compared to the case where he wears one. In a recent video on Sachin Tendulkar 's twitter handle, he agrees to some selfie shots with a passerby on the road who are not wearing a helmet while riding a two-wheeler. He asks for a promise from these fans to wear a helmet while riding a two-wheeler to which they agree. The aspect that was disappointing to the Master Blaster was the fan here wasn't wearing a helmet. \nIn the 19 second video, the 'God of Cricket' is seen asking his fan to wear a helmet and also insists how precious life is. Another passerby, who is also not wearing a helmet catches a glimpse of the legend when he re-states that wearing a helmet is important for his safety. We hope that a number of such twitter fans who have seen the video start following the simple rule of wearing a helmet. According to the 2015 Road Accidents in India statistic report, two-wheeler accidents have witnessed a consistent and alarming increase in their share of road fatalities as well as injuries. The share of two-wheeler accidents has increased from 26.3 percent in 2013 to 28.8 percent in 2015. Out of the total number of 1.44 lakh accidents that have taken place in 2015 involving two-wheelers, 36,803 people have died, while 1.35 lakh persons were seriously injured. \nHelmet Dalo!! Road safety should be the highest priority for everyone. Please don't ride without a helmet. pic.twitter.com/xjgXzjKwQj \n\u2014 sachin tendulkar (@sachin_rt) April 9, 2017 \nWearing a helmet while riding a two-wheeler is imperative and India has the largest number of two-wheelers sold every year. While there are sub-standard helmets that can be bought from roadside vendors, there are certain norms set by helmet companies who also emphasise on purchasing at least an ISI marked helmet. Moreover, the recent rule passed by the Supreme Court of India has also ensured that new two-wheeler buyers have to purchase a helmet with a certain quality standard. Another factor that begs to be answered in this aspect is that when a person can buy a two-wheeler which may have been financed, why not also invest in a proper rated helmet. \nAlso Read: How programmes like Indian Road Safety Mission are improving road safety but a lot is still missing \nThere are international companies that sell branded helmets through its various distributors which go through a number of tests by international helmet testing agencies such as SHARP (Safety Helmet Assessment and Rating Programme), DOT (Department of Transportation) or Snell, a non-profit organisation dealing with helmet safety since 1957. These helmets do cost upward of Rs 4,000 which have adequate cushion to protect the rider, however, most two-wheeler owners in India choose a sub-standard helmet in the interest of saving some money. Is the life of a two-wheeler rider that cheap in India?

The income cap will be raised incrementally over the next three years, to $110,000 in 2018 and $125,000 in 2019. \nState lawmakers agreed to include the tuition-free plan, which Gov. Andrew Cuomo introduced in January, in the state budget they approved late Sunday night. The budget includes a record $7.5 billion for higher education. \n\u201cThere is no child who will go to sleep tonight and say I have great dreams, but I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll be able to get a college education because parents can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Cuomo said in a statement on Saturday. \u201cWith this program, every child will have the opportunity that education provides.\u201d \nStudents must be enrolled full-time with at least 30 credits per year in order to qualify, and they are expected to cover housing costs. After students graduate, they are expected to live and work in New York for the same number of years funding was accepted. If students choose to leave the state, the scholarship would immediately convert into a loan. \nScholarship funds are accounting for other federal and state grants. More than 50 percent of students at State University of New York (SUNY) and City University of New York (CUNY) colleges are already paying nothing for tuition with state and federal need-based grants. Those students would not be eligible for the scholarship. \nPrivate school students from families making under the income cap would also benefit. Eligible students would get a maximum of $3,000. \nTennessee, Oregon, and Minnesota already have tuition free for two-year colleges, but New York is the first to extend coverage to four-year colleges. This comes just a week after Sen.

We hope that the Philippines can work with us to continue to properly handle differences and create favorable atmosphere for the sound and steady growth of bilateral relations,\" the spokesperson said. \nDuterte earlier ordered the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to occupy the country's controlled islets and land features in the South China Sea. \nThe president, however, clarified that there are no new weapons being eyed for the islets as the Philippine military seeks to exercise greater control. \n\u201cWe are just there to claim the island for us because that is really ours and I have ordered the AFP to build structures there to signify, atin ito,\" Duterte said before departing for Saudi Arabia . \nThe president made the order for the military to occupy South China Sea following reports that China is nearly finished with its construction of military facilities on three islands in the Spratly Group.

Trump, the New York City businessman-turned-president, berated then-President Barack Obama back in September 2013 about the fallacy of an American military strike against Syria. At that time, the United States was considering the use of force against Syria in response to allegations (since largely disproven) that the regime of President Bashar al-Assad had used chemical weapons against civilians in the Damascus suburb of Ghouta. Trump, via tweet, declared \u201cto our very foolish leader, do not attack Syria \u2013 if you do many very bad things will happen & from that fight the U.S. gets nothing!\u201d President Obama, despite having publicly declaring the use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime a \u201cred line\u201d which, if crossed, would demand American military action, ultimately declined to order an attack, largely on the basis of warnings by James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, that the intelligence linking the chemical attack on Ghouta was less than definitive. President Barack Obama, in a 2016 interview with The Atlantic , observed, \u201cthere\u2019s a playbook in Washington that presidents are supposed to follow. It\u2019s a playbook that comes out of the foreign-policy establishment. And the playbook prescribes responses to different events, and these responses tend to be militarized responses.\u201d While the \u201cWashington playbook,\u201d Obama noted, could be useful during times of crisis, it could \u201calso be a trap that can lead to bad decisions.\u201d His \u201cred line\u201d on chemical weapons usage, combined with heated rhetoric coming from his closest advisors, including Secretary of State John Kerry, hinting at a military response, was such a trap. Ultimately, President Obama opted to back off, observing that \u201cdropping bombs on someone to prove that you\u2019re willing to drop bombs on someone is just about the worst reason to use force.\u201d The media, Republicans and even members of his own party excoriated Obama for this decision. Yet, in November 2016, as president-elect, Donald Trump doubled down on Obama\u2019s eschewing of the \u201cWashington playbook.\u201d The situation on the ground in Syria had fundamentally changed since 2013; the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) had taken over large swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria, establishing a \u201ccapital\u201d in the Syrian city of Raqqa and declaring the creation of an Islamic \u201cCaliphate.\u201d American efforts to remove Syrian President Assad from power had begun to bar fruit, forcing Russia to intervene in September 2015 in order to prop up the beleaguered Syrian president. Trump, breaking from the mainstream positions held by most American policy makers, Republican and Democrat alike, declared that the United States should focus on fighting and defeating the Islamic State (ISIS) and not pursuing regime change in Syria. \u201cMy attitude,\u201d Trump noted, \u201cwas you\u2019re fighting Syria, Syria is fighting ISIS, and you have to get rid of ISIS. Russia is now totally aligned with Syria, and now you have Iran, which is becoming powerful, because of us, is aligned with Syria... Now we\u2019re backing rebels against Syria, and we have no idea who these people are.\u201d Moreover, Trump observed, given the robust Russian presence inside Syria, if the United States attacked Assad, \u201cwe end up fighting Russia, fighting Syria.\u201d For more than two months, the new Trump administration seemed to breathe life into the notion that Donald Trump had, like his predecessor before him, thrown the \u201cWashington playbook\u201d out the window when it came to Syrian policy. After ordering a series of new military deployments into Syria and Iraq specifically designed to confront ISIS, the Trump administration began to give public voice to a major shift in policy vis-\u00e0-vis the Syrian President. For the first time since President Obama, in August 2011, articulated regime change in Damascus as a precondition for the cessation of the civil conflict that had been raging since April 2011, American government officials articulated that this was no longer the case. \u201cYou pick and choose your battles,\u201d the American Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, told reporters on March 30, 2017. \u201cAnd when we\u2019re looking at this, it\u2019s about changing up priorities and our priority is no longer to sit and focus on getting Assad out.\u201d Haley\u2019s words were echoed by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who observed that same day, while on an official visit to Turkey, \u201cI think the\u2026 longer-term status of President Assad will be decided by the Syrian people.\u201d This new policy direction lasted barely five days. Sometime in the early afternoon of April 4, 2017, troubling images and video clips began to be transmitted out of the Syrian province of Idlib by anti-government activists, including members of the so-called \u201cWhite Helmets,\u201d a volunteer rescue team whose work was captured in an eponymously-named Academy Award-winning documentary film. These images showed victims in various stages of symptomatic distress, including death, from what the activists said was exposure to chemical weapons dropped by the Syrian air force on the town of Khan Sheikhoun that very morning. Images of these tragic deaths were immediately broadcast on American media outlets, with pundits decrying the horrific and heinous nature of the chemical attack, which was nearly unanimously attributed to the Syrian government, even though the only evidence provided was the imagery and testimony of the anti-Assad activists who, just days before, were decrying the shift in American policy regarding regime change in Syria. President Trump viewed these images, and was deeply troubled by what he saw, especially the depictions of dead and suffering children. Drew Angerer via Getty Images The images were used as exhibits in a passionate speech by Haley during a speech at the Security Council on April 5, 2017, where she confronted Russia and threatened unilateral American military action if the Council failed to respond to the alleged Syrian chemical attack. \u201cYesterday morning, we awoke to pictures, to children foaming at the mouth, suffering convulsions, being carried in the arms of desperate parents,\u201d Haley said, holding up two examples of the images provided by the anti-Assad activists. \u201cWe saw rows of lifeless bodies, some still in diapers\u2026we cannot close our eyes to those pictures. We cannot close our minds of the responsibility to act.\u201d If the Security Council refused to take action against the Syrian government, Haley said, then \u201cthere are times in the life of states that we are compelled to take our own action.\u201d In 2013, President Barack Obama was confronted with images of dead and injured civilians, including numerous small children, from Syria that were every bit as heartbreaking as the ones displayed by Ambassador Haley. His Secretary of State, John Kerry, had made an impassioned speech that all but called for military force against Syria. President Obama asked for, and received, a wide-range of military options from his national security team targeting the regime of President Assad; only the intervention of James Clapper, and the doubts that existed about the veracity of the intelligence linking the Ghouta chemical attack to the Syrian government, held Obama back from giving the green light for the bombing to begin. Like President Obama before him, President Trump asked for his national security team to prepare options for military action. Unlike his predecessor, Donald Trump did not seek a pause in his decision making process to let his intelligence services investigate what had actually occurred in Khan Sheikhoun. Like Nikki Haley, Donald Trump was driven by his visceral reaction to the imagery being disseminated by anti-Assad activists. In the afternoon of April 6, as he prepared to depart the White House for a summit meeting with a delegation led by the Chinese President Xi Jinping, Trump\u2019s own cryptic words in response to a reporter\u2019s question about any American response seem to hint that his mind was already made up. \u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d he said, before walking away. Within hours, a pair of U.S. Navy destroyers launched 59 advanced Block IV Tomahawk cruise missiles (at a cost of some $1.41 million each), targeting aircraft, hardened shelters, fuel storage, munitions supply, air defense and communications facilities at the Al Shayrat air base, located in central Syria. Al Shayrat was home to two squadrons of Russian-made SU-22 fighter-bombers operated by the Syrian air force, one of which was tracked by American radar as taking off from Al Sharyat on the morning of April 4, 2017, and was overhead Khan Sheikhoun around the time the alleged chemical attack occurred. The purpose of the American strike was two-fold; first, to send a message to the Syrian government and its allies that, according to Secretary of State Tillerson, \u201cthe president is willing to take decisive action when called for,\u201d and in particular when confronted with evidence of a chemical attack from which the United States could not \u201cturn away, turn a blind eye.\u201d The other purpose, according to a U.S. military spokesperson, to \u201creduce the Syrian government\u2019s ability to deliver chemical weapons.\u201d Moreover, the policy honeymoon the Trump administration had only recently announced about regime change in Syria was over. \u201cIt\u2019s very, very possible, and, I will tell you, it\u2019s already happened, that my attitude toward Syria and Assad has changed very much,\u201d President Trump told reporters before the missile strikes had commenced . Secretary Tillerson went further: \u201cIt would seem there would be no role for him [Assad] to govern the Syrian people.\u201d Such a reversal in policy fundamentals and direction in such a short period of time is stunning; Donald Trump didn\u2019t simply deviate slightly off course, but rather did a complete 180-degree turn. The previous policy of avoiding entanglement in the internal affairs of Syria in favor of defeating ISIS and improving relations with Russia had been replaced by a fervent embrace of regime change, direct military engagement with the Syrian armed forces, and a confrontational stance vis-\u00e0-vis the Russian military presence in Syria. Normally, such major policy change could only be explained by a new reality driven by verifiable facts. The alleged chemical weapons attack against Khan Sheikhoun was not a new reality; chemical attacks had been occurring inside Syria on a regular basis, despite the international effort to disarm Syria\u2019s chemical weapons capability undertaken in 2013 that played a central role in forestalling American military action at that time. International investigations of these attacks produced mixed results, with some being attributed to the Syrian government (something the Syrian government vehemently denies), and the majority being attributed to anti-regime fighters, in particular those affiliated with Al Nusra Front, an Al Qaeda affiliate. Moreover, there exists a mixed provenance when it comes to chemical weapons usage inside Syria that would seem to foreclose any knee-jerk reaction that placed the blame for what happened at Khan Sheikhoun solely on the Syrian government void of any official investigation. Yet this is precisely what occurred. Some sort of chemical event took place in Khan Sheikhoun; what is very much in question is who is responsible for the release of the chemicals that caused the deaths of so many civilians. No one disputes the fact that a Syrian air force SU-22 fighter-bomber conducted a bombing mission against a target in Khan Sheikhoun on the morning of April 4, 2017. The anti-regime activists in Khan Sheikhoun, however, have painted a narrative that has the Syrian air force dropping chemical bombs on a sleeping civilian population. A critical piece of information that has largely escaped the reporting in the mainstream media is that Khan Sheikhoun is ground zero for the Islamic jihadists who have been at the center of the anti-Assad movement in Syria since 2011. Up until February 2017, Khan Sheikhoun was occupied by a pro-ISIS group known as Liwa al-Aqsa that was engaged in an oftentimes-violent struggle with its competitor organization, Al Nusra Front (which later morphed into Tahrir al-Sham, but under any name functioning as Al Qaeda\u2019s arm in Syria) for resources and political influence among the local population. Ammar Abdullah / Reuters A man breathes through an oxygen mask as another one receives treatments, after what rescue workers described as a suspected gas attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in rebel-held Idlib, Syria April 4, 2017. The Russian Ministry of Defense has claimed that Liwa al-Aqsa was using facilities in and around Khan Sheikhoun to manufacture crude chemical shells and landmines intended for ISIS forces fighting in Iraq. According to the Russians the Khan Sheikhoun chemical weapons facility was mirrored on similar sites uncovered by Russian and Syrian forces following the reoccupation of rebel-controlled areas of Aleppo. In Aleppo, the Russians discovered crude weapons production laboratories that filled mortar shells and landmines with a mix of chlorine gas and white phosphorus; after a thorough forensic investigation was conducted by military specialists, the Russians turned over samples of these weapons, together with soil samples from areas struck by weapons produced in these laboratories, to investigators from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for further evaluation. Al Nusra has a long history of manufacturing and employing crude chemical weapons; the 2013 chemical attack on Ghouta made use of low-grade Sarin nerve agent locally synthesized, while attacks in and around Aleppo in 2016 made use of a chlorine/white phosphorous blend. If the Russians are correct, and the building bombed in Khan Sheikhoun on the morning of April 4, 2017 was producing and/or storing chemical weapons, the probability that viable agent and other toxic contaminants were dispersed into the surrounding neighborhood, and further disseminated by the prevailing wind, is high. The counter-narrative offered by the Russians and Syrians, however, has been minimized, mocked and ignored by both the American media and the Trump administration. So, too, has the very illogic of the premise being put forward to answer the question of why President Assad would risk everything by using chemical weapons against a target of zero military value, at a time when the strategic balance of power had shifted strongly in his favor. Likewise, why would Russia, which had invested considerable political capital in the disarmament of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons capability after 2013, stand by idly while the Syrian air force carried out such an attack, especially when their was such a heavy Russian military presence at the base in question at the time of the attack? Such analysis seems beyond the scope and comprehension of the American fourth estate. Instead, media outlets like CNN embrace at face value anything they are told by official American sources, including a particularly preposterous insinuation that Russia actually colluded in the chemical weapons attack; the aforementioned presence of Russian officers at Al Shayrat air base has been cited as evidence that Russia had to have known about Syria\u2019s chemical warfare capability, and yet did nothing to prevent the attack. To sustain this illogic, the American public and decision-makers make use of a sophisticated propaganda campaign involving video images and narratives provided by forces opposed to the regime of Bashar al-Assad, including organizations like the \u201cWhite Helmets,\u201d the Syrian-American Medical Society, the Aleppo Media Center, which have a history of providing slanted information designed to promote an anti-Assad message (Donald Trump has all but acknowledged that these images played a major role in his decision to reevaluate his opinion of Bashar al-Assad and order the cruise missile attack on Al Shayrat airbase.) Many of the fighters affiliated with Tahrir al-Sham are veterans of the battle for Aleppo, and as such are intimately familiar with the tools and trade of the extensive propaganda battle that was waged simultaneously with the actual fighting in an effort to sway western public opinion toward adopting a more aggressive stance in opposition to the Syrian government of Assad. These tools were brought to bear in promoting a counter-narrative about the Khan Sheikhoun chemical incident (ironically, many of the activists in question, including the \u201cWhite Helmets,\u201d were trained and equipped in social media manipulation tactics using money provided by the United States; that these techniques would end up being used to manipulate an American President into carrying out an act of war most likely never factored into the thinking of the State Department personnel who conceived and implemented the program). Even slick media training, however, cannot gloss over basic factual inconsistencies. Early on, the anti-Assad opposition media outlets were labeling the Khan Sheikhoun incident as a \u201cSarin nerve agent\u201d attack; one doctor affiliated with Al Qaeda sent out images and commentary via social media that documented symptoms, such as dilated pupils, that he diagnosed as stemming from exposure to Sarin nerve agent. Sarin, however, is an odorless, colorless material, dispersed as either a liquid or vapor; eyewitnesses speak of a \u201cpungent odor\u201d and \u201cblue-yellow\u201d clouds, more indicative of chlorine gas. And while American media outlets, such as CNN, have spoken of munitions \u201cfilled to the brim\u201d with Sarin nerve agent being used at Khan Sheikhoun, there is simply no evidence cited by any source that can sustain such an account. Heartbreaking images of victims being treated by \u201cWhite Helmet\u201d rescuers have been cited as proof of Sarin-like symptoms, the medical viability of these images is in question; there are no images taken of victims at the scene of the attack. Instead, the video provided by the \u201cWhite Helmets\u201d is of decontamination and treatment carried out at a \u201cWhite Helmet\u201d base after the victims, either dead or injured, were transported there. The lack of viable protective clothing worn by the \u201cWhite Helmet\u201d personnel while handling victims is another indication that the chemical in question was not military grade Sarin; if it were, the rescuers would themselves have become victims (some accounts speak of just this phenomena, but this occurred at the site of the attack, where the rescuers were overcome by a \u201cpungent smelling\u201d chemical \u2013 again, Sarin is odorless.) More than 20 victims of the Khan Sheikhoun incident were transported to Turkish hospitals for care; three subsequently died. According to the Turkish Justice Minister, autopsies conducted on the bodies confirm that the cause of death was exposure to chemical agents. The World Health Organization has indicated that the symptoms of the Khan Sheikhoun victims are consistent with both Sarin and Chlorine exposure. American media outlets have latched onto the Turkish and WHO statements as \u201cproof\u201d of Syrian government involvement; however, any exposure to the chlorine/white phosphorous blend associated with Al Nusra chemical weapons would produce similar symptoms. Moreover, if Al Nusra was replicating the type of low-grade Sarin it employed at Ghouta in 2013 at Khan Sheikhoun, it is highly likely that some of the victims in question would exhibit Sarin-like symptoms. Blood samples taken from the victims could provide a more precise readout of the specific chemical exposure involved; such samples have allegedly been collected by Al Nusra-affiliated personnel, and turned over to international investigators (the notion that any serious investigatory body would allow Al Nusra to provide forensic evidence in support of an investigation where it is one of only two potential culprits is mindboggling, but that is precisely what has happened). But the Trump administration chose to act before these samples could be processed, perhaps afraid that their results would not sustain the underlying allegation of the employment of Sarin by the Syrian air force. Mainstream American media outlets have willingly and openly embraced a narrative provided by Al Qaeda affiliates whose record of using chemical weapons in Syria and distorting and manufacturing \u201cevidence\u201d to promote anti-Assad policies in the west, including regime change, is well documented. These outlets have made a deliberate decision to endorse the view of Al Qaeda over a narrative provided by Russian and Syrian government authorities without any effort to fact check either position. These actions, however, do not seem to shock the conscience of the American public; when it comes to Syria, the mainstream American media and its audience has long ago ceded the narrative to Al Qaeda and other Islamist anti-regime elements. The real culprits here are the Trump administration, and President Trump himself. The president\u2019s record of placing more weight on what he sees on television than the intelligence briefings he may or may not be getting, and his lack of intellectual curiosity and unfamiliarity with the nuances and complexities of both foreign and national security policy, created the conditions where the imagery of the Khan Sheikhoun victims that had been disseminated by pro-Al Nusra (i.e., Al Qaeda) outlets could influence critical life-or-death decisions. That President Trump could be susceptible to such obvious manipulation is not surprising, given his predilection for counter-punching on Twitter for any perceived slight; that his national security team allowed him to be manipulated thus, and did nothing to sway Trump\u2019s opinion or forestall action pending a thorough review of the facts, is scandalous. History will show that Donald Trump, his advisors and the American media were little more than willing dupes for Al Qaeda and its affiliates, whose manipulation of the Syrian narrative resulted in a major policy shift that furthers their objectives. The other winner in this sorry story is ISIS, which took advantage of the American strike against Al Shayrat to launch a major offensive against Syrian government forces around the city of Palmyra (Al Shayrat had served as the principal air base for operations in the Palmyra region). The breakdown in relations between Russia and the United States means that, for the foreseeable future at least, the kind of coordination that had been taking place in the fight against ISIS is a thing of the past, a fact that can only bode well for the fighters of ISIS. For a man who placed so much emphasis on defeating ISIS, President Trump\u2019s actions can only be viewed as a self-inflicted wound, a kind of circular firing squad that marks the actions of a Keystone Cop, and not the Commander in Chief of the most powerful nation in the world. But the person who might get the last laugh is President Assad himself. While the Pentagon has claimed that it significantly degraded the Al Shayrat air base, with 58 of 59 cruise missile hitting their targets, Russia has stated that only 23 cruise missiles impacted the facility, and these did only limited damage. The runway was undamaged; indeed, in the afternoon of April 7, 2017, a Syrian air force fighter-bomber took off from Al Shayrat , flew to Idlib Province, where it attacked Al Nusra positions near Khan Sheikhoun.

Another rail link between Birol and Radhikapur was announced for goods trains. KOLKATA-KHULNA-DHAKA ROUTE: 10 POINTS Narendra Modi and Sheikh Hasina flagged off the trial run of the Kolkata-Khulna train through video-conference. The train service has been named as Maitree Express-II. The Maitree Express-II will travel a total distance of about 176 km, 80 km of which is in India while the rest 96 km stretch falls in Bangladesh. The train will pass through Petrapole - the last station on the Indian side of the border - and Benapole - the first station on the Bangladesh side. (Photo: @RailMinIndia) The trial run train rolled from the Khulna railway station at 8 in the morning yesterday and entered India at around 1.40 in the afternoon. A 43-member Bangladeshi delegation was aboard the train. A regular Kolkata-Khulna train service is likely to be available from July. The two sides of erstwhile united Bengal were connected through train service before the partition of India in 1947. Train service was available from Sealdah to Khulna and Jessore. The train service was suspended during the 1965 India-Pakistan war. Bangladesh was then part of Pakistan as East Pakistan. The War of Liberation in 1971 gave birth to Bangladesh. The train service started between India and Bangladesh in 2008 when Maitree Express-I was launched.

Through Khulna route, one can now reach Dhaka from Kolkata in 13 hours. It will take seven hours to reach Khulna from Kolkata. Bus services are already operational on Kolkata-Dhaka-Agartala and Kolkata-Dhaka routes. The Kolkata-Dhaka route was launched in 1999. The Kolkata-Dhaka-Agartala route was opened in 2015.

It is also the birthplace of Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who was born there in 1947. Buses will depart on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from Kolkata while on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays from Dhaka. The regular bus service on Kolkata-Khulna-Dhaka route is likely to be available from June. The West Bengal Transport Corporation will run the service on Indian side while the Bangladesh Road Transport Corporation will handle the project on the other side.

The incident happened at Chandausi in Sambhal district on Saturday. Hearing girl's screams, neighbours rushed to her aid, nabbed the accused and handed him over the police. They rushed the girl to hospital.\nPolice have booked the boy under POCSO Act and have sent him to jail. Noticeably, it is the second incident of sexual assault on a child in a month in the district.\nSuperintendent of police Ravi Shankar Chavi told TOI over the phone, \"The boy lives in the neighbourhood and both his family and the child's know each other. When he took the girl with him, it did not arouse any suspicion.\"\nSurendra Singh Yadav , station officer of Chandausi police station under which the village where the incident took place falls, told TOI, \"The accused is an unletterd 12-year-old. His parents are labourers while he sits idle all day long. As the boy is a minor, we cannot interrogate him beyond a point. But he may have fallen into bad company.\"\nPolice said the boy took the girl home on the pretext of giving her buttermilk when no one was at home. There, he allegedly raped her.

Her thesis is simple enough: At some point, feminism lost its political moorings; it became vapid and toothless in its quest for universality. Feminism became a catch-all term for self-empowerment, for individual achievement. Feminists, she believes, forsook their values for the sake of assimilation, which is another way of saying they were co-opted by the system they once rejected. \u201cIf you have women in positions of power behaving like men do,\u201d Crispin says, \u201cthat is not a defeat of the patriarchy. \u2026 That\u2019s just patriarchy with women in it.\u201d A feminist politics is, according to Crispin, necessarily anti-capitalist. Patriarchy is bound up with capitalism, and thus the two must fall together. She\u2019s not the first person to criticize feminism in this way. Socialist feminists have long argued that feminism demands the dismantling of capitalism. Crispin\u2019s rejection of universalism and individualism, though, feels somewhat new, or at least it\u2019s stated in more urgent terms. In this interview, Crispin and I discuss her contempt for consumerist culture, which she says has pervaded feminist ideology and poisoned its roots. Since she considers patriarchy and capitalism as features of the same system, I ask her if feminism, rightly understood, is a revolutionary project. This conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Sean Illing Your book reads like an indictment of our entire culture. Is that the spirit in which you wrote it? Jessa Crispin That\u2019s right. I think part of it was feminism used to be outside the culture. It used to be a way of criticizing the culture. It used to be a way of imagining a different kind of culture. But somehow in the last 10 years or so, feminism became another part of the culture; it became as vapid and selfish as everything else. Sean Illing In many ways \u2014 and this is part of the argument you make in the book \u2014 feminism became apolitical, or divorced from its political roots. Jessa Crispin Yeah, and that was really frustrating as someone who became politically conscious through my engagement with feminism. It was disappointing to see feminists abandon their value system for the sake of assimilation and power. It was deeply, deeply disappointing to watch. Sean Illing So let\u2019s talk about those forgotten values and what replaced them. When you object to new feminism, what are you objecting to exactly? Jessa Crispin I\u2019m objecting to feminism as it currently exists in the mainstream. Certainly there is a tradition of radical feminism. There are still people working within radical feminism, but they are not the people who are being allowed to speak for feminism. When anybody is asked to write an op-ed in the New York Times or the Washington Post or whatever, it's not coming from a radical political awareness. It's coming from this very mainstream feminism and they're taking up all of the space. So the conversation has been co-opted by people who have no idea what they're talking about. It's about personal essays. It's about what's a good television show. It has nothing to do with how do we actually improve the lives of all women, not just women in New York City, not just young, pretty, not just mediagenic women. Sean Illing But you go much further than that in the book, right? It\u2019s not just that feminism has been co-opted or defanged \u2014 you say that it\u2019s now doing the work of patriarchy. Jessa Crispin This idea emerged that if we just put a lot more women in positions of power, somehow that would defeat the patriarchy, not understanding that the patriarchy has nothing to do with men. If women in power behave like men do, that is not a defeat of the patriarchy. That's just patriarchy with women in it. And patriarchy is one of those really dissatisfying words because everybody uses it and there's not a general understanding, a shared understanding of what the word means other than anything that is keeping you down. Sean Illing How do you define patriarchy? Jessa Crispin My working definition of patriarchy is a society that's structured by hierarchy. So unless that is reformed, unless we reform society so there are no hierarchies, because the hierarchy used to be white, property-owning men at the top of the hierarchy and everybody else in varying positions underneath that, and now it's just money and power. So women can easily attain a high position on the hierarchy, but that's not the end of patriarchy. Unless we get rid of the hierarchy and stop structuring our society around it, the patriarchy is not defeated. Sean Illing It seems to me that you\u2019re making an argument against capitalism as such, or the values that undergird capitalism. If we replace \u201cpatriarchy\u201d with \u201ccapitalism\u201d does your analysis change at all? Jessa Crispin No, but this isn\u2019t new. Second-wave feminism, even first-wave feminism, noticed that patriarchy was intertwined with capitalism. So there isn't a way of defeating one without the other. And also capitalism is also one of those words, like patriarchy, that everybody uses these days without a full understanding of what the word means. I\u2019m probably guilty of that, too. Some of my philosopher friends say that I occasionally misuse the word, but I try not to. The point is that patriarchy and capitalism are of the same system. They support one another and one cannot be removed without the other. Sean Illing So you see feminism as a casualty of capitalist or patriarchal culture insofar as women have internalized these values and come to define their success in these terms? Jessa Crispin Yes, and that's a problem for almost any marginalized group when assimilation becomes the goal. It's much easier to criticize corporate culture when you're not allowed to be in the higher levels of corporate culture. As soon as you're allowed to be a CEO of a large company, then it's like, \"Oh, we'll just reform it from within. We don't have to destroy it. Now that I'm running it, it's fine. So it is a kind of abandoning of principles because power feels really good. And as long as the system is in place, and as long as women are benefitting from that system, it's going to be harder to have these conversations. The better women do, the less likely we are to have these conversations under the guise of feminism. Sean Illing You say that men are women\u2019s responsibility but not their problem. What do you mean? Jessa Crispin Well, every woman who ever writes about feminism immediately get a lot of emails or tweets or Facebook messages from men saying: Teach me about feminism, tell me what you mean, explain this to me. The thing is, feminism has been around for a while, it's in the culture, it's in the conversation. If men still need to learn about feminism, if they still need to be introduced to it, it's disingenuous. All they're trying to do is be parasites or they're just trying to cast themselves as the good guys, so they don't have to question their own behavior or thought processes. Men are women's responsibility because women are roughly 100 years ahead of men in terms of questioning gender and going along with the project of androgyny and getting in touch with the masculine side of themselves, which men have not done. They've not explored androgyny outside of the queer communities. They haven\u2019t developed feminine values. They've not done the writing, the research, or the work. So men are our responsibility because we\u2019re so far ahead of them on this path. We can\u2019t drag them into becoming better humans \u2014 that\u2019s their job. But we also can\u2019t meddle with or get in the way of it, and I think they\u2019re are responsibility in that sense. Author Jessa Crispin. Sean Illing Let\u2019s circle back to the political content of feminism. Your case for radicalism involves a philosophical critique of universalism. For a movement to have universal appeal, you argue, it has to become banal or toothless. So my question is: What's the right tension between popular appeal and marginalization, between pragmatism and impurity? How do you strike that balance? Jessa Crispin There has always been a radical edge to feminism \u2014 that\u2019s where all the progress originates from. It originates from women questioning the validity of marriage. It comes from women throwing bombs and starving themselves and being tortured by the police. It comes from this dedication and clarity of vision, and that has been removed from contemporary feminism. It's not supported and it's not taken seriously. Now what's taken seriously are moves toward assimilation and universality, so this idea that every woman should be a feminist, I don't actually agree with because not every woman needs to be on the streets, not every woman needs to put her body on the line. If you look at the radical thinkers of the second wave like Dworkin and Firestone and Angela Davis and bell hooks, if you look at the relationship between that and the mainstream women's culture, even if it's under the name of feminists like Gloria Steinem, it\u2019s the radicals that drag a reluctant mainstream culture into an awareness of what they're doing. Mainstream feminism is bland; it\u2019s the \u201cyou go girl\u201d self-empowerment version of feminism, which has nothing to do with progress. Sean Illing So is any nonradical form of feminism politically impotent? Jessa Crispin Not impotent. I got into this argument with a friend of mine about my book because his view on things is that progress is made through participation, that you participate in a system that you're trying to reform. My viewpoint is you don't participate; you abstain. Take marriage, for example. Marriage is a patriarchal institution. Historically, it's about treating women as property and there are people who believe that the way to reform marriage or to reform heterosexual relationships or committed monogamous relationships, homosexual or heterosexual, is by being married and sort of renegotiating that on the level of the couple, rather than advocating for the abolishment of marriage. Do I think that nobody should ever get married or nobody should ever be part of a monogamous couple? No. Do I think that I'm never going to get married because I politically believe that's the right decision to make because of the history it has? Yes. But hopefully between those two approaches we can reform marriage so that benefits are not passed through the couple as far as health insurance, estate planning, that sort of stuff goes, that that's allowed for people who aren't married. So both things are important, but if there's not the radical person from the outside throwing bombs and rocks at the center, then it becomes unquestioned. It becomes stagnant. In feminism, there are very few people who are from the margins who are given a meaningful platform. Sean Illing In the book, you describe your feminism as a \u201ccleansing fire.\u201d What are you setting fire to and what are you replacing it with? Jessa Crispin I'd like to set fire to patriarchal religions, to the idea of male God. In short, everything. But what do you replace it with? On the left, there are very few theories about different ways our society can be structured, different ways we organize our lives, different value systems we can take on instead of the ones that we have absorbed from the mainstream culture. What we\u2019re left with is apocalyptic fears about the end of the world. All of our movies are about cataclysms \u2014 earthquakes or sentient machines coming from other planets to destroy us. There's very little attention paid to what we can do, because everything looks like we're crashing into the sun \u2014 economic devastation, environmental devastation, etc. Everything seems so overwhelming that we just sort of amuse ourselves by imagining the end of the world and entertaining ourselves with the thought of it. In my other writing, one of the complaints that I've been getting is I didn't tell women what they should do, that I didn't give some sort of plan for action. One of the reasons I didn't do that, other than just to say we need to realign our values and live a life within those values, is that there's not one thing. Everything has to be reimagined. The world is bad. It does seem to be at one of these crisis points where so many different things are wrong that it's impossible to try and imagine something different. So just to live a life of integrity and try a new way of being is the important work. There's no one topic. There's no one area. It's everything. Sean Illing Basically, you\u2019re calling for a total revolution. Jessa Crispin I don't see how we're going to survive without one. Sean Illing There\u2019s no revolution without solidarity, and that\u2019s something you lament in the book. There should be more solidarity between feminists and other groups who feel marginalized, but our society is too atomized for that. Jessa Crispin A lot of the social justice movements are atomized: There\u2019s too much competition, too much in-fighting. The goal should be the removal of the system, the total reform or destruction of the system, because we have a shared oppression by it. Then we can see what should be a shared solidarity. I was recently talking to a feminist who was surprised to find herself agreeing with the pope, because she thought of herself as an ideological enemy of the pope. But my response was: We share some values with Catholicism, with religion. We can\u2019t say that because someone doesn\u2019t agree with us about abortion, we should just reject our commonalities. If we have to share all of our values before we can work together, we\u2019ll never work together. We have to find common ground where we can.

Now 7.5 years after its premiere, the original faces of the show--Hina Khan and Karan Mehra--are nowhere in the picture, yet the show is creating magic like never before. The average urban impressions of the show (according to BARC India) for the past 5 weeks is 7 million, which is a huge number (Week 13: 6.6 million, Week 12: 7.2 million, Week 10: 6.7 million, Week 9: 7.1 million). The show has been managing a place in Top 3 since a couple of weeks now. \nYeh Rishta... that premiered in January 2009 on Star Plus, captured the imagination of the viewers instantly. The show revolved around Akshara and Naitik, who fell in love over the period of time after their wedding, as theirs was an arranged marriage. The focus shifted to their kids--Naira and Naksh only recently, after a generation leap. It is said that Akshara avoided ageing on the screen for the longest time. And when she did eventually, she opted out of the show soon after. YRKKH fans couldn't have imagined the show without Akshara, but interestingly the show's ratings got a boost post the character's death. \nAlso read: Yeh Rishta Kya Kehlata Hai actress Shivangi Joshi: My real wedding will take time \nBetween September 2016-November 2016, the 9-week ratings of the show averaged 4.9 million impressions, according to BARC India. (Week 45: 4697, Week 44: 4494, Week 43: 5069, Week 42: 5244, Week 41: 5509, Week 40: 4848, Week 39: 4353, Week 38: 4704, Week 37: 5213). Akshara's death track around December revived the show's ratings for a while, but the best was yet to come. \nPost Akshara's death, the makers focussed on the love story of the new generation (Naira and Kartik) and the ratings started to soar, till it started averaging 7 million. \nAnd this is why the makers should not stop experimenting.

And I realized that if you remain silent, you are still going to be terrorized. So speaking out, you can help people.\u201d\nWhile recovering from the Taliban attack, she realized that \u201cextremists tried everything to stop me [and the fact that they didn\u2019t] is clear evidence that no one can stop me. I have second life for the purpose of [pressing for] education and I\u2019ll continue working on [this issue].\nMs. Yousafazi went on to say that brothers and fathers must also support women and girls in the global effort to ensure education for all and, more importantly, to \u201cbe who they want to be.\u201d Indeed, she said that her father always told people not to ask him what he did for Malala, \u2018but ask what I didn\u2019t do \u2013 I didn\u2019t clip her wings.\u2019\nSumming up the conversation, Mr. Guterrers called Ms. Yousafzai\u2019s life \u201ca remarkable example of solidarity.\u201d Yet, he said, Pakistan is also such an example. \u201cWe live in a world where so many borders are closed; so many doors are closed, but Pakistan has received seven million refugees with open borders, open doors and hearts \u2013 a symbol of generosity.\u201d\nHe hoped this spirit could serve as an example that \u201cit is not by closing doors that we will all be able to move forward.\u201d", "highlightTitle": "", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.p7.m3m26NPtToE01xfApphof4DvKKHR19WchWXMhGLwhTkDWAzkJ9J0hOCt6P_wo-", "title": "Malala Yousafzai designated youngest-ever UN Messenger of Peace", "ord_in_thread": 0, "uuid": "1b73a4f1f753faae81409b24f9220278747e5fa0", "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-11T08:29:44.783+03:00"}, {"highlightText": "", "author": "Kenia Calderon", "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "thread": {"site_type": "news", "published": "2017-04-09T06:14:00.000+03:00", "performance_score": 9, "spam_score": 0.0, "uuid": "844494927e2b57d097121efcc7fb32a3edcbc85f", "country": "US", "replies_count": 0, "title": "To My Undocumented Friend, You Are Here To Stay", "domain_rank": 139, "site_categories": ["news", "education"], "main_image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/58e9609b1600002a004d97ed.jpg", "participants_count": 1, "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 996, "likes": 996}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "site": "huffingtonpost.com", "section_title": "Latino Voices Blog on The Huffington Post", "site_full": "www.huffingtonpost.com", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOjRMtfdbIjvYpC42HkuzEIwmuQ2LEYNUMX7QjieujuIs9ie6awyKlrMc1G6ecCZSWBb1ef_EJqWjQyhEwxGRZrP", "site_section": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/feeds/verticals/latino-voices/blog.xml", "title_full": "To My Undocumented Friend, You Are Here To Stay"}, "external_links": [], "language": "english", "published": "2017-04-09T06:14:00.000+03:00", "text": "To My Undocumented Friend, You Are Here To Stay Someday, we will no longer need to validate our own existence in this nation we built. 04/08/2017 06:14   \nYou, my undocumented friend, are important.

Guy wins Rs 1 crore for making digital transaction In the consumer section, the first mega prize of Rs 1 crore went to a customer of Central Bank of India, while the second prize of Rs 50 lakh went to a Bank of Baroda customer. By: PTI | New Delhi | Updated: April 10, 2017 1:23 pm During the quarter, gross non-performing assets (NPAs) doubled to 13.7 per cent as against 6.56 per cent in the same period of the previous fiscal. \nA transaction of Rs 1,590 has bagged a Central Bank of India customer lucky bounty of Rs 1 crore under the government\u2019s promotional scheme to popularise digital payments. \nPresident Pranab Mukherjee picked up the lucky winners from the 100th draw of lots under digital payments promotion schemes at Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi. He congratulated the six winners \u2014 three consumers and three merchants \u2014 of Lucky Grahak Yojana and Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojana. \nIn the consumer section, the first mega prize of Rs 1 crore went to a customer of Central Bank of India, while the second prize of Rs 50 lakh went to a Bank of Baroda customer. A customer of Punjab National Bank is the winner of third prize of Rs 25 lakh. \nAll the three customers had done transactions using their RuPay debit cards. The names of three winners were not yet known as the draw only displayed their transaction numbers. These will be matched with card details to identify the winners. Three merchants also won prizes of Rs 50 lakh, Rs 25 lakh and Rs 12 lakh, respectively. \nThe winners will be felicitated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 14 at Nagpur on the occasion of Ambedkar Jayanti. \nFollowing demonetisation of old Rs 500/1000 notes on November 9 last year, the government took a slew of measures to promote digital payments in the country. \nThe government launched the Lucky Grahak Yojana for consumers and Digi Dhan Vyapar Yojana for merchants on December 25, 2016 to promote digital transactions. These schemes are being implemented by the National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI). \nIn his address, Mukherjee asked citizens to extend their unstinted support to the mission of a less-cash India. \n\u201cIndia has a long way to go to become a cash less society. The initiatives of the government are a good beginning and we need to sustain and nurture these with active participation from all segments of the society. \n\u201cIt is necessary to reduce cash in circulation and impart greater urgency to promoting secure digital payment methods to ensure greater transparency,\u201d the President said. \nPresently, India remain primarily a cash-based economy with about 95 per cent of the personal consumption and 86 per cent of all transactions being in cash. \n\u201cAll efforts of the government will achieve their end only if people were to adopt them proactively,\u201d he said, as he complemented the government on its \u201cbold initiatives\u201d for promoting the culture of digital payments. Stressing that India is on the cusp of a digital revolution, Mukherjee noted more than one billion Indians have a unique identity number with a biometric identifier which is unique in its own way. \n\u201cEven countries which are technologically far more advanced than India with comparatively much smaller size population do not have such a system in place. The Aadhaar card initiative is a watershed event in the development story of India,\u201d he said. \nSpeaking on the occasion, Cabinet Secretary P K Sinha said, \u201cI would like reiterate our resolve and committement to take India towards digital economy.

During his visit, the President will witness the signing of the MOUs between Peza and the foreign investors. \nThe investment promotion agency\u2019s foray in the Middle East comes as Plaza targets to \u201ctriple or quadruple\u201d investment pledges this year following a 26-percent decline in commitments in 2016 to P218 billion from P295 billion in 2015. \nThe pledges from Middle Eastern companies are expected to create a total of 21,170 jobs once these projects start operations here in the Philippines. Plaza deferred from naming the specific companies before the actual signing of the MOU this week. \nWhen broken down, it would show that the bulk of the pledges will come from Saudi Arabia, accounting for a combined $465.34 million. These are commitments for a total of seven projects, which, once in operation, will generate 15,770 jobs. \nQatar, on the other hand, will commit $175 million involving 10 projects that will bring new jobs to 4,400 people. Only one project is from UAE, promising $10 million worth of pledges that will create a thousand jobs.

Beating Retreat \nThe Allies suffered 159,000 casualties, including 46,000 Scots, during the offensive. \nThe moderator of the Church of Scotland will conduct a service at Faubourg d'Amiens Commonwealth War Graves Cemetery in Arras while the Royal Regiment of Scotland band will conduct a Beating Retreat in the Place des Heros. \nIn Edinburgh, a service will take place in the Scottish National War Memorial, followed by a Beating Retreat by the HM Royal Marines Scotland band on Edinburgh Castle Esplanade.

'Bad trenches' \nHe joined up, despite being exempt because of his occupation as a farmhand. \nHe later sent postcards home of quaint French villages with their names blacked out so they could not be used by the enemy to target troops. Image caption Margaret Barr holds a photo of her great uncle David Wyllie who died in battle \nThe only hint of the terrible conditions he experienced was a line in a letter that said he had just been in \"bad weather and bad trenches, so we had anything but a pleasant time of it.\" \nAnd replying to a letter saying the family now had two cars, he said: \"I would not mind if I was at home again having a run around in them.\" He was killed not long after sending that letter. \nMrs Barr still has the telegram that was sent to David Wyllie's father informing him of his son's death. 'Emotional day' \nSpeaking ahead of the ceremony in France, she said: \"It's a huge privilege to go out to Arras and represent the family, and to lay a wreath. It will be quite poignant.

The industry owes much credit to Mohanlal, whose Oppam, Pulimurugan and ?Munthirivallikal Thalirkkumbol were highly successful at the box office. Is that the reason why Mohanlal has tried and tested the same formula in this period war film too? \n1971 Beyond Borders Cast: Mohanlal, Allu Sirish, Asha Sarath and Arunoday Singh \n1971 Beyond Borders Director: Major Ravi \n1971 Beyond Borders Rating: (2/5) \nInspired by true events in the lives of Param Vir Chakra recipients, 1971 Beyond Borders takes us back in time and depicts the warfare between India and Pakistan in 1971. In the beginning, we see Colonel Mahadevan (Mohanlal) rescuing the life of a Pakistani commander and his team during a UN mission. When Mahadevan asks the commander if his team is hurt, the latter smirks. He says it's surprising to see it coming from an 'Indian' soldier. To this, Mahadevan explains the rationale behind warfare and that soldiers are but humans off the battlefield. We come to know about the commander's story, who says he's the son of Lieutenant colonel Muhammed Akhram Raja (Arunoday Singh). A predictable twist follows. Mahadevan reveals that it was his father retired Brigadier Sahadevan (also played by Mohanlal), who killed Raja. \nSahadevan's grandchildren innocently ask him the reason behind respecting a martyr Raja, that too a Pakistani. Because he's our enemy right? \nSahadevan chuckles and narrates the Indo-Pak war of 1971, the emotions of army men and their families. Any film is a reflection of the director's self. 1971 Beyond Borders is directed by Major Ravi. So, it shouldn't come as a surprise that the core is all about being patriotic. The premise of the film is war, but very little attention is given to it, even on paper. \nFor instance, there's a scene where the entire troop of soldiers bounce off the walls when letters from their respective families arrive. The director moves the camera slowly to each soldier with a voice-over of their relatives. This scene works in particular. For a war film, emotions of the soldiers should have formed the cornerstone. But they did not. Instead, we get to see a strict officer giving a rabble-rousing speech, which, works in parts. The film veers between a war film and a documentary drama. By the way, Allu Sirish plays a brief role as Lieutenant Chinmay. Again, a misfit. \nApart from the war sequence, there's a scene involving battle tanks which is laughable. Nobody better than Ravi could pin down the details of a battlefield. That said, his narration, as a filmmaker, is a dud. \nAt 57, what's amusing about Mohanlal is the intensity with which he emotes in every scene, be it romance or comedy. However, filmmakers have failed to feed the tiger with a solid meat. For the same, 1971 Beyond Borders tanks. \n( The writer tweets as @LoneWolf_7126 ) ", "highlightTitle": "", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxSMGMZ1VQHBYxz9LUzWKzkwGgmyHm_WkKPc_5OeNZx.yN63_oVw1upZkDHhwDTrkA8gEdSW2CS6shReSLk5dMm_K_V902QM4qLudjzSSTXBTvt3wHdHdydAFGiiBNy1aU-", "title": "1971 Beyond Borders movie review: Mohanlal's film is less cinema, more patriotism : Reviews, News - India Today", "ord_in_thread": 0, "uuid": "39dffb143d3f4c212d6a0b6f5dafec820b705cba", "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-09T11:15:40.728+03:00"}, {"highlightText": "", "author": "WILLIAM GRIMES", "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david peel", "sentiment": "positive"}, {"name": "corey kilgannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angel perez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "esther rosario", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david michael rosario", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldmine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ono", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lennon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peel", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenwich village", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zuccotti park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brooklyn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "midwood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alaska", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lower east side long", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "army", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "orange records", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "f.b.i.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple records", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "thread": {"site_type": "news", "published": "2017-04-10T04:26:32.514+03:00", "performance_score": 9, "spam_score": 0.0, "uuid": "2c77f5cb95a04b990f11e25d652fdf3ecc5ccc23", "country": "US", "replies_count": 0, "title": "David Peel, Downtown Singer and Marijuana Evangelist, Dies at 74", "domain_rank": 98, "site_categories": ["education"], "main_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/10/arts/10PEELobit-web-1/08PEELobit-web-1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "participants_count": 1, "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 999, "likes": 999}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 4}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}}, "site": "nytimes.com", "section_title": "NYT > Most Recent Headlines", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxTqL_zg0lpoQFQ79unlwe6wvVMt6H8oIn1oYACRoRmQzqLo7C4gEk92mZURADZojtS3kmPkU9SivoB928F1fkY6Wy0HWXtnlj", "site_section": "http://nytimes.com/timeswire/feeds/", "title_full": "David Peel, Downtown Singer and Marijuana Evangelist, Dies at 74"}, "external_links": [], "language": "english", "published": "2017-04-10T04:26:32.514+03:00", "text": "\u201cI Like Marijuana,\u201d with its happy, insistent refrain \u2014 \u201cI like marijuana, you like marijuana, we like marijuana too\u201d \u2014 became his signature. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story In 1971, Lennon and Ms. Ono stepped out of their limousine at the park, joined the audience being entertained by Mr. Peel and began singing along and clapping.

In Ottawa, the crowd stood largely silent for the opening of an overnight vigil, listening to choral music; watching musical performances, including by a young indigenous drummer; and quietly placing candles on the steps of the monument for each of the Canadians who died. Photo Boots were placed at the memorial in Vimy in remembrance of the Canadian soldiers who died there. Credit Gael Turine for The New York Times Although Canada entered World War I at its outset in 1914, Vimy was the first battle in which its divisions fought as a unified force and successfully broke down a German line that had defeated British and French forces. Over the past century, the fight, in which 7,000 Canadians were also wounded, has come to be viewed as the moment when Canada finally stood apart from Britain. In Quebec, Canada\u2019s involvement in World War I has always been a topic of controversy. Many of the French-speaking residents of the province were the leading opponents of the government\u2019s introduction of conscription in 1917. Riots erupted there in protest, and the move further eroded French-speaking Quebecers\u2019 support for the war. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Though the view that modern Canada was created out of the country\u2019s involvement in World War I is now widely held outside Quebec, a debate continues over the degree to which the sense of nationhood can be attributed to the Battle of Vimy Ridge. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIt\u2019s really something of a puzzle to me why Vimy has become this,\u201d said Margaret MacMillan, a Canadian professor of international history at the University of Oxford and the author of two diplomatic histories of World War I. \u201cI can\u2019t exactly explain why at certain times and moments in our history we focus on certain things from our past, but we certainly focus on Vimy.\u201d Vimy has endured as a symbol of Canada\u2019s role in the war partly because of the Canadian National Vimy Memorial on the battlefield. Despite being an ocean away, the memorial\u2019s two pylons have appeared on Canadian bank notes and are so well known that the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation used the monument\u2019s silhouette as the logo for its broadcast on the anniversary. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story After the war, France gave 100 hectares of the battlefield to Canada, and the Canadian government decided that the memorial would serve as the country\u2019s primary overseas monument to World War I, a struggle in which a country of just eight million people lost 66,000 soldiers. Its design was selected through a highly publicized competition. The result, unveiled in 1936, was also designated as the memorial to the 11,285 Canadians who died in France during the war but had no graves.

And I love this show. But I began to get worried about my capacity to deliver my best work. The schedule is very intense, and I began to wonder, how many different ways can I find to say, \u201cThe time vortex is going to open up and destroy the entire universe as we know it, unless we blow up that model spaceship over there\u201d? It concerned me that if I did more, yes, I\u2019d be able to do it, but I\u2019d just be phoning it in. And I didn\u2019t ever want to be in that situation. Photo The Doctor (Mr. Capaldi) encounters the Mondasian Cybermen, enemies from his past, on \u201cDoctor Who.\u201d Credit BBC America Now that you\u2019ve had nearly three seasons to play the character, what do you think distinguished your version of the Doctor? First and foremost, he\u2019s not human. So I think he struggles to create a version of himself that humans find easy to be around. He\u2019s always trying to save the universe, so if he upsets someone, that has to come with the territory. But then later on, he probably gets a bit worried and wishes he could go back and say, \u201cI\u2019m sorry I upset you.\u201d I like when he\u2019s strange. \nAdvertisement Was it your idea that he should also play the electric guitar ? We had just done my first season, and I made a little list of things that might be interesting to have a go at in the next season, and one of them was guitar playing. To my surprise, they went with it, in quite a big way. I\u2019d open a script, and it would say, \u201cThe Doctor is playing \u2018Amazing Grace,\u2019 Jimi Hendrix-style.\u201d I had a day where they said, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to go buy the Doctor\u2019s guitar.\u201d I thought he should have a Fender Stratocaster, but every time I tried one on, it looked like I was having a midlife crisis. And then we found this one Yamaha guitar, which was the one we ended up with, which looks like someone had described a Fender Stratocaster to somebody else, and made it without ever seeing a picture of it. Photo Mr. Capaldi, left, as the Doctor, with Pearl Mackie as his new companion, Bill Potts, on \u201cDoctor Who.\u201d Credit Simon Ridgway/BBC America What has it been like to work with Pearl Mackie, who plays Bill, the Doctor\u2019s new companion? My previous companion [Clara, played by Jenna Coleman] was someone who was really part of the \u201cDoctor Who\u201d world. Pearl\u2019s character, Bill, is someone from the real world, if you like, who has no understanding and no knowledge about Tardises and Daleks and monsters and all that stuff. She\u2019s just someone who has great potential, and the Doctor thinks that potential is not being realized, and decides it would be fun to help her. It\u2019s good, because Pearl is not particularly an expert on \u201cDoctor Who,\u201d so everything is new to her, as it was to her character. It meant that she wasn\u2019t bringing any baggage to it. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Is there a moment about your experience as the Doctor that you\u2019ll remember most? At the end of my first season, we did a sequence where the Cybermen emerge from St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral . We shot it on this most wonderful summer\u2019s day, a Saturday afternoon, and everywhere were these huge crowds gathered around us, waiting for the Cybermen. I love stuff like that. I would go into work on days that I wasn\u2019t scheduled to work, if there was something I thought was interesting. If the Daleks attacked a space station, well, I had to go in and see that. The only other choice is to go: \u201cOh, I\u2019ll go home now. I\u2019m tired.\u201d It\u2019s like being a little kid, you know? Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Bollywood\u2019s bubbly girl, Parineeti Chopra, is not bubbly anymore. The actress has gone through drastic transformations to shed her chubby look and join the gang of sultry actresses. Parineeti in her By Akshata Shetty | Published: April 9, 2017 9:14 AM IST Parineeti Chopra hot and sexy pictures! \nBollywood\u2019s bubbly girl, Parineeti Chopra , is not bubbly anymore. The actress has gone through drastic transformations to shed her chubby look and join the gang of sultry actresses. Parineeti in her upcoming film, Meri Pyaari Bindu , has revealed a new side of her. Well, we are not just talking about her chiseled looks but also her singing skills. The actress is following her sister Priyanka Chopra \u2019s way and has lent her voice for her next. Her debut song Mana Ke Hum Yaar Nahin has gained a lot of momentum and she has garnered a lot of appreciation for her singing skills too. \nNow that Parineeti can sing too its bound that she will be compared with her contemporaries like Alia Bhatt and Shraddha Kapoor , who are both actor-cum-singers already. When asked is Parineeti fears these comparisons affecting her image, the actress says that she never had this thought in mind before she decided to take up singing. She also silently mocks the actresses for using autotune in their songs to sound perfect. Parineeti makes it clear how she is different from Alia and Shraddha is the most decent way ever.

I am so obsessed with music in life. When I was at that recording studio behind that mic, I was just thinking about me singing. And I just wanted to sing as technically sound as it could be. I didn\u2019t want any autotune. What you hear in the song is my take. Nothing has been \u2018fixed.\u2019 And I\u2019m proud of the fact that it wasn\u2019t required because I have learnt music. Using autotune would have been a slap on my music education.\u201d (ALSO READ: Meri Pyaari Bindu Chapter 4: When Bindu tries to shock and scandalize Ayushmann Khurrana\u2019s mother! ) \nParineeti\u2019s cousin Priyanka Chopra is an international fame now.

But even with his proven treaded-tyre credentials , not even he expected to make up quite so many places on a damp (if not fully wet) opening lap in Shanghai. \nLooking at the video above, you can see that the young Dutchman cannily selected second gear for the start - a bold, wheelspin-limiting decision that enabled him to rocket away from his P16 grid slot. \nOnce underway, Verstappen picked off Carlos Sainz\u2019s struggling slick-shod Toro Rosso almost immediately, and followed that up with passes on Kevin Magnussen\u2019s Haas, Marcus Ericsson\u2019s Sauber and McLaren's Stoffel Vandoorne to be P13 through the opening two turns. \nSergio Perez\u2019s Force India was then dispatched around the outside through Turn 4 before the 19-year-old raced past Lance Stroll\u2019s Williams under braking for Turn 6 to take tenth. \nShowing an incredible confidence that belied the tricky conditions, Verstappen then used a wider line through Turn 8 to snatch P9 from no less a driver than Fernando Alonso, before sending one up the inside of the similarly experienced Felipe Massa into Turn 11 to take eighth. \nThe astonishing nine-place opening lap climb was then completed when Nico Hulkenberg\u2019s Renault peeled into the pits, gifting Verstappen another place. \n\u201cIn the wet it\u2019s easier to overtake,\u201d F1's youngest ever winner said nonchalantly afterwards. \u201cI think it was a perfect race for me because then after [conditions improve] you go on the slick tyres, and you have passed most of the field already and you are basically back in the position where you should be.\u201d \nAnd if not for the damp conditions at the start, where might he have finished? \n\u201cWell, not third, for sure. Maybe sixth? [They were] good conditions for me\u2026\u201d \nFor more onboard videos from Shanghai, including several unseen angles, stay tuned to Formula1.com on Tuesday.

If this sounds familiar, you\u2019re not alone: There\u2019s a scientific name for this scenario. \nHAFE stands for High Altitude Flatus Expulsion. Coined by a pair of researchers in the 1980s, the \u201ctongue-in-cheek\u201d term describes a phenomenon observed when mountain climbers experienced flatulence at high altitudes, said Dr. David Shlim , a physician and former president of the International Society of Travel Medicine. \nTurns out HAFE is likely at play when you pass more gas on a plane. Ivan Hafizov via Getty Images \nAirplane cabins are pressurized to between 6,000 and 8,000 feet , which is a significant altitude change for your body if you\u2019ve come from sea level, Shlim told HuffPost. And just as the air in your water bottle expands at higher altitudes, the gas in your intestines can expand on a plane, growing to take up about 30 percent more room than usual. \nThen, it needs to escape. \u201cThe air pressure in an airplane is different than on the ground,\u201d said Dr. Scott Kalish , a travel medicine doctor in New York City. \u201cIn certain people, it can predispose them to developing more gas.\u201d \nExpanding gas can also lead to feelings of bloat, Kalish says, though he said he doesn\u2019t hear that complaint often. If feeling gassy or bloated is an in-flight problem for you, there are ways to help prevent it. Drinking water is always a good idea, especially when you\u2019re flying, and avoiding salty and fatty foods helps combat bloating. Dr. Marvin Cooper , a travel medicine physician in Manhattan, recommends walking around the plane to \u201cshake up your bowels a bit,\u201d he told HuffPost. Kalish says an over-the-counter anti-gas medication should ease discomfort, too. Oh, and let your farts out , even if it\u2019s awkward. In a 2013 paper on in-flight flatulence , researchers from the University of Copenhagen noted that holding back a fart can lead to discomfort, pain and more bloating. Over time, the habit could also increase your risk of colonic diverticular disease , an inflammation of the colon. Bottom line: Let your farts fly when you do, and all will be fine.

Image caption The drink has been made by the Benedictine monks of Buckfast Abbey in Devon since the 1920s and a new winery was built in 2011 Buckfast wine In the 1920s Benedictine brothers developed tonic wine sold from the abbey The base wine was first imported from Spain, and nowadays from France Ingredients include red wine, phosphates, caffeine and vanillin In 1927, distribution and sales were passed to J Chandler in Andover, Hampshire In 2011, a new winery was completed at the abbey. The site has four vats, each holding 130,000 litres of wine \nIts vice president Alistair McBay said: \"The monks should be setting an example as a religious organisation but the opposite is happening.\" \n\"The question needs to be asked 'Are they serving God or Mamon?\" \nLast year the abbey said it supported alcohol education charities like Drinkaware , a fact disputed by the charity. \nIt has made about \u00a388m since 2004 from royalties made on each bottle of Buckfast sold, according to the Charity Commission. \nThe trust justifies its existence as a charity in its annual report, stating its aim is the \"advancement of the Roman Catholic religion\". Image copyright PA Image caption Buckfast Tonic Wine has been made by Benedictine monks at Buckfast Abbey in Devon for almost 100 years and is particularly popular in Scotland and Northern Ireland \nIn a statement, it said it would contact the Charity Commission. \nA Scottish sheriff said last year there was a \"very definite association between Buckfast and violence\". \nIn 2015, the Scottish Prison Service found 43.4% of inmates had consumed Buckfast before their last offence, despite it accounting for less than 1% of total alcohol sales nationally. \nThe Charity Commission said it took \"all complaints about registered charities seriously\" and would \"assess the information about the Buckfast Abbey Trust to determine if there is a regulatory role for the Commission\".",

Delhi A tech support scam begins by planting a pop-up message in the target user\u2019s web browser that alerts them to a so-called virus infection, employees and experts say.(LiveMint File Photo/Representative image) \nDusk is falling on Gurgaon\u2019s Sohna Road, an upscale neighbourhood crammed with gleaming steel-and-concrete buildings that power India\u2019s software surge and offer hopes of a brighter future to millions. \nIt\u2019s about 5pm. Backpack-laden young men and women pour out of cabs and auto-rickshaws and take a lift to the sixth-floor call centre of Saburi TLC, past a company motto inscribed in bright orange, \u201cIf you work only for money, you will never make it\u201d. \nIn 15 minutes, they diffuse into a maze of blue-and-white cubicles where they will spend the next eight hours with a computer, a desk phone and a pair of black headphones. \nThere are hundreds of similar call centres in the neighbourhood. But Saburi TLC is different, a shadowy outfit accused of being among the biggest players in a thriving tech-support fraud that cons unsuspecting foreigners into buying expensive security software for their perfectly normal computers. \nThe charges against Saburi TLC are just the tip of a growing rot in India\u2019s $110-billion business process outsourcing (BPO) industry that is being potentially hollowed out by fraud businesses thriving in the absence of strong regulation and oversight. \nMany of these dodgy businesses operate a stone\u2019s throw away from major companies in places such as Gurgaon, Pune and Bengaluru but are notoriously difficult to pin down because the victims are foreigners who can\u2019t file police complaints in India, and the firms are often run out of flats or nondescript locations by a handful of people. \nIf the trend isn\u2019t checked, experts warn, India might soon join the ranks of Nigeria and Vietnam where employment shrunk rapidly as investor confidence eroded because of high cybercrime rates and angry customers. \n\u201cAnyone doing bad things is not good for us because the impression gets generalised. In the mind of those affected by the scam it\u2019s not a company or a person, it becomes a country,\u201d says Raman Roy, chairman of India\u2019s main IT industry lobby NASSCOM. \nTestimonies of many victims float on the internet, in tech blogs, chat rooms and even with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the United States\u2019 consumer protection agency that has investigated several Indian BPOs for fraud. \nAsk Timothy Gatewood of Texas, United States. \u201cI got a pop-up notice from Apple saying \u2018you have virus infecting computer, call this number\u2019. So I called the number, and it was some guy with an Indian accent,\u201d the 53-year-old Houston-based DJ told Hindustan Times. Read more Call centre scam mastermind who gave girlfriend Rs 2.5-cr Audi held in Mumbai \n\u201cHe said he was a representative of Apple, and he\u2019s with this company, Tech Live Connect. I paid them 200 dollars, all they did was delete a couple (of) files, and maybe put a couple (of) apps from the App store, and said, there you go, bada-boom bada-bing, 200-something dollars!\u201d \nTech Live Connect\u2019s call centre is run by Saburi TLC whose promoter and CEO Anuj Jain has heard of these complaints but denies that the blame lies with his company. \n\u201cSome of our ex-employees impersonate us, which is why you see the complaints,\u201d Jain tells HT, sitting in a corner office with a wall full of certificates praising his achievements in the BPO industry. \u201cThey steal data from us and start calling our clients.\u201d \nJain, 42, says Tech Live Connect (TLC), a Singapore-based company, is one of Saburi TLC\u2019s \u201cmajor clients\u201d, handling their customer calls out of its call centre in Gurgaon. He denies any other links between the two companies. \nBut an HT investigation and interviews with former and present employees of Saburi TLC reveal the two companies are intimately connected. \nA SCARE-AND-SELL INDUSTRY \nIn the satellite city of Gurgaon, an hour\u2019s drive from downtown New Delhi, Saburi TLC\u2019s 20,000-sqft is manned by mostly fresh-out-of-college graduates, eager for a job and who don\u2019t ask too many questions. \nA tech support scam begins by planting a pop-up message in the target user\u2019s web browser that alerts them to a so-called virus infection, employees and experts say. The pop-up alarms the user, sometimes by locking their devices, forcing them to call a phone number flashing in the message. \nThe call is picked up by someone like Vikas Tanwar*. \n\u201cYou ask for remote access and show them temp files, run fake software to show fabricated security threats, and convince them their computer is corrupt. Then we tell them that if you don\u2019t buy our security products, the computer will become unusable,\u201d says Tanwar, who knew the scare-and-sell script by heart by the end of his first week at Saburi TLC. \n\u201cWe know there are no viruses. User ko to nahi pata (the user has no idea),\u201d says Anshul, 26, who gave only one name and who joined the company five years ago. Like other employees \u2013 past and present \u2013 HT spoke to Anshul wants to hide his name. \u201cThey will have me killed.\u201d \nTanwar, a 24-year-old commerce graduate, joined the company in November 2016. He says the brief was clear: To con every caller of anywhere between 10 and 500 dollars. \n\u201cThe moment you put on your headphones, your supervisor tells you \u2018you are scammers. Aapko customer ko fasana hai, kuch bhi kar ke\u2026 (you have to trap the customer, no matter how),\u201d says Tanwar, who quit Saburi TLC in February. \nIt\u2019s on the back of millions of English-speaking, tech-savvy college graduates like Anshul and Tanwar that the Indian BPO industry has grown to be a behemoth. But a paucity of jobs, easy access to foreign clients and lax regulation have caused an explosion in cyber-related crimes \u2013 exemplified last year when a Thane call centre was busted by Indian and US police for cheating 6,500 US nationals of almost $100 million. \nMAZE OF DECEIT \nJain\u2019s career maps the highs and lows of the Indian BPO industry, from a global powerhouse to a potential destination for the desperate and devious. From 2002 to 2011, Jain worked for a series of companies at the top of the BPO ladder, from Wipro to Quattro. Then, in November 2011, he launched Saburi TLC. \nThe first is registered in India under Jain\u2019s name and the second, Tech Live Connect, in Singapore under the name of Brian Cotter, a former colleague of Jain\u2019s at Quattro who left around the same time as him. \n\u201cNo one knows Saburi TLC as a brand. So we reach out to clients as Tech Live Connect, who see us as one company,\u201d says Jain. \nBut that argument flies in the face of evidence put together by HT. \nTech Live Connect is the owner of the domain, saburitlc.com \u2014 the official website of Saburi TLC. It\u2019s also from an email ID registered with the domain techliveconnect.com that Jain used to communicate with HT. On LinkedIn and Facebook, Jain introduces himself as director and chairman of Tech Live Connect. \nJain and Tech Live Connect promoter Brian Cotter attribute the overlap to the \u201cnature of partnership\u201d between them. Cotter told HT that Saburi TLC handled its clients\u2019 service and tech support calls. \nBLOWING THE LID \nTo be sure, Saburi TLC\u2019s operations include some legitimate services. Jain is the co-owner of Imagine Tressor, a premium reseller of Apple products with 11 stores across north India. He also runs two premium Apple service centres in and around Delhi. \nIn an industry where customer interface rarely goes beyond long distance calls, small legitimate operations often act as smokescreens for many fraudulent cyber businesses. \nTo capture the scam, an HT journalist called Tech Live Connect\u2019s registered number to complain that his perfectly healthy Windows laptop was running slow. \nHe was first instructed to hand over remote access to the computer and then told, in an escalating tone of alarm, about a range of security threats, from \u201cjunk files\u201d to \u201cvirus, malware, Trojan\u201d to that his \u201ccomputer has been hacked\u201d. \nThe journalist was told his computer would be \u201cunfixable\u201d if he didn\u2019t buy an $8 one-time fix followed by a year\u2019s worth of security service from Tech Live Connect. \nHad HT bought the security solution, Saburi TLC executives would have taken the customer through one of six or seven US-based payment gateways to deposit money in American bank accounts, says Tanwar, recapping steps he followed hundreds of times to extort money from unsuspecting clients. \n\u201cThey would then launder it back to India,\u201d he says. Tanwar thinks the call centre makes at least $5000 off the scam every day. Rajat Garg, a former Saburi TLC employee, says it makes $100,000 a day. \nTanwar made an average of 15 calls every day at Saburi TLC with a \u201ctarget\u201d of $500 on every call. \u201cIf you sell services worth $1000 dollars, you get 1000 rupees,\u201d says Tanwar, who made Rs 20,000 in monthly salary but a far bigger amount in \u201cincentives\u201d. \nHT also filed a request for information with the office of the US Freedom of Information Act, which revealed that the US FTC had received 699 consumer complaints against Tech Live Connect. The latest was filed on March 28 by a resident of Warner Robins, a city in the US state of Georgia, who narrated a harrowing tale of deceit and threats from Tech Live Connect. HT has copies of 50 such complaints. \nAsked if Tech Live Connect was under investigation, FTC spokesman Frank Dorman told Hindustan Times: \u201cAll information about investigations is nonpublic, including whether or not there is an investigation.\u201d \nBetter Business Bureau (BBB), a leading US consumer protection forum, set up a \u201cbusiness profile\u201d of Tech Live Connect on its website after receiving multiple complaints against it. \n\u201cWe especially do this if the company appears to have a pattern of complaints as was the case with Tech Live Connect,\u201d BBB spokeswoman Katherine Hutt told HT. Some of these complaints with BBB were resolved, mostly with a refund. Former Saburi TLC employees told HT this was done to avoid trouble and manage online reputation. \nLEGAL LOOPHOLES \nA 2016 Stony Brook University study showed that 86% of all tech scams originated in India. \n\u201cUnfortunately, the scale of such scams originating from India is huge,\u201d says Roy, also the founder of Quatrro, a big name in India\u2019s BPO industry. \u201cA small group of people with an internet connection and VoIP numbers can launch a tech support scam.\u201d \nAnd the art of scamming is not at all difficult to learn, says Garg, a former Saburi TLC employee. According to Garg, \u201ceven a 10th pass can get a job at TLC.\u201d \nGarg, 26, says he has worked for many such scam outfits. In 2012, he joined Saburi TLC but left in a year to join iYogi, a big name in Indian tech support, for a better salary. In 2015, he left iYogi after a lawsuit was filed against the company in the United States for running a tech support scam. \nIn 2016, he landed at Prime Technologies but lost his job the same year after founder Aman Mehndiratta \u2013 an ex-Saburi TLC employee -- was convicted in a US court of routing fraud money to India using the bank account of an American co-conspirator. \nBut why is it so difficult to shut down such companies? A major reason is the ease with which these companies can be launched or re-launched, experts say. \nApple and Microsoft know about the scale of the fraud. A Microsoft spokesperson told HT it has a dedicated online portal to report tech support scams, which receives an average of 10,000 consumer complaints a month. To a detailed questionnaire from HT, Apple just said, \u201cWe take security very seriously\u201d. \nVakul Sharma, an advocate at the Supreme Court, says India has the legal framework, but the complainants need to be physically present in an Indian court or send a lawyer as a representative. Hardly any American victim of tech scams do that. \nIn 2012, the US FTC charged six tech support firms with fraud in a US district court-- five in India alone.

We asked the experts: what's next? \nLess than 48 hours after the Trump administration's missile strike on a Syrian airfield, tensions in the region are already escalating. After Russian President Vladimir Putin called the strike an \"act of aggression,\" reports came out that a Russian frigate armed with missiles was headed for the region. Despite the attack, Syria has continued using the base, according to Syrian rights activists . And CNN reported Saturday that Khan Sheikhoun, the town subjected to the chemical attack that spurred the U.S. strike, was again the target of bombing over the weekend. \nWhat, though, comes next? \nThe initial opening up of a new American war front against the government of Bashar al-Assad came as a shock to the nation, and few answers are available. The Trump administration has not exactly been forthcoming. President Donald Trump has hewed to a position of evasiveness about his intentions in Syria (except for bowing to Moscow's demands for answers ). Experts on Syria and American foreign policy are left to try to make sense of it all amid Trump's ambiguity and a fluid situation on the ground. \nSome experts reached by Mic said that, for the most part, our involvement in the region isn't likely to change that much. \n\"This was a warning shot to the Assad regime,\" said Doug Ollivant, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation and a former National Security Council Director for Iraq in both the Bush and Obama administrations. \"Implied is that there would be an even greater or punitive strike were there to be a repeat [strike].\" \n\"This was a warning shot to the Assad regime.\" \nOllivant does not believe that this strike fundamentally changes the calculus of the Trump administration going forward. Referring to the administration's characterization of the attack as a \" one-off ,\" Ollivant said that Trump was trying to communicate that \"this does not fundamentally change the Trump administration's policy toward the Assad regime, which is not to seek regime change and to accept limited cooperation in the anti- ISIS fight.\" \nOthers felt that the ball is now in Russia's court. \"After launching this attack the direction that U.S. policy goes is out of U.S. hands.\" said Valerie Szybala the executive director of The Syria Institute, a research group. \"I don't think the Syrian government would risk a big move without Russia's approval and support.\" \nRussia has long been a backer of the Assad regime and, as of fall 2015, began providing Assad robust military support. During the presidential campaign, Trump signaled that he would be willing to work with Russia in the region to combat ISIS. Now, for the first time in his presidency, Russia and the U.S. appear to be in conflict over a major foreign policy issue. \n\"Russia does not actually want war with the U.S., and so it's not willing to take ultimate risks.\" \n\"My guess is that Russia does not actually want war with the U.S., and so it's not willing to take ultimate risks,\" Szybala said. \"My guess is that they will bluster quite a bit. But this is more brinksmanship and posturing than an actual attempt to engage with the U.S.\" \nWhile experts seem hopeful that the strike won't lead to any radical escalation, some are not so sanguine about the future . Stephen Miles, the executive director of Win Without War, a coalition of groups who opposed the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, fear the worst of the Trump administration's Syria policies. \n\"One of the most troubling aspects of this intervention though is how dangerously quick this could spiral into a major military confrontation,\" Miles said. \n\"The truth is that Donald Trump has no plan for ending the human suffering in Syria.\" \n\"The truth is that Donald Trump has no plan for ending the human suffering in Syria,\" added Miles. \"His administration is steaming full speed ahead with policies that would dramatically make that suffering worse from banning Syrian refugees entry into America to slashing funding for the very agencies that help feed and shelter those caught in war zones like Syria.\" ", "highlightTitle": "", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRhqZa.AmXbarC4JGVICG6yGT7U9Ic_qEMlud9ywg2xBcpj4b1u4y8FHSLmKPI_Ym0mYRhnmuGXXVBwr8Cjx_TGjAduKfzCCZVXbdhdiNzzWsltUnO3LkKf", "title": "Trump won't say what his Syria policy is.

But every Documenta, since the first in 1955, has served as a manifesto about art\u2019s current relevance and direction, and every one has taken place in Kassel, an unlovely town north of Frankfurt destroyed by Allied bombs in World War II . Photo Naeem Mohaiemen\u2019s \u201cTripoli Cancelled\u201d installation. Credit Mathias V\u00f6lzke Until this year. The 14th edition of Documenta, led by the 46-year-old Polish curator Adam Szymczyk , is being shared by Kassel and Athens, a city with intertwined crises of finance and migration, and the capital of a country whose recent relations with Germany have been anything but collaborative. Mr. Szymczyk and the bulk of his curatorial team have been living in Greece for years, and the Athenian half of this two-city show opened on Saturday, in the presence of the presidents of both countries. The local welcome has been skeptical . The German news media, too, has looked askance at Documenta\u2019s expansion into the capital of what some still offensively call a schuldenland, or debtor country. A full reckoning will have to wait until June, when the show\u2019s second half opens in Kassel. This much I can say now: If the exhibition falls short (far short, in places) of the great editions of 1972 and 2002, Mr. Szymczyk\u2019s decision to uproot Documenta was the right one. This Hellenized Documenta is sometimes forceful, often obscure, and in places exhaustingly proud of itself. Parts reminded me of the apartment rental app Airbnb , which allows young cosmopolitans to \u201cgo local\u201d on the cheap. And yet the show\u2019s most important themes \u2014 migration, debt, fraying European unity and the historical antecedents of today\u2019s populism and intolerance \u2014 are ones Athenians have reckoned with for years. Now that those troubles span the world, Greece may be the best place to come to grips with them. Photo \u201cMusic Room\u201d by Nevin Adalag.

For every familiar name, such as the American painters Vija Celmins, R. H. Quaytman and Stanley Whitney, there are 10 you\u2019ve never heard of, often for good reason. (Albanian socialist realism, weirdly, gets a major day in the sun.) It sprawls across 40 sites, as far afield as the port of Piraeus, though its most important is probably the new National Museum of Contemporary Art , or EMST, in an elegantly converted former brewery vacant for years . The accompanying bureaucratic and financial headaches are not incidental for Mr. Szymczyk, who opted to work with public institutions rather than Athens\u2019s cash-flush private museums. A fair chunk of Documenta\u2019s 37 million euro budget (about $40 million) has gone into nearly bankrupt Greek art organizations, which you can think of as an artsy stand-in for the eurozone transfer payments that Germany continues to resist. \nAdvertisement   Standout works at EMST include \u201cTripoli Canceled,\u201d a polished film by the New York-based artist Naeem Mohaiemen , set on an old 747 parked at the crumbling Hellenikon Airport in Athens. The pilot goes through the motions of announcing flight time, but never takes off; like the myriad migrants here whose movements are blocked by European Union regulations, this plane is stuck in Greece. A languorous video, by the British artists Rosalind Nashashibi and Lucy Skaer , revisits sites painted by Paul Gauguin in Tahiti, but the women they film rarely return their gaze. This honest, knowingly partial film is a model of how to depict other cultures ethically, and how not to shy away from the risks entailed.   A large gallery at EMST showcases music by the Soviet composer Arseny Avraamov, whose \u201c Symphony of Sirens ,\u201d backed by gun blasts and metallic droning, is a classic case of an artwork for a future that never came. Music and sound are major concerns of this Documenta, especially in the section housed at the Athens Conservatoire, Greece\u2019s oldest music school. Graphical scores by Greek composers such as Jani Christou and Bai Davou are juxtaposed with nifty diagrams of a rare synthesizer, the EMS Synthi 100, which the Documenta team has been restoring for Greek electronic musicians. Photo The Argentine artist Marta Minuj\u00edn, left, and an Angela Merkel impersonator at Documenta. Credit Eirini Vourloumis for The New York Times Greece\u2019s troubled relationship with Germany finds kitschy form in the EMST lobby. A large box there is filled with thousands of olives; the Argentine artist Marta Minuj\u00edn, rather daftly, proposes Greeks could win debt cancellation with stone fruit. (At a performance on Saturday, which I missed, Ms. Minuj\u00edn passed handfuls of the olives to a performer dressed in a red blazer and a frowzy wig, more than passable as German Chancellor Angela Merkel.) David Lamelas, another veteran Argentine, has rigged up a live feed at the entrance to the Conservatoire, showing debates in the Bundestag and the Hellenic Parliament \u2014 and a video of the Parthenon, looming as ever over this city.

A Bavarian was Greece\u2019s first king, after the country won independence from the Ottomans two centuries ago. Art history itself, in fact, is a Greek-German invention; it was 18th-century Prussian aesthetes, most prominently Johann Joachim Winckelmann, who first systematized the art of the past, and placed Greece at the summit.

Campy hoplites and temple maidens appear in dramatic photographs from 1970 by Pierre Zucca, whose collaborations with the great artist and writer Pierre Klossowski mashed up sex and economics. Flatter are the Polish artist Piotr Uklanski\u2019s reproduced stills from \u201cOlympia,\u201d Leni Riefenstahl\u2019s notorious Nazi propaganda film. They hang alongside dire older paintings of Hitler by the American duo McDermott and McGough , each meant to memorialize a gay victim of the Holocaust but undone by their cheapness. (The legacy of the Holocaust may be even more present in Documenta\u2019s Kassel half. Several artists are apparently working on projects related to the art collection of Cornelius Gurlitt , much of it believed to have been looted from Jewish families.)

The ongoing refugee crisis \u2014 a hopeless euphemism to describe the greatest moral failure of our time, which has left 65.3 million people displaced and pushed Greek social services to the breaking point \u2014 is inescapable in Documenta 14. Some artists here have responded poetically, including Peter Friedl, who films a stage adaptation of Kafka\u2019s \u201cReport to an Academy\u201d in which the ape narrator is played by actors and nonactors of various races, languages and ages. Other times it leads to self-righteousness or glibness, as with the wonky musical instruments made by Guillermo Galindo, a Mexican composer, incorporating tubes salvaged from a refugee camp near Kassel. And what are we to make of \u201cGlimpse,\u201d a 20-minute silent film by the Polish provocateur Artur Zmijewski that is this show\u2019s most important work, as well as its most disturbing? It\u2019s at the Athens School of Fine Arts, and was shot largely in the Jungle of Calais, France , the recently destroyed camp home to 6,000 migrants. The film\u2019s initial, documentary sequences of plywood shacks and pitiful tents, hopeless against the rain, are searingly accusatory. Some refugees stare down the camera; a young girl smiles, while her father looks down, abashed. But then the film\u2019s tone changes: The artist enters the frame, offers a new coat to a refugee and then paints its back with a dripping white X. Later, in Paris, he shoots African migrants in close-up, turning their heads slowly to get just the pose the artist wants. His film is brave and urgent; it\u2019s also shockingly discomforting, and stamps on our expectations of objectivity and respect in depicting the least fortunate. \nAdvertisement   While much of the rhetoric of Documenta 14 invokes a common humanity, \u201cGlimpse\u201d proposes that even the do-gooders have motives of their own. That is a sentiment many Athenians, skeptical of the intentions of this German-born megashow, will find easy to understand. All the same, one of the central aims of modern art has been to break through society\u2019s assumptions, to imagine living as equals even if we never get there. It takes courage to get your hands dirty, even if you wash them clean later in your Airbnb. \nDocumenta 14Through July 16 in Athens, and from June 10 to Sept. 17 in Kassel, Germany.

As a senior statesman, shouldn't you be bridging the gap, but almost endorsing azadi and Kashmir is lost to India? \nFarooq Abdullah: Sometime ago, a Parliamentary delegation came to Kashmir under the leadership of the home minister. The delegation was told that we will talk to the youth, and all the stakeholders. Have they done so, in a single step, in the last two years? Why do you blame me?\" \nQ: Because you want votes, you are stirring the pot..? \nA: Wake up, wake up. The situation is quite bad, and don't tell me Pakistan is not a party to this problem. Whether you like it or not, you have to talk to Pakistan. If you want to beat the threat of the terrorists, then you better start talking now. \nQ: With what end result? All the talking, and yet terrorists are sent across border, and violence continues? \nA: Let us start mending our fences, and start controlling present problem. Let's not burn, let's talk to the youth, Hurriyat, other leaders and come to a solution. \nQ: How are talks are going to be different this time? \nA: You have 8 people dead, and God knows how many injured. How long will you keep on doing this? You think it's all law and order? Or, you think by development you can change the mind of people?\" \nQ: Your critics will say that this is theatrics. When you are in power you speak differently, and now you seem to be catering to separatist sentiment? \nA: You are losing Kashmir. You better wake up, and start thinking on not a military solution, but a political way. And come down from your high horses...I am seeing a very bad situation. The youth is on boil. Which I have not seen before. \nThe situation remains tense in the Kashmir valley a day after violence and a historic low voter turnout, at 7 per cent, marred bypolls in Srinagar. \nThe Election Commission has postponed the bypolls in Anantnag Parliamentary constituency to May 25, 2016. \nThe decision came after Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti's brother Tasaduq Hussain Mufti, who is contesting a Parliamentary bypoll in Anantnag, appealed to the Election Commission to postpone his election. \nOn Sunday, 8 civilians were killed and school set on fire in Shopian, in incidences of poll violence in Kashmir.", "highlightTitle": "", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxSMGMZ1VQHBYxz9LUzWKzkwGgmyHm_WkKCjvUYiofgLAFLRhDJZLQgVeMh.OxaO.EeXZWtnzDjr_gppf0AkSBg.e6KwLIrCR1GUYiJCFS0gOZjcoBixjQFfAOhXzY373QRvl0yGO21E0pX8pVoXcKw", "title": "Farooq Abdullah: Wake up India, talk to Pakistan or lose Kashmir", "ord_in_thread": 0, "uuid": "e9face7feb48feef53378f763609c2ebfcd7e91a", "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-10T21:59:26.659+03:00"}, {"highlightText": "", "author": "", "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "vir da", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rana ayyub", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vir das", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "swati chaturvedi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nidhi razdan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bincy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bincy lal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ayyub", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shreya biswas", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kerala", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united arab emirates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharjah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delhi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "news - india today", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "uae", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "gulf news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alpha paints", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mnc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "thread": {"site_type": "news", "published": "2017-04-11T16:12:07.025+03:00", "performance_score": 9, "spam_score": 0.548, "uuid": "c1a658a698a186fc5d02197f235f0e90c2b25425", "country": "US", "replies_count": 0, "title": "UAE firm fires Kerala man for sending sexually abusive messages to journalist Rana Ayyub, Vir Das applauds move : FYI, News - India Today", "domain_rank": 654, "site_categories": ["news", "education"], "main_image": "http://media2.intoday.in/indiatoday/images/stories/647_041117022243.jpg", "participants_count": 0, "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 948, "likes": 948}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "site": "intoday.in", "section_title": "", "site_full": "indiatoday.intoday.in", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxSMGMZ1VQHBYxz9LUzWKzkwGgmyHm_WkI8SfupHJuaNUWvI0LQuKmLH7UJ751AilPMj02P_9YuhEeXs_fT92iEfiEgGIis2CHLDWuW8VUFNS2iLegmyxJq_k4lVQ0sw1J4y2FChlfb5g--", "site_section": "", "title_full": "UAE firm fires Kerala man for sending sexually abusive messages to journalist Rana Ayyub, Vir Das applauds move : FYI, News - India Today"}, "external_links": [], "language": "english", "published": "2017-04-11T16:12:07.025+03:00", "text": "FYI UAE firm fires Kerala man for sending sexually abusive messages to journalist Rana Ayyub, Vir Das applauds move A company in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has fired an Indian employee for abusing journalist Rana Ayyub on social media.

There's iron in the air all the time even over the bleach you can still smell it.\nYou hear stories of people throwing up on their first day or freaking out and leaving straight away. But most know what they're getting into. These are rough jobs, so while they're all good, honest lads who work in abattoirs, they kill things for a living. You have to have a bit of a different mindset for it. I grew up in the Lake District so I was hunting my whole life and used to have my own farm where I'd butcher my own animals. It's an early start 4:30AM and anearly finish 2PM and that suits me.\nThere arealways two parts inside an abattoir: a clean side and a dirty side. Animals have to go through the dirty side first before you go into where it's going to be prepared for human consumption. The dirty side is where all the gutsand the hair and the skin's removed. It's a proper production line, really.\nFirst they get electric shocks. Cows used to be done with a bolt gun. It was basically like the end of a shotgun barrel and you'd put that on the forehead of the cow and then hit the top of it with a hammer and it would send a bolt slowly into its brain. Obviously they could see it happening and were scared shitless. It was quite horrible 20 years ago, but regulations in place at work now make it a lot better. You've got to keep an animal de-stressed, because there's nothing worse than a stressed animal before it's slaughtered. You ruin the meat, so it's worth nothing anyway. Now, they use the electrocution method, which is a lot more humane.\n\"When you'd fix the pig dehairer, because of all the fats,oils and bits of pig on it, as soon as you started welding somethingit'd turn into basically smelling like a rotten bacon sandwich.\"\nThen you slit and bleed them it usually takes four or five hours to bleeda cow or a pig, or something of that size. Then you've got all of this dirty stuff to do, which is quite a nasty process. You have to take all their innards out and throw it together as contaminated waste. So you have barrels of guts basically just hanging around. Next is the processing: de-skin, de-furring. Dice them up and bag them up. If they weren't doing human food say, cat or dog food then all the regulations change;everything speeds up and you could get away with a lot more. \nA lot of what I was doing was machinery repairs, which was gruesome. Some were huge band saws, which could cut a whole cow in half easily. I had to fix the pig dehairer often. Once the pig had been bledit was put into this cylinder-shaped machine that looked like the inside of a cheese grater but not quite as sharp. The pig was spun in it to take the fine hair off. So you'd have a pig that was bouncing around in this cylinder three to four feet in the air, as it was going round and obviously that's a lot of weight coming down, so it used to break quite regularly. When you'd fix it, because of all the fats and the oils and bits of pig that were on it, as soon as you started welding something and putting heat into itit'd turn into basically smelling like a rotten bacon sandwich. It was quite grim. Almost enough to put you off but not quite! \n\"Like any office there's banter and practical jokes. It's quite regular that someone will open their lunch box and find acow's tongue in there or something.\"\nTo be fair, the hygiene side of it is phenomenal. You literally can't get away with anything. Abattoirs are inspected so regularly it's mental. Most people don't realise you spend a lot of your day cleaning. \nIt all sounds awful, but like any office there's banter and practical jokes. It's quite regular that someone will open their lunch box and find a cow's tongue in there or something. \nThe darkest time was during the foot-and-mouth crisis in the early 2000s. So many lads lost their jobs,but lots of us were paid a ridiculously huge amount of money to go to the farms and help kill all the animals. You'd be killing 300 to400 cows a day, for weeks. I was a loader, so I'd load bodies onto the fire, which is the only way you could kill the disease. There were just piles and piles of burning bodies, big black acidic smoke and the smell of barbecue in the air. You had to keep going over to make sure the bodies were still burning. Most people couldn't cut it, crying, and had to leave. \nThat was when the bolt guns started coming out again because you just couldn't do it any other way at its height there were up to 50 new cases a day. Cows aren't stupid;they could hear the bangs going off, probably thinking, 'All my mates go through that curtain and then the bangs go off.' Some animals were deep into the foot-and-mouth symptoms. It attacks the nervous system, and the back legs are usually first to go, so they can hardly walk and are falling over.You had to almost pick them up to take them to get killed.\n\"We saved thousands of British farms but it was not the nicest situation for man or beast. I wouldn't want to live through itagain.\"\nThere was a human side to it, too, dealing with the farmers affected and their families. They were losing their entire stock of animals, literally going bankrupt overnight. I was going back round to my farm very worried about whether I had it on me what if I am carrying it home, bringing it into my area? \nWe saved thousands of British farms,but it wasn't the nicest situation for man or beast. It was a very hard time because you never really see death on that sort of scale, even if you're at an abattoir every single day. I wouldn't want to live through itagain.\nBut honestly? I find the whole process of the job quite a rewarding thing. You go out, you kill an animal, you butcher it, you eat it.It's not got all the chemicals and preservatives. The biggest problem is that people don't know where their food is from;they don't think about the process.Food is all too easy. None of them really know that milk and meat comes from a cow. They don't think of me, they don't think of my job in there.\n@hannahrosewens \nMore fromVICE: \nYour Job Is Pointless \nThe Isolating Life of a Railway Engineer \n10 Questions YouAlways Wanted to Ask a Gynaecologist", "highlightTitle": "", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT7LPYakljWjybzhtyDBPCDfPICB7rIWDCKuxl1q2SAjDTExhG9Cyy4Fzt3HBI3IjZp2nWhjtWnQScy2qFN6bSYhmRAVv60E08-", "title": "What It's Really Like to Work in an Abattoir", "ord_in_thread": 0, "uuid": "9ad6080d61aae44b28f8e311a8c5414a5d9e93dd", "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-10T16:27:12.608+03:00"}, {"highlightText": "", "author": "Loulla-Mae Eleftheriou-Smith", "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "randi rotjan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terry hughes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hughes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james kerry", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "great barrier reef", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arc centre for excellence for coral reef studies", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "el nino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boston university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james cook university", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "thread": {"site_type": "news", "published": "2017-04-10T13:07:00.401+03:00", "performance_score": 9, "spam_score": 0.0, "uuid": "25e0759c0cb2485f56076ffbcd2b20846b726e77", "country": "GB", "replies_count": 0, "title": "Great Barrier Reef: Second mass bleaching in 12 months devastates two thirds of coral", "domain_rank": 568, "site_categories": ["news", "entertainment", "education"], "main_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/10/10/coral-reef-bleaching.jpg", "participants_count": 1, "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 944, "likes": 944}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}}, "site": "independent.co.uk", "section_title": "The Independent - News", "site_full": "www.independent.co.uk", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_kNOYMWIthylTUGkFjTM60jqqdDuDF8RID7YNRMqCL56tj55KJPSMgaI69NGTxVFPAEyX1v9Gibd3WmhSl4u3NfMdpR5IAvBH7FItKx5ljW2VmWNg_DmFiKEk4ag.r4HzUQIRW1k_HbScvbPjO0KkCkdfGU_1kqLooJ22V07H60Os1ezPuVK1H4ylxW1QJM4kwIcXdL1fzBQ--", "site_section": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/rss", "title_full": "Great Barrier Reef: Second mass bleaching in 12 months devastates two thirds of coral | The Independent"}, "external_links": [], "language": "english", "published": "2017-04-10T13:07:00.401+03:00", "text": "Two thirds of Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef has been severely affected by two consecutive years of mass bleaching, according to new aerial surveys.\nBleaching is caused by abnormal environmental conditions, such as heightened sea temperatures, which causes coral to drive out the algae known as zooxanthallae that gives them colour, leaving the coral bleached and looking white.\nLast year mass bleaching left 35 per cent of the northern and central parts of the coral either dead or dying. It is possible for coral that has been bleached to recover if the algae can recolonize it, but it can take years and requires the water temperature to drop. This year\u2019s bleaching marks the fourth time the Great Barrier Reef has experienced severe bleaching since 1998, and the second mass bleaching that has happened in the space of 12 months. \nProfessor Terry Hughes and Dr James Kerry at the ARC Centre for Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University carried out the aerial surveys that covered more than 8,000km. This year, only the southern third of the reef has been left untouched. Mr Hughes claimed that while the reef is struggling with multiple impacts, such as the effects of Tropical Cyclone Debbie that recently hit the area or last year\u2019s El Nino, the record-breaking temperatures driven by global warming is the most pressing problem.\nSpeaking to The Guardian , Mr Hughes said there is concern over the frequency of bleaching of the reef when it takes around 10 years for some of the coral to recover from these events. \n\u201cThe significance of bleaching this year is that it\u2019s back to back, so there\u2019s been zero time for recovery,\u201d he said, adding that while it is too early to tell the extent of the damage that will be caused by this year\u2019s bleaching, the effects will be seen up to 500km south of the areas damaged last year.\nHe told the BBC this is the shortest gap that has been seen between mass bleaching. \u201cThe sooner we take action on global greenhouse gas emissions and transition away from fossil fuels to renewables, the better.\u201d\nRandi Rotjan, a marine biologist at Boston University in Massachusetts called the news \u201creally scary,\u201d and likened the bleaching to the reef \u201closing its insurance policy\u201d.\n\u201cThe scale of the devastation means its losing its potential to reseed the parts of the reef that were previously damaged,\u201d he told New Scientist .", "highlightTitle": "", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_kNOYMWIthylTUGkFjTM60jqqdDuDF8RID7YNRMqCL56tj55KJPSMgaI69NGTxVFPAEyX1v9Gibd3WmhSl4u3NfMdpR5IAvBH7FItKx5ljW2VmWNg_DmFiKEk4ag.r4HzUQIRW1k_HbScvbPjO0KkCkdfGU_1kqLooJ22V07H60Os1ezPuVK1H4ylxW1QJM4kwIcXdL1fzBQ--", "title": "Great Barrier Reef: Second mass bleaching in 12 months devastates two thirds of coral", "ord_in_thread": 0, "uuid": "25e0759c0cb2485f56076ffbcd2b20846b726e77", "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-10T13:07:00.401+03:00"}, {"highlightText": "", "author": "BBC", "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "thread": {"site_type": "news", "published": "2017-04-11T00:20:41.583+03:00", "performance_score": 9, "spam_score": 0.0, "uuid": "d6950df8a567bf02b8dca3ad3237052221fab254", "country": "GB", "replies_count": 0, "title": "Syria war: US missiles 'took out 20% of aircraft'", "domain_rank": 130, "site_categories": ["news", "entertainment", "education"], "main_image": "https://ichef-1.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/13733/production/_95576697_mediaitem95576696.jpg", "participants_count": 1, "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 948, "likes": 948}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 10}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 5}}, "site": "bbc.com", "section_title": "World -

The two-day meeting of foreign ministers in Lucca in Tuscany is aiming to hammer out a unified approach to the Syria conflict.\nUK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the message from the meeting should be clear - that Russian President Vladimir Putin must be made to abandon his support for Mr Assad.\n\"He's toxifying the reputation of Russia by his continual association with a guy who has flagrantly poisoned his own people,\" Mr Johnson said.\nBoris Johnson said sanctions on the Syrian and Russian militaries were being discussed He said the meeting would be \" discussing the possibility of further sanctions certainly on some of the Syrian military figures and indeed on some of the Russian military figures who have been involved in co-ordinating the Syrian military efforts\".\nDecoding Russia's response to Johnson's cancelled trip\nRussia is already under a raft of sanctions imposed by the US and EU in response to the annexation of Crimea and the crisis in eastern Ukraine.\nThese would be the first sanctions against Russian figures over Syria if they were to be adopted, but it is far from clear they will be.\nUS Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will want to go from the G7 talks to Moscow on Tuesday to confront the Russians with a unified set of demands.\nHowever, Reuters news agency Quote: d one senior European diplomat as saying that the US was \"navigating aimlessly in the dark\" in the search for a transfer of power in Syria.\nThe G7 groups Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US, with the European Union also represented.\nSanctions already on Russia over Crimea\nWhat is US policy on Syria? That is what the other G7 ministers will be seeking to clarify.\nThe G7 foreign ministers pose for a family photo in Lucca Mr Tillerson strongly criticised Russia for failing to prevent Syria from carrying out the suspected chemical attack.\nBut he also said there had been \"no change to our military posture\" in Syria following the US retaliatory strike and that Washington's \"first priority\" in Syria was to defeat so-called Islamic State (IS).\nThe US ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, also appears to have given mixed signals.\n\"In no way do we see peace in that area with Assad as the head of the Syrian government,\" she told NBC's Meet the Press, a week after she had said that Mr Assad's removal was no longer a US priority.\nWhite House sources said any difference in nuance between her comments and administration policy was \"inadvertent and unintentional\".\nAttacking the Shayrat airbase was the kind of direct intervention in Syria's six-year-old civil war that Donald Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, had avoided.\nUntil Friday's strike, so did Mr Trump. He opposed military action in 2013 and campaigned on a platform of fixing problems in the US, not Syria.\nDuring the election campaign he expressed wariness that US military action in Syria might lead to conflict with Russia.\nAnd while viewing the airbase strike as decisive, most commentators are not seeing a radical change in the US approach to Syria.\nIs Trump slipping into Syria quagmire?\nTrump acts decisively in Syria: Now what?\nWhat are Syria and its allies saying?

The Japan News reports that JAMSTEC is looking at the early part of 2020 to start drilling. They will be using a highly-advanced deep sea scientific drilling vessel, the Chikyu. Preliminary studies will be conducted in the waters off Hawaii in September. The area is considered as a leading candidate site for the drilling project. Other candidate sites include the waters off Mexico and Costa Rica. ADVERTISEMENT Around 80 percent of the Earth\u2019s mass is composed of the mantle. It lies directly under the crust on which we dwell. The mantle is constantly moving slowly and affects continental drift, plate movements that cause earthquakes, and volcanic activity. The goal of the project is to directly observe the mantle. By doing so, scientists hope to learn more of its hardness and water content. This would allow for a better understanding of plate movements and how our planet was formed. Drilling through the crust is apparently much easier because the oceanic crust is only around six kilometers thick. Continental crust on the other hand is several dozens thicker. Previously, a drilling operation of this magnitude could not be attempted due to limitations on tools and materials. However, newly developed materials have now made it technically possible, but the cost will be substantial. They estimate that a total of 60 billion yen is needed to fund the project. \u201cThere are still issues to be resolved, particularly the cost,\u201d said Susumu Umino, a professor at Kanazawa University who specializes in petrology. \u201cHowever, the preliminary study will be a big step forward for this project to enter a new stage.\u201d What will the researchers find 6 kilometers under the ocean crust? Will there be a hidden world under our own as some works of fiction have depicted, or will there just be a whole lot more of rocks?

Credit Odd Andersen/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images The Uzbek man arrested in the terrorism rampage in central Stockholm last week was an asylum seeker whose application was rejected and who in December was given four weeks to leave the country, the Swedish police said on Sunday. The 39-year-old suspect had shown \u201csympathy for extremist organizations,\u201d the police said. He applied for permanent residency in 2014, and the Swedish Migration Agency denied his application in June 2016, officials said. The police tried to find him in February of this year to execute the exit order, but he had gone underground, becoming a wanted man, said Jonas Hysing, the national strategic commander, at a news conference at the Stockholm police headquarters. \u201cWe know that he has shown sympathy for extremist organizations like I.S.,\u201d Mr. Hysing said, referring to the Islamic State terrorist group. On Friday, the man was arrested in connection with an attack in which a beer truck was stolen and used to mow down a crowd of people, killing four and injuring 15 others. \n  On Sunday, the police released more information about the victims after informing their next of kin. The dead included two Swedish citizens, one Briton and one Belgian, said Jan Evensson, the strategic commander of the Stockholm police. A police spokesman, Kjell Lindgren, said a second person was being held on suspicion of participating in the attack. The assault, in a city known for its tolerance and open society, came after the Swedish Security Service, or Sapo, warned in March in its annual security report that a terrorist acting alone was likely to attack somewhere in the country within a year. \n  Hans Brun, a security expert with the Swedish Defence University, said the police had been preparing for such an assault for a long time. \u201cUnfortunately, this type of low-tech attack is something we have been discussing for years,\u201d he said, adding that the police, Sapo and other government agencies had been honing their routines for years, resulting in a well-coordinated response on Friday. \nAdvertisement \u201cThey put Stockholm under lockdown quite quickly,\u201d Mr. Brun said in a phone interview. \u201cThey shut down the subway. They found the perpetrator quickly and, obviously, had some reliable intelligence quite early on.\u201d  ", "highlightTitle": "", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxTqL_zg0lpoRQRgRQKqe.CfkrHgsk0zT8yKZf9wGpqvhigkNc59ch1CzRH3jLxkBjVtTUjjYiAic-", "title": "Sweden Attack Suspect Had Been Told to Leave the Country", "ord_in_thread": 0, "uuid": "5acc55a73cf01b9b8dcffd53aeadc896738bd160", "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-09T17:38:24.288+03:00"}, {"highlightText": "", "author": "", "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [{"name": "raipur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sharjah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "air arabia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kathmandu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucknow", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "india today", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "thread": {"site_type": "news", "published": "2017-04-09T20:39:19.545+03:00", "performance_score": 9, "spam_score": 0.0, "uuid": "05e431c0f39145d15dd39fc9de924891a3135211", "country": "IN", "replies_count": 0, "title": "IndiGo flight makes emergency landing at Raipur airport after bird hit", "domain_rank": 654, "site_categories": ["news", "education"], "main_image": "http://media2.intoday.in/indiatoday/images/stories/indigo-story_647_040917102932.jpg", "participants_count": 0, "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 973, "likes": 973}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "site": "intoday.in", "section_title": "India Today| Top Stories", "site_full": "indiatoday.intoday.in", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/m1nCBNv_poxSMGMZ1VQHBYxz9LUzWKzkwGgmyHm_WkK7H0gicFz2.0myAeW5Y7gl4nxSKb2Ja9hAKc1QgaXMp4J1Y2U6HY8cByYOkdtqvZpIagPu8gotXa0K.Oai_w8JQxtp1rQdrBVytabFz_5UcA--", "site_section": "http://indiatoday.intoday.in/rss/article.jsp?sid=4", "title_full": "IndiGo flight makes emergency landing at Raipur airport after bird hit"}, "external_links": [], "language": "english", "published": "2017-04-09T20:39:19.545+03:00", "text": "IndiGo flight makes emergency landing at Raipur airport after bird hit The Kolkata-bound flight from Raipur was made to return due to the incident.
