The Islamic State group quickly claimed responsibility for the attack, which hit just three days before a tense presidential election. Security already has been a dominant theme in the campaign, and the violence on the sparkling avenue threatened to weigh on voters' decisions. Candidates canceled or rescheduled final campaign events ahead of Sunday's first round vote.\nInvestigators searched a home early Friday in an eastern suburb of Paris believed linked to the attack. A police document obtained by The Associated Press identifies the address searched in the town of Chelles as the family home of Karim Cheurfi, a 39-year-old with a criminal record.\nPolice tape surrounded the quiet, middle-class neighborhood in Chelles, and worried neighbors expressed surprise at the searches. Archive reports by French newspaper Le Parisien say that Cheurfi was convicted of attacking a police officer in 2001.\nAuthorities are trying to determine whether \"one or more people\" might have helped the attacker, Interior Ministry spokesman Pierre-Henry Brandet told reporters at the scene of the shooting.\nOne officer was killed and two police officers were seriously wounded when the attacker emerged from a car and used an automatic weapon to shoot at officers outside a Marks & Spencer's department store at the center of the Champs-Elysees, anti-terrorism prosecutor Francois Molins said.\nA female foreign tourist also was wounded, Molins said.\nThe Islamic State group's claim of responsibility just a few hours after the attack came unusually swiftly for the extremist group, which has been losing territory in Iraq and Syria.\nIn a statement from its Amaq news agency, the group gave a pseudonym for the shooter, Abu Yusuf al-Beljiki, indicating he was Belgian or had lived in Belgium. Belgian authorities said they had no information about the suspect. IS described the shootings as an attack \"in the heart of Paris.\"\nThe attacker had been flagged as an extremist, according to two police officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss the investigation.\nBrandet said officers were \"deliberately\" targeted, as has happened repeatedly to French security forces in recent years, including preceding the 2012 election.\nPolice and soldiers sealed off the area, ordering tourists back into hotels and blocking people from approaching the scene.\nEmergency vehicles blocked the wide Champs-Elysees, an avenue lined with boutiques and normally packed with cars and tourists that cuts across central Paris between the Arc de Triomphe and the Tuileries Gardens. Subway stations were closed off.\nThe gunfire sent scores of tourists fleeing into side streets.\n\"They were running, running,\" said 55-year-old Badi Fta\u00efti, who lives in the area. \"Some were crying. There were tens, maybe even hundreds of them.\"\nFrench President Francois Hollande said he was convinced the circumstances of the attack in a country pointed to a terrorist act. Hollande held an emergency meeting with the prime minister Thursday night and planned to convene the defense council Friday morning.\nThe incident recalled two recent attacks on soldiers providing security at prominent locations around Paris: one at the Louvre museum in February and one at Orly airport last month.\nSpeaking in Washington during a news conference with Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, U.S. President Donald Trump said the shooting \"looks like another terrorist attack\" and sent condolences to France.\nA French television station hosting an event with the 11 candidates running for president briefly interrupted its broadcast to report the shootings.\nConservative contender Francois Fillon, who has campaigned against \"Islamic totalitarianism,\" said on France 2 television that he was canceling his planned campaign stops Friday.\nFar-right candidate Marine Le Pen, who campaigns against immigration and Islamic fundamentalism, took to Twitter to offer her sympathy for law enforcement officers \"once again targeted.\" She canceled a minor campaign stop, but scheduled another.\nCentrist candidate Emmanuel Macron offered his thoughts to the family of the dead officer.\nSocialist Benoit Hamon tweeted his \"full support\" to police against terrorism.\nThe two top finishers in Sunday's election will advance to a runoff on May 7.\n___\nAssociated Press Writers Angela Charlton and Raphael Satter in Paris, Jeff Schaeffer and Nadine Achoui-Lesage in Chelles, France, and Raf Casert in Brussels contributed to this report.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "johanna primevert", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "associated press", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "franklin roosevelt subway station", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "champs-elysees", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-20T22:50:42.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "60d53f7b1b63945081290daa0150c66cafb3ad6e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxTqL_zg0lpoRDdL5TZHA6b6tMVLogNi_pKc8G447AnpkTl1nSEQhqbSdQv2cTHrfr6xte_u5i7eKipemAPrf0QPWJvejga4VQG6URRKlzwzY-", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "site": "nytimes.com", "site_section": "http://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/US.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "NYT > U.S.", "title": "California\u2019s Deluge of Rain Washes Away a Homeless Colony", "title_full": "California\u2019s Deluge of Rain Washes Away a Homeless Colony", "published": "2017-04-21T16:01:40.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/17/us/00homeless-01/00homeless-01-facebookJumbo.jpg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 98, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 999, "comments": 0, "shares": 999}, "gplus": {"shares": 7}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "60d53f7b1b63945081290daa0150c66cafb3ad6e", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxTqL_zg0lpoRDdL5TZHA6b6tMVLogNi_pKc8G447AnpkTl1nSEQhqbSdQv2cTHrfr6xte_u5i7eKipemAPrf0QPWJvejga4VQG6URRKlzwzY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "ADAM NAGOURNEY", "published": "2017-04-21T16:01:40.000+03:00", "title": "California\u2019s Deluge of Rain Washes Away a Homeless Colony", "text": "Privacy Policy Mr. Traylor\u2019s struggle with homelessness began when his father committed suicide in 2010, when he was 30, and continued until he was sent to the California Correctional Institution in Tehachapi in 2015 for stealing a car and trying to outrace the police.

Credit Jim Wilson/The New York Times Darrell Steinberg was elected mayor of Sacramento last year after stepping down as the leader of the California Senate, one of the three most powerful jobs in state government, because of term limits. Mr. Steinberg, 57, is a Democrat and ran for mayor on a pledge to help the homeless . He has lived in Sacramento for 32 years. The storms arrived with the start of his mayoralty in December. Those two deaths occurred shortly after he took office, and he responded by opening five warming centers for homeless people to escape to on cold nights.

(Photo: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for Victoria\u2019s Secret) More Caitlyn Jenner is spilling all the (alleged) tea in her upcoming memoir, and her ex-wife Kris Jenner isn\u2019t having it. In a clip for Sunday\u2019s Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Kris vents to daughters Khlo\u00e9 and Kim after reading an advanced copy of The Secrets of My Life .\n\u201cI read it, and basically the only nice thing she had to say was that I was great socially at a party one time,\u201d Kris, who was married to Bruce for 22 years, tells her daughters. \u201cNone of it makes sense. Everything she says is all made up. Why does everything have to be that Kris is such a b**** and an a**hole?\u201d\nIt\u2019s been about two years since the gold medal-winning Olympian publicly transitioned from Bruce to Caitlyn. Since then, one of the biggest points of contention between Kris and Caitlyn has been over when Kris knew about her former husband\u2019s gender identity struggle. That is brought up again in Caitlyn\u2019s book.\n\u201cI was curious and said, \u2018What the hell is going on?\u2019\u201d Kris, 61, reflects on pressing Bruce years ago. \u201cShe said, \u2018You just would never understand.\u2019 And then, all through the book, Kris knew. \u2018Kris knew before I even made love to her.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018What?\u2019\u201d\nThat\u2019s not all Caitlyn has to say about their intimate life. In an excerpt obtained by People , she describes the sex as \u201cimbued with love\u201d but admits she wasn\u2019t \u201centirely comfortable\u201d with the act.\nView photos\nBruce and Kris Jenner were married for 22 years. (Photo: Beck Starr/FilmMagic) More \u201cWe fall in love quickly (we marry after seven months),\u201d Caitlyn writes . \u201cSince \u2014 let\u2019s not kid ourselves \u2014 everyone wants to know, Kris and I have good and frequent sex at the beginning.\u201d\nShe continues, \u201cI tell Kris about my gender issues before I make love to her. This will always be a subject of dispute between us. She insists that she was taken by surprise by my ultimate transition to Caitlyn, which obviously means in her mind that she did not know enough.\u201d\nCaitlyn, 67, adds she dressed as a woman a number of times in front of Kris.\nAll that info apparently is enough for Kris to be \u201cdone\u201d with Caitlyn. \u201cI\u2019ve never been so angry and disappointed in someone in my whole life,\u201d Kris says on Sunday\u2019s Keeping Up . \u201cI\u2019m not going to be used as a person who benefits someone else\u2019s life just to make them look better.

Credit Leon Neal/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images LOS ANGELES \u2014 A five-studio tug of war has broken out over James Bond.\nFor more than a decade, starting with \u201cCasino Royale\u201d in 2006, the superspy series has been based at Sony Pictures Entertainment . It has been a period of stability and prosperity for 007, as global ticket sales reached new heights. The four Bond films that Sony has released collected $3.5 billion at the worldwide box office, after adjusting for inflation.\nBut Sony\u2019s contract to market and distribute the films expired in 2015 with \u201cSpectre.\u201d So the two companies that control the franchise but do not distribute their own films \u2014 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and the family-run Eon Productions \u2014 have started attending dog and pony shows put on by studios that want the rights, according to five people briefed on the sessions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.\nOn Tuesday, for instance, leaders at Sony spent an hour making their case. Kazuo Hirai, the chief executive, helped give the pitch, which emphasized the studio\u2019s deep knowledge of Bond and its ideas for expanding the franchise\u2019s reach. In true Hollywood fashion, Sony gave its presentation inside a sound stage on a recreated set from \u201cDr. No,\u201d which was released in the United States in 1963 by United Artists and laid the foundation for the entire series.\nAlso vying for the Bond deal \u2014 even though it pays surprisingly little \u2014 are Warner Bros. , Universal Pictures, 20th Century Fox and Annapurna, an ambitious upstart financed and led by the Oracle heiress Megan Ellison . (Not competing for the business are Paramount, which has been struggling and recently hired a new chairman , and Walt Disney Studios, which has been on a box office hot streak by focusing on its own family film labels.)\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story MGM and Eon, which stands for Everything or Nothing, are only offering a one-film contract. The expired Sony deal was for four movies. MGM, which is owned by private equity firms, including Anchorage Capital Partners, probably wants to keep its options open as it considers a sale or public offering.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story Casting for the franchise has not been discussed in the meetings, according to the people briefed on them, although producers hope Daniel Craig will play the lead for at least one more chapter. He has a gap on his docket, according to movie industry databases, that would allow for filming.\nRepresentatives for MGM, Eon and the studios pursuing the rights either had no comment or did not return calls.\nThe eagerness to land Bond underscores the continuing strength of the series but also the realities of the modern movie business. As competition for leisure time increases, studios have focused more intently on global blockbusters, and those are in short supply. In some ways, the Bond series was the first to go after a worldwide audience.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Privacy Policy Yet the deal that studios are hotly chasing is not very profitable.\nUnder its previous agreement, Sony paid 50 percent of the production costs for \u201cSpectre\u201d \u2014 which totaled some $250 million after accounting for government incentives \u2014 but received only 25 percent of certain profits, once costs were recouped. Sony also shouldered tens of millions of dollars in marketing and had to give MGM a piece of the profit from non-Bond films Sony had in its own pipeline, including \u201c22 Jump Street.\u201d\nIn a 2014 email stolen by hackers and widely published online, Andrew Gumpert, who then oversaw business affairs for Sony, figured that the studio would realize about $38 million in profit if \u201cSpectre\u201d performed as \u201cSkyfall\u201d did. And \u201cSpectre\u201d did not, taking in $881 million, about 20 percent less than \u201cSkyfall,\u201d which was released in 2012.\nWhy, then, do studios want to distribute Bond so badly? Bragging rights, mostly. Having a Bond movie on the schedule guarantees at least one hit in a business where there is almost no sure thing.\nBond is gargantuan: The 25 movies have taken in nearly $6 billion at the North American box office, after adjusting for inflation, according to Box Office Mojo. The series has generated billions more in overseas ticket sales, home entertainment revenue, television reruns, marketing partnerships (Omega watches, Aston Martin cars, Gillette razors) and video games.\nFor at least one suitor, Annapurna, landing Bond would be transformative. Ms. Ellison started by focusing on prestige films like \u201cHer\u201d and \u201cAmerican Hustle.\u201d But she has been diversifying toward more commercial movies like the animated hit \u201cSausage Party\u201d and recently hired a senior 20th Century Fox executive to serve as president of her company. Last month, Annapurna signed an unrelated distribution deal with MGM.\nThe person Ms. Ellison and the other bidders need to impress the most is Barbara Broccoli, who runs Eon Productions. Moviemaking is a collaborative process, but Ms. Broccoli and her older half brother, Michael G.

Credit Mekameleen TV, via Youtube A video has emerged that appears to show members of the Egyptian military shooting unarmed detainees to death at point-blank range in the Sinai Peninsula and staging the killings to look as if they had happened in combat.\nThe leaked video, which was posted on social media on Thursday, could undercut claims made by the Egyptian Army in December that the men were suspected terrorists who died in a fight with the military.\nThe video was released the same day that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis met in Egypt with its president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, to discuss improving their countries\u2019 military relationship. It also comes after human rights groups accused the Egyptian military of killing up to 10 men in January in a staged counterterrorism raid in Sinai.\nThe three-minute video, which was released through a channel associated with the Muslim Brotherhood , appears to depict part of a raid that the Egyptian Army highlighted in a Facebook post on Dec. 6, 2016 . That post included photos of three bloody men in a grassy area with rifles next to them. The post said they had been killed in a military raid on a terrorist base and an explosives storehouse.\nEight people were killed and four others were arrested, the military said on Facebook in December, as Egyptian armed forces \u201ccontinued to tighten their security grip\u201d in the Sinai Peninsula, where the country has waged a yearslong battle.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story But the video shows no firefight and starts with soldiers mingling next to an armored truck in a sandy field scattered with bodies next to shrubs and grassy patches. But it does show the killing of at least three people. In one case, a soldier casually holds a rifle over a man on the ground and shoots him in the head. In another, soldiers escort a blindfolded man into the field, place him on his knees and shoot him multiple times in the head and upper body.\nThe pro-state Egyptian news site Youm7 called the video a fabrication carried out by the Muslim Brotherhood, which is banned in the country, and said the people in the video did not have Egyptian accents.

Between a flawed love life, a flailing career and daily struggles with weight, she finds her meaty story. Noor Review : Who knew Sonakshi Sinha was capable of this all along? movie Watching her play this part is the most starkly disorienting thing about Noor. The movie gives her a chance to be an actual flesh-and-bone person. She\u2019s relatable as a girl who swears by her rum (and suffers hangovers), eats cake in bed (and dreads getting on a weighing scale) and becomes the third wheel on a friend\u2019s date (while cursing her own single life). We\u2019ve all been there. Noor (Sinha) wants to shine a light on serious issues but is stuck being the torchbearer of mediocre puff pieces. Her childhood friend Saad (Gill) gives her pep-talks from the friendzone and her mentor (Chaudhary) reigns her in when she\u2019s too enthusiastic about a new expos\u00e9. Even as she\u2019s coming to terms with the hotness of her new boyfriend, Ayan (Kohli), her maid Malti (Tambe) brings a major organ-trade racket to her notice. Director Sunhil Sippy has achieved the rare feat of not stereotyping people in the media by showing them as jhola-toting opinionated creatures. There\u2019s an instant connect with Noor\u2019s world; her friends are as silly as yours, her issues are at times frivolous but her quarter-life crisis seems credible. The film is slightly over-written (a whole lot of dialogue) but lines are mostly funny. Since the movie gets this generation right, it has to get its flaws right too. Noor introduces a conflict which is serious and relevant, but offers very little by way of resolution. It unintentionally gives a nod to armchair-activism, and as representative of our time as it is, it simply cannot cover-up the lazy writing towards the end. A slightly stronger effort on the protagonist\u2019s part could have propelled the movie into greatness. But where Noor falls short, Sinha rises to the occasion. Gill brings a lightheartedness to the movie and Smita Tambe delivers equally well in half the screen-time. This is the great debut that has come seven years into Sonakshi\u2019s career. And for that, you must go meet Noor at theatre.

Since its foundation in 2001, it claims to have raised $4.2bn (\u00a33.3bn) for \u201cgood causes\u201d in 164 countries .\nIt also styles itself as a \u201cfor-profit, for-good organisation\u201d, but those two elements might not mesh together quite as gracefully as its founders would like. The 5% that JustGiving skims off each donation \u2013 slightly more if they are gift-aided \u2013 reportedly amounts to \u00a320m a year . According to its accounts, one director has a salary of \u00a3152,000 plus pension contributions of \u00a346,600. Recently there have also been questions about the provenance of two high-profile appeals it has hosted , both related to the recent Westminster attack.\nCall for fundraising pages to be regulated amid fraud concerns Read more\nSomewhat unbelievably, online donation platforms fall outside the remit of the fundraising regulator and, as reported by the Guardian this week, there are now loud calls to correct such a glaring anomaly.\nAccording to a recent survey by the Charities Aid Foundation , only 50% of us now think charities are trustworthy. On top of hostility to government and big business, the inward-looking sensibilities crystallised in the Brexit vote might be colouring public attitudes towards the so-called third sector.\nThere is a sense of the same sentiments in all that noise about aid spending, now the subject of an intervention by that great charitable icon Bill Gates, who wants Theresa May to stick with the UK\u2019s commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on aid .\nThere again, even if a new public meanness partly explains some people\u2019s scepticism, it may not explain it all. Many may well have more rational reasons: the sense of a world too beyond scrutiny, highlighted by the Kids Company saga ; a reasonable suspicion that high-profile fundraising is often an easy way for governments to be let off the hook, and for wealthy people to draw attention away from their tax affairs.\nBut here is the strange thing. We still give almost as much to charity as we did 10 years ago, and the imperative to dig in one\u2019s pocket has never been more ubiquitous. The shaking of tins on drizzly Saturday mornings is the stuff of the 20th century: now, charity is loud, brash and firmly built into the narcissistic, virtue-signalling world of social media. The unfortunate are helped via South American trekking and polar hikes; venturing to the other side of the world is said to be the most efficient way of helping the needy. Equally, few question the motives of the apparently selfless soul who has put up a JustGiving page or appealed for help via such platforms as GoFundMe .\nMeanwhile, charity increasingly extends to things that once came out of our taxes, with the frontier between the two disappearing fast: NHS appeals for radiotherapy equipment in Swindon , support for people with dementia in Essex , cancer treatment in London , and much more. And whereas fundraising drives for state schools were once presented as a means of funding climbing frames, school trips or specialist sports equipment, donations now increasingly pay for the fundamental things that cuts are putting in jeopardy.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018Help for Heroes is also a symbol of the fact that the state cannot adequately provide for the soldiers it puts in harm\u2019s way.\u2019 Photograph: Sam Frost\nA primary school in Sheffield has just launched a campaign for the \u00a3100,000 it needs to fix its roof . In January, a headteacher from Brighton told the Guardian that every computer at her school was bought via fundraising , and that the proceeds from the annual school play now go on \u201cresources to use in lessons\u201d. In that context, if you have affluent parents and staff who know how to tap the right people, you survive. But what happens if you don\u2019t?\nClearly, a lot of the worthy causes that benefit from sponsored walks, bake-offs and Indian bike-rides can easily be recast as examples of outrageous government negligence. There might be no better example than Help for Heroes \u2013 which nobly assists those who have \u201csuffered injuries or illness as a result of their service to the nation\u201d\u2013 but is also a symbol of the fact that the state cannot adequately provide for the soldiers it puts in harm\u2019s way. Why does such a basic aspect of any advanced society require a begging bowl?\nThe word \u201cnormalisation\u201d springs to mind. That said, some of us are old enough to remember the hardcore socialist values that once damned charity as a get-out for vested interests, and an offence to basic human dignity. As far as I can tell, the basic argument still stands: charity eats away at the idea of a decent life as a basic right, and turns its recipients into supplicants; not for nothing is it the favoured get-out of tyrants, tycoons and monarchs.\nJustGiving is right to operate as a profit-making organisation | Anne-Marie Huby Read more\nScepticism about fundraising may be a sign that some of this critique lingers in the public mind; the pang of unease people feel when presented with heart-tugging appeals might be about something much deeper than the predicament of the people in the photographs.\nCertain economic and cultural changes vividly denote our seemingly endless passage away from the postwar settlement into a much more Darwinian world. Trade union membership declines. Private debt soars. Public housing is consigned to history. And at every turn, what one group of people rely on is suddenly dependent on others\u2019 generosity.\nThat is not to deny the sterling work charities do, or the inescapable compulsion to meet their appeals by reaching for your debit card. What bothers me is the future implied by some of the categories listed on JustGiving\u2019s website: \u201ceducation\u201d, \u201cinternational aid\u201d, \u201chealth and medical\u201d, and \u201cdisability\u201d, the latter with a cutesy little icon of a wheelchair.\nIn the midst of an election called by a Tory vicar\u2019s daughter in which the opposition is trying in vain to land arguments about austerity and poverty, the key question seems more relevant than ever: where is all this is taking us, and who will the bowl be passed to next?\nTopics Charities Opinion Voluntary sector Austerity comment ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-21T09:37:35.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "85e47e5e1b44214252e33386de7c2cd723c42be8", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJlflkfpJSEPvccJDTntXdkv2f4YZymR9.67MfGnuhaiG472prh1sH2S_OfcaG6ZV_dzdyIvrnUGDWyk4jSa7tlyCj3PmYjxGz", "site_full": "www.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/politics/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Politics | Yahoo News - Latest News &amp; Headlines", "title": "US tries to clear waters after N.

Amid soaring tensions ahead of North Korea's apparent ramping up for a sixth nuclear test, the US Navy on April 8 said it was directing a naval strike group headed by the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier to \"sail north\" from the waters off Singapore, as a \"prudent measure\" to deter Pyongyang.\n\"We are sending an armada. Very powerful,\" were the words of President Donald Trump, and other officials made it sound like the ships were plowing toward the region.\n\"A carrier group steaming into an area like that, the forward presence of that is clearly... a huge deterrent. So, I think it serves multiple capabilities,\" White House spokesman Sean Spicer said April 11.\nPentagon chief Jim Mattis said the Vinson was \"on her way up\" to the region.\nFor more news videos visit Yahoo View , available now on iOS and Android . \nBut the Navy on Tuesday admitted the ships were in fact sent in the opposite direction -- away from Singapore and toward Australia to conduct drills with the Australian navy.\nDefense officials said the Vinson wouldn't be anywhere near North Korea before next week at the earliest -- it is thousands of nautical miles from the Java Sea where the ship was located over the weekend to the Sea of Japan.\nCritics pounced on the discrepancy as a dangerous miscommunication, saying it fed into North Korea's narrative that America is all bluster and doesn't follow through on threats.\n- 'It is happening' -\nIt also comes as the White House faces ongoing credibility issues on a broad range of topics including the size of Trump's inaugural crowd, his unsubstantiated claim that he was \"wiretapped\" by the Obama administration and his unsupported assertion millions of votes in November's election were illegal.\n\"The president said that we have an armada going towards the peninsula. That's a fact. It happened. It is happening, rather,\" Spicer said Wednesday as he tried to clarify the issue.\nSpeaking to reporters in Saudi Arabia, Mattis said the Pentagon had tried to be open about the Vinson's whereabouts.\n\"We generally don't give out ship schedules in advance but I did not want to play a game either and say we were not changing the schedule when in fact we have,\" he said.\n\"She will be on her way. I will determine when she gets there and where she actually operates, but the Vinson is going to be part of our ensuring that we stand by our allies in the northwest Pacific.\"\nRear Admiral Jim Kilby, who heads the Vinson strike group, wrote on Facebook late Tuesday that the ships' deployment \"has been extended 30 days to provide a persistent presence in the waters off the Korean Peninsula.\"\nJames Faeh, a former Pentagon country director for Korea during the Obama administration, said the Vinson deployment was not a make-or-break development, given that the United States already has a massive array of military hardware and tens of thousands of troops in the region to deter Pyongyang.\nHe told AFP the rhetoric coming from the Trump administration on North Korea was \"overheated and risky,\" but the strike group's deployment was \"not at all outside of the mainstream.\"\nNorth Korea staged a massive military parade on Saturday and observers widely expected the country to conduct a sixth nuclear test to coincide with celebrations marking the birthdate of regime founder Kim Il-Sung.\nBut that test hasn't happened yet, though North Korean leader Kim Jong-un attempted to launch a missile Sunday that the Pentagon said blew up almost immediately after launch.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links":

Updated 1 day ago Sea Lions In California Are Dying From A Toxic Algae That Ravages Their Brains This is the \u201cworst year ever\u201d for the toxin linked to higher water temperatures and pollution, experts warn. By Mary Papenfuss 1.6k \nAlgae so toxic that it\u2019s causing fatal brain damage in California sea lions is the latest problem plaguing ocean animal rescue operations along the Pacific coast. \nDomoic acid poisoning is emerging as a key threat this year to the animals that ingest the toxin while eating fish and other sea creatures that feed on algae, rescue organizations in southern California warn. \nSome birds and dolphins have also been affected by the algae, which authorities warn can be harmful to humans who eat shellfish. \nThe neurotoxin that the Pseudo-nitzschia algae produces can destroy the brains of sea lions until they no longer know basic survival functions , such as how to evade predators and find food. It can cause sea lions to have seizures and paralysis, while one of the key signs of this dementia is when they are seen rolling their heads repeatedly. \nAnd a spokesman for the Channel Islands Marine and Wildlife Institute told the Ventura County Star that this is the \u201c worst year ever \u201d for cases of domoic acid poisoning. 14 sea lions @PacificMMC have died from algae bloom since April 4. https://t.co/kPxYaaz4J5 pic.twitter.com/6ppFfOI2NW \u2014 Marine Mammal Center (@TMMC) April 20, 2017 \nMarine Animal Rescue has reported picking up 33 disoriented sea lions suffering from symptoms this month alone. \nIn Laguna Beach, the Pacific Marine Mammal Center has reported 14 sea lion deaths so far this month from domoic acid poisoning. Many of the effected animals were pregnant females, primarily because they\u2019re feeding especially heavily now to support their pregnancies. \nRescue centers try to flush the toxin out of an animal\u2019s system, but sometimes their brains are too significantly damaged to save. \nNo cases in humans have yet been reported this year. Commercially harvested seafood is tested before it goes to market, but the California Department of Health sent out a warning last week against eating mussels, clams or whole scallops harvested by sports shellfish collectors in Santa Barbara County. \n\u201cDangerous levels of domoic acid have been detected in mussels from this region, making them unsafe to consume,\u201d the statement warned. \nThe Southern California Coastal Ocean Observing Systems at Scripps Institution of Oceanography issued a domoic acid alert last week off Orange County. \nDomoic acid poisoning was also a major problem 10 years ago , when 175 sea lions reportedly showed clinical signs of being affected. But the sheer number of animals the algae has sickened in such a short space of time this year has shocked welfare groups. \nMarine Mammal Care Center of Los Angeles veterinarian Dr. Lauren Palmer said the group had taken in 15 adult sea lions in 10 days this month that had showed clinical signs of domoic acid. \u201cIt is unusual to see this many in a 10-day period,\u201d she told the Orange County Register. \nKeith Matassa, executive director of the Pacific Marine Mammal Center, called the sea lions the \u201c canaries of the marine environment \u201d because they are indicators of an ocean\u2019s health. \nMany scientists say that the development of the toxin is a byproduct of increased ocean pollution and higher water temperatures that allow it to thrive. With heavy rains this year, more fertilizer and waste water has washed into the sea. \n\u201cWe do know society is shaping harmful algal blooms ,\u201d Clarissa Anderson, head of the Scripps operation, told the Beach Reporter. \u201cWe are having an effect. We are seeing more of them. We are seeing bigger ones, more toxic ones all the time all over the entire world.\u201d \nYou can help sea lions by contributing to groups that help them.

She later says in the trailer, \u201cI went from a billion dollar commodity to on the street.\u201d\nAddressing the abuse of prescription drugs that ended her life, Chyna tells the cameras, \u201cIf I need one valium, I take one valium. If I need three...\u201d\nChyna was an original member of D-Generation X, partnering with other wrestling stars like Triple H and Shawn Michaels. Following her time in the ring, she posed for Playboy and appeared on popular VH1 reality series The Surreal Life , which documented her struggle with alcohol abuse.\nAngra who also directed the upcoming film Portrait of Harry tells PEOPLE exclusively that Chyna was \u201cso warm, so loving,\u201d and calls her a \u201cfeminist icon.\u201d\nView photos\nAngra and Chyna More He says that when they first started the project, he was unaware of the extent of Chyna\u2019s substance abuse.\n\u201cIt seemed like she was getting better, but then every once in a while there would be concerning moments,\u201d he admits. \u201cIn the final months, we flew to Miami to visit her father\u2019s grave, we were trying to deal with some of the underlying issues that she was having.\u201d\nThese moments including a botched reconciliation with her estranged mother impacted Chyna heavily emotionally, Angra says.\n\u201cShe started to drink, and holed up in her apartment and was pretending everything was fine. But the phone calls she was making to me were very worrisome,\u201d he admits, adding that he sometimes wishes he intervened more. \u201cSometimes I feel really guilty.\u201d\nBefore her death, Chyna had ingested painkillers oxycodone and oxymorphone, as well as Valium, nordiazepam (a muscle relaxant) and temazepam (a sleeping aide), according to the report from the Los Angeles County Coroner that PEOPLE obtained last year .\nView photos\nHer former manager, Anthony Anzaldo, told PEOPLE of the documentary at the time, \u201cIt\u2019s her facing a lot of her own emotions and issue. So it was getting a little bit intense for her and she probably was just inadvertently taking her meds a little bit inappropriately. Once we found out that was happening, we knew that there was a problem, and four days later she was gone.\u201d\nAnzaldo\u2019s attempted help is heard in Chyna\u2019s final voicemail to Angra, which he is also sharing with PEOPLE. In it, she expresses her willingness to go to rehab.\n\u201cThat voicemail, when I heard it, I was very excited,\u201d Angra tells PEOPLE. \u201cShe, for the first time, admitted she had a problem... Sadly, that was the last time anybody heard from her.\u201d\nAngra says that Chyna\u2019s unexpected death \u201cchanged who I was as a person.\u201d\n\u201cHer entire life she was searching to feel loved and feminine and beautiful,\u201d he says. \u201cShe was one of the strongest women physically and emotionally in the sports world for the last 20, 30 years.\u201d\nHe hopes that viewers \u201cremember [Chyna] for her strength and for what she represented for a lot of women that didn\u2019t have the voice.\u201d\n\u201cAnd I hope that people can see the signs of people who are going through addiction,\u201d he says. \u201cThey look strong, and they look tough, but celebrities and artists are some of the most sensitive people in the world.\u201d\nAngra and the film\u2019s executive producer Rob Potylo hope to release Wrestling with Chyna sometime this fall.\nThis article was originally published on PEOPLE.com", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://people.com/celebrity/chyna-dead-she-had-been-emotionally-strained-leading-up-to-death-friend-says/", "https://www.erikangra.com/", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VHdQxPckIEmiGRzTVDRU3Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9MzAwO2g9MzAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/people_218/e40642f81e6a81442e0b39745dff56ee);", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/ph16kJjBLAs?rel=0", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OneD7if8ktYZ8sj82Yt1jA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9MjI0O2g9MzAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/people_218/4bd42f7d3937eda30fe6ce8eb10e1241", "http://people.com/sports/chyna-wwe-star-documentary-trailer/&quot;", "https://www.erikangra.com/&quot;", "https://www.facebook.com/chynafilm", "http://people.com/celebrity/chyna-dies-at-45-wrestlers-mourn-wwe-star/", "https://www.facebook.com/chynafilm&quot;", "http://people.com/celebrity/chyna-dies-at-45-wrestlers-mourn-wwe-star/&quot;", "http://people.com/celebrity/chyna-died-from-mixture-of-prescription-drugs/", "http://people.com/celebrity/chyna-died-from-mixture-of-prescription-drugs/&quot;", "http://people.com/celebrity/chyna-planning-return-to-wrestling-before-death/", "http://people.com/sports/chyna-wwe-star-documentary-trailer/", "http://people.com/celebrity/chyna-planning-return-to-wrestling-before-death/&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "http://people.com/celebrity/chyna-dead-she-had-been-emotionally-strained-leading-up-to-death-friend-says/&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VHdQxPckIEmiGRzTVDRU3Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9MzAwO2g9MzAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/people_218/e40642f81e6a81442e0b39745dff56ee", "https://s.yimg.com/dh/ap/default/150604/orb.png);"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chyna", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "laurer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rob potylo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erik angra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sean michaels", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anzaldo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portrait of harry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anthony anzaldo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joanie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angra", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "nsfw", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "playboy", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "los angeles county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chyna", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miami", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-20T17:00:39.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ebc8e3b6608f6025e8000d52615b4646696b19fe", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJ1ig9CILzEJIw1H4P0zVIoFm7b8l25x5eVyJnrWg_mOebrk7Le9FnKOlVTzNMd_c3ji8CjHPZ8fKaFPjtswg7Lw--", "site_full": "www.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/politics/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Politics | Yahoo News - Latest News &amp; Headlines", "title": "Rep.

There are piles of books on his desk \u2013 music biographies, politics, novels, all sorts. \u201cTake any of them,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re up for grabs.\u201d Soon after Theresa May announced the snap general election this week, the former postman turned trade union leader turned cabinet minister said he was standing down after 20 years in parliament.\nThe surprise is that it\u2019s only been 20 years. He might have been closing in on 50 when he became an MP, but his subsequent rise was meteoric \u2013 work and pensions secretary, trade and industry secretary, education secretary, health secretary, home secretary \u2013 all within seven years. Johnson, who left school at 15 to stack shelves for Tesco, has also established himself as a popular TV pundit and prolific memoirist. He is known for his equanimity. And already he\u2019s looking forward to a new life dedicated to writing. But at the same time, he\u2019s fuming about this election \u2013 the timing, the chaos it\u2019s wreaked, Tory broken promises, his own party\u2019s unreadiness for office; you name it, he\u2019s angry about it.\nWe haven\u2019t even started on May. Now he really is spitting feathers. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have agreed to the election. I abstained on the vote. Politically I thought it was outrageous. I mean what she said in her speech, \u2018The country has come together but Westminster hasn\u2019t.\u2019 What? The country\u2019s come together?\u201d His voice is rising by the second, and he is talking in permanent italics. \u201cWhat part of Maidenhead has come together? Never mind the country. And Westminster hasn\u2019t? It\u2019s not Westminster\u2019s job to come together. What was the other thing she said? I actually wrote it down ...\u201d\nHe jumps off his chair, goes to his desk to find this obscenity, and returns quoting scornfully. \u201c\u2018There should be unity in Westminster.\u2019 There shouldn\u2019t be an opposition here? What is she talking about ? And, in fact, she had unity beyond her dreams in terms of triggering article 50. It\u2019s such a stupid, cack-handed way to say she was going to go back on everything she\u2019d said; it was obviously just done to put us into disarray. No manifesto ready. No candidates selected. As well as all the other problems we\u2019ve got. We should have said, \u2018No, we\u2019re not going along with that.\u2019 But I suppose the consideration there is that we would look as if we were frit. Well, we are frit.\u201d\nFinally, he comes to a stop. Frit? What does that mean? \u201cThatcher word. She used it for frightened.\u201d Wow! Alan Johnson is so incensed he\u2019s quoting Thatcher. He really is not himself.\nBut it wouldn\u2019t look great for Labour to complain that it\u2019s unfair for the government to give them the opportunity to run the country, would it? Well, he says, the fact is that it was the coalition who introduced the five-year fixed-term parliament to ensure leaders did not play fast and loose with election dates. And it was May who scolded the cynics who suggested she was about to hold an election. \u201cShe said there are good fundamental reasons why we shouldn\u2019t be dragged at this time into another election; \u2018that it might be good for my party, it might be in my personal interest, but actually this is about what\u2019s good for the country\u2019.\u201d And she was right, he says.\nJohnson\u2019s contempt for May is undisguised and absolute. He suggests she is a coward \u2013 \u201cThe refusal to do TV debates will eventually catch her out\u201d \u2013 with a poor record as home secretary. \u201cShe said she was going to get net migration down to tens of thousands,\u201d he says, \u201cbut it was at record levels last year \u2013 333,000\u201d. Most witheringly, he talks of her inability to perform unscripted. \u201cThe only time she got herself into an unrehearsed situation was the fucking National Trust and the Easter bunnies \u2026 I mean, she took time out to go to the cameras and say, \u2018I\u2019m not only the daughter of a vicar, I am a member of the National Trust and this is disgraceful what they\u2019re doing \u2013 taking the word Easter out of their egg trail.\u2019 Extraordinary. The only time she\u2019s busked on anything!\u201d\nBut however strongly he feels about May, the more profound target of his anger is Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. If he felt Labour was electable he would surely have welcomed the election. Is there no part of him that thinks this is a great opportunity?\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says instantly. \u201cThere is no realistic chance of us winning. Is there an unrealistic chance of us winning in the same way that it was unrealistic to imagine Donald Trump becoming American president or Corbyn becoming leader of the Labour party? Yes, unrealistically we could win if we\u2019re still in the age of unrealism.\u201d\nWhat is Labour\u2019s biggest weakness? He breathes heavily. \u201cLook ...\u2019\u2019 Long pause. \u201cI\u2019ve said enough about the leadership. I don\u2019t want to queer our pitch just as we go into a general election. It\u2019s all on record. I don\u2019t want to reQuote: because I do actually want Labour candidates to do well and Labour to do well, and Labour is much more than this person perched at the top of the party at the moment.\u201d\nJohnson has called Corbyn \u201cuseless\u201d, \u201cincompetent\u201d and \u201cincapable\u201d. Does that not make it hard to ask people to vote for Labour? \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the reason I didn\u2019t stand. I could make those accusations about David Cameron or Theresa May.\u201d\nOf course \u2013 but they are your opponents. \u201cYes that\u2019s true, but the point I\u2019m making is people often vote for parties whose leader I consider to be useless and incompetent.\u201d\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Johnson with Tony Blair in 2006 \u2026 some of the policies implemented under New Labour were \u2018well to the left of anything Jeremy Corbyn has suggested\u2019. Photograph: Richard Lewis/EPA\nJohnson is a youthful 66 \u2013 a dapper man with a fine head of silver hair, a side parting sharp as a scalpel, and a life story that verges on the Dickensian. He grew up in the slums of Notting Hill \u2013 his feckless father was caught in bed with young Alan\u2019s aunt and walked away from the family; his sick mother was dead at 42, and from the age of 12 he was brought up by his heroic sister.\nJohnson brought the heft of his childhood to his politics, alongside the negotiating savvy gained as leader of the Communication Workers Union. He became a bridge between traditional Labour and New Labour, equally at home with blue-collar workers and the Oxbridge metropolitan elite.\nHe says the biggest problem today is that the party\u2019s leadership rubbishes the New Labour legacy. \u201cWe characterise our period in government as a failure. There\u2019s this piety that only the sectarian left care about tackling poverty.\u201d He is quick to defend the New Labour record and has the figures off pat. \u201cWe came in in 1997 and upped child benefit by 25%. We also introduced a \u00a35bn windfall levy on the privatised utilities, which would be considered outrageous if Jeremy Corbyn suggested it \u2013 it was well to the left of anything he has suggested.\u201d\nThen, he says, Labour listened to the people. \u201cTony Blair put it a very good way. He said the will of the people is sacrosanct, but the will of the people changes.\u201d Isn\u2019t that exactly what so many Labour politicians have refused to acknowledge, though? The people said they wanted something different and elected Corbyn. It\u2019s complex, he says \u2013 there\u2019s a distinction between party members and the public. Surely the party would be in a stronger position today if senior politicians such as Johnson had supported Corbyn rather than tried to defenestrate him?\n\u201cHere is a leader who was never loyal throughout. The sectarian left sat down every week and decided how they would vote. They didn\u2019t take the whip from the Labour party, they had their own structure. So, no, we\u2019re not taking any lessons in loyalty.\u201d\nWas the backbench rebellion revenge? \u201cNo. No. The problem has always been about competence. Is this someone who can put a vision before the public that they would support, rather than just activists. It\u2019s about this very important and difficult to define quality \u2013 leadership.\u201d This is a subject Johnson has given considerable thought. There were a number of times post-Blair that he was asked to challenge for the leadership, and each time he declined. Does he regret it? \u201cNo,\u201d he says with certainty. Why? \u201cBecause I knew I didn\u2019t want to do it. I didn\u2019t have the motivation, and [initially] I didn\u2019t think I had the capability to do it. I did think I had in 2010, and if we had done a deal with the Lib Dems, I would have thrown my hat in the ring, but the time passed.\u201d\nIf Labour loses, could Corbyn continue? \u201cNo, it would be outrageous.\u201d Does Corbyn think that? Another painful silence. \u201cThat\u2019s a difficult one. I suppose there is a certain delusion \u2026 there is always a good excuse \u2026 I\u2019ve only had two years or whatever.\u201d\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Johnson as shadow chancellor in the House of Commons in 2010. He was repeatedly asked to stand for the Labour leadership after Blair stood down, but always refused. Photograph: PA\nAs for Johnson, his office is going to take a lot of dismantling. It\u2019s both huge and intimate \u2013 the museum of his life. There are his favourite football pictures framed on the wall (QPR winning the League Cup in 1967), family photos and music mementoes (a poster of the Who signed by Roger Daltrey; a cab designed like the Beatles Revolver album). It gives the impression of a man who has taken a lot of pleasure from life \u2013 and from pop culture.\nHe is still thinking about the possibility of an \u201cunrealistic\u201d Labour victory, and says they desperately need a narrative on Europe. It\u2019s a sore subject for Johnson. He led Labour\u2019s campaign to stay in the EU. \u201cWe still seem to be in the position of representing the 0%. The 48% who voted to remain think we are for leave and the 52% who voted to leave think we\u2019re for remain.\u201d Even though 66% of Labour supporters voted to remain, Labour\u2019s campaign was savaged. Does he think it failed? \u201cWe believed we should have got 75% of Labour supporters, so in that sense it was a failure.\u201d Does he regard it as a personal failure? \u201cYes I did. We were arguing for Britain to remain and Britain voted to leave.\u201d Did he get enough support from Corbyn? \u201cNo. From the people around him we had a terrible time. I\u2019m convinced many of the people around Jeremy would have voted to leave. I don\u2019t think Jeremy did. It was bloody hard work.\u201d\nHe says the public is deluded if they believe May is in control of Brexit. \u201cI hate to Quote: Tony Blair again, but it was a magnificent speech. It\u2019s not Theresa May driving the bus, it\u2019s the swivel-eyed ones. From Farage forcing Cameron to have the referendum in the first place, they are driving this bus and they are driving it towards a cliff edge.\u201d\nHe Quote: s Blair so regularly. Does he think we should simply return to New Labour values? \u201cNo, you can never go back there again.\u201d He pauses, distracted. \u201cThat\u2019s a line from a song. Billy Joel.\u201d He starts singing. \u201cBrenda and Eddie still going steady,\u201d that\u2019s the one. All the things we did for the disabled, civil partnerships, national minimum wage, union recognition \u2013 that to me is the Labour party. Appealing just to your core supporters and having rallies where you can turn out thousands, well Farage can do that, Le Pen can do that. That\u2019s not going to win Labour elections. What\u2019s going to win elections is finding a compelling argument as Attlee did in \u201945, as Wilson did in the 60s, as Blair did in \u201997, and we\u2019re searching for that.\u201d\nJohnson has always been in favour of proportional representation. Would he like to see Corbyn suggest a coalition to defeat the Conservatives? His eyes light up. \u201cIn this election the rules are different. You would normally go into a general election saying we are not interested in coalition. Given that this most crucial issue, our place in the world, crosses party lines, I think in this election, above all, Labour should be saying we are perfectly willing to work with other parties in the national interest, through a coalition if necessary.\u201d Should Corbyn tell Labour supporters to vote strategically? \u201cI would. Where it\u2019s marginal, where you can defeat a Tory, vote tactically.\u201d\nJeremy Corbyn not up to job of Labour leader, says Alan Johnson Read more\nJohnson has to rush off to his Hull West and Hessle constituency. Before he leaves, he has his photo taken. Now, for the first time, he seems demob happy, as he chats away about the subject he\u2019s been itching to talk about all morning \u2013 writing. He has just signed a contract for a new book \u2013 essays on songs that represent his life from the 1950s onwards. Next he wants to attempt his first novel. He says he\u2019s never loved anything quite like writing \u2013 the solitariness, the control, the drafting and redrafting, everything. In 2015 he remarried. The third Mrs Johnson has also made him very content, he says.\nHe poses with his raincoat collar up, and I chuck a series of random questions at him. Was he ever a Mod? \u201cWhat d\u2019you mean was ? I\u2019m wearing Fred Perry today.\u201d Who\u2019s the most impressive politician he\u2019s worked with? \u201cRobin Cook ... his brain, his eloquence, his ability.\u201d Who does he prefer Blair or Brown? \u201cAs Bono once said, they were the Lennon and McCartney of politics; I prefer McCartney by a nose, and McCartney was Blair.\u201d He grins. \u201cGot there eventually!\u201d\nWhat was his biggest strength as a politician? \u201cSense of humour.\u201d And weakness? \u201cSense of humour.\u201d Oh come on, I say. \u201cIt\u2019s true. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t go down well. Like when Tony had his heart problem, I said: \u2018The problem with Tony Blair is he\u2019s got a dicky heart, with Bill Clinton it\u2019s the other way round.\u2019 And it got back to him. That didn\u2019t do me any favours.\u201d\nI ask what he would rather be remembered for \u2013 his politics or writing. \u201cWriting,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s something I wanted to do as a kid. I always wanted to be a rock star as well, and that\u2019s not going to happen, but the writing has made me so happy. But I guess if I\u2019m remembered at all, it will be my background; someone who left school at 15 with no qualifications rising to become home secretary. That is something not done very often is it?\u201d And off he trots to wrap up a life in politics and start anew.\nTopics Alan Johnson Saturday interview Labour General election 2017 interviews ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-22T10:56:44.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3b5e499b3d0c3690d0d16817e0a374765b24e89f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJo9hqRo5dV5.U5FbZWKElZR3LGGATuP693uFATM.cy6fiworptAFhxAj4TfIDyai3ysXT0Q7NfBQ-", "site_full": "www.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "http://news.yahoo.com/rss/stocks", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Yahoo News - Latest News & Headlines", "title": "Forget Sanctions: Exxon Would Like Access to Russian Oil Anyway", "title_full": "Forget Sanctions: Exxon Would Like Access to Russian Oil Anyway", "published": "2017-04-20T02:47:03.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.F7C8Eu_VGnP1uBpVSdVxg--/aD00NjA7dz05NjA7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/foreign_policy_magazine/47afbf5f7fca10f2352b56f11e8ac334", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 992, "comments": 0, "shares": 992}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3b5e499b3d0c3690d0d16817e0a374765b24e89f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJo9hqRo5dV5.U5FbZWKElZR3LGGATuP693uFATM.cy6fiworptAFhxAj4TfIDyai3ysXT0Q7NfBQ-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Robbie Gramer and Emily Tamkin", "published": "2017-04-20T02:47:03.000+03:00", "title": "Forget Sanctions: Exxon Would Like Access to Russian Oil Anyway", "text": "With the simple submission of a technical sanctions waiver, oil giant Exxon Mobil created a potential PR headache for the White House. On Wednesday, the Wall Street Journal reported Exxon is seeking a greenlight from the U.S. government to bypass sanctions on Russia and resume doing business with the country\u2019s state-owned oil giant Rosneft. It\u2019s hard to imagine how the optics could be worse. One of the biggest of the many scandals plaguing Trump\u2019s White House is the FBI investigation into whether his campaign coordinated with Russian intelligence to tip the election in his favor. An unverified dossier alleges that Rosneft may have played a role in the Russian election meddling. And Secretary of State Rex Tillerson happens to be the former Exxon CEO \u2014 who before becoming America\u2019s top diplomat had lobbied the Obama administration to ease sanctions that hamstrung Exxon\u2019s business in Russia. \nThe State Department is one of several government agencies that will oversee Exxon\u2019s waiver application, though a State Department spokesman told the Wall Street Journal Tillerson (who received the Russian Order of Friendship in 2013) is recusing himself from any decisions relating to Exxon for two years. \nThe sanctions were put in place in 2014, after Russia annexed Crimea. The sanctions prevent U.S. companies from dealings with Rosneft involving technology transfer, and also target Rosneft chief \u2014 and Putin confidant \u2014 Igor Sechin. \nUnder Tillerson\u2019s leadership, Exxon paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to lobbying groups to argue against U.S. sanctions and he personally met with senior Obama White House officials a dozen times to discuss sanctions on Russia (though he assured Congressional leaders at his confirmation hearing in January he \u201cnever lobbied against sanctions personally\u201d and \u201cto [his] knowledge, Exxon never directly lobbied against sanctions.\u201d) Exxon figures the sanctions, which have forestalled exploration in places like the Russian Arctic, cost it at least $1 billion. \nExxon is apparently trying to get U.S. permission to drill in the Russian Black Sea; if it doesn\u2019t drill an exploratory well this year, it could lose the concession. But existing sanctions aside, Exxon\u2019s efforts now to get access to deepwater, offshore oil fields is a little curious given the big global oil supply glut and still-cheap prices. Deepwater projects, like the one Exxon is trying to get going, generally need oil prices closer to $70 a barrel to be economic; crude oil has spent months in the $50 a barrel range. (Exxon\u2019s other sanctions-stalled project with Rosneft, in the chilly Kara Sea, would be an even dicier proposition at these prices.) \nBut under the terms of its agreement with Rosneft, Exxon\u2019s Black Sea play could expire if it doesn\u2019t act soon, so it presumably wants to keep the proverbial pilot light on so they\u2019re ready to pounce when prices rebound. \nAnother reason could be sheer competitive pressure. The European Union is granting sanctions waivers to its own companies, including Italian oil company Eni, to explore cooperation with Russia in the Black and Barents Seas, even while the sanctions freeze out U.S. firms. \n\u201cExxon is worried it could get boxed out of the Black Sea by the Italians,\u201d one person briefed on the Exxon waiver told the Journal. \nPhoto credit: ALEXEY DRUZHININ/AFP/Getty Images", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rex tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "igor sechin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexey druzhinin/afp/getty images", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "exxon", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "exxon mobil", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "eni", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "congressional", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosneft", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street journal tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crimea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kara sea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russian black sea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "black sea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-20T02:47:03.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "36e2054427477eaf5ac36e386b89d35de04e2f0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOi9Xt.Q.MAcZHJu0GxkzgryZk6OzF7dey_n_ijacTMxUTYX1lsikP2aY8x60aofE4mjkW.lQHbS.m3y9euUXHwn", "site_full": "www.huffingtonpost.com", "site": "huffingtonpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/feeds/verticals/politics/index.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Politics - The Huffington Post", "title": "Some Republicans Think They May Have A Health Care Deal", "title_full": "Some Republicans Think They May Have A Health Care Deal", "published": "2017-04-20T07:39:19.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/58f81bcd2600003596c469bd.jpeg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 139, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 991, "comments": 96, "shares": 991}, "gplus": {"shares": 4}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "36e2054427477eaf5ac36e386b89d35de04e2f0b", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOi9Xt.Q.MAcZHJu0GxkzgryZk6OzF7dey_n_ijacTMxUTYX1lsikP2aY8x60aofE4mjkW.lQHbS.m3y9euUXHwn", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Matt Fuller", "published": "2017-04-20T07:39:19.000+03:00", "title": "Some Republicans Think They May Have A Health Care Deal", "text": "04/19/2017 11:05 pm ET | Updated 1 day ago Some Republicans Think They May Have A Health Care Deal The reality is they may be even further away from an Obamacare replacement than before. By Matt Fuller , Jonathan Cohn 320 \nWASHINGTON \u2015 GOP moderates and conservatives are nearing a deal on health care that in theory could get the Republican alternative to the Affordable Care Act out of the House and over to the Senate. The changes also might move Republicans even further away from passage \u2015 no one really knows. \nThe deal, brokered between House Freedom Caucus chairman Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Tuesday Group co-chairman Tom MacArthur (R-N.J.), would allow states to get waivers eliminating the so-called community rating provision \u2015 the rule that prohibits insurers from charging higher premiums to people with pre-existing conditions. In order to obtain the waiver, states would have to participate in a federal high-risk pool or establish their own, and satisfy some other conditions. \nIn exchange for that conservative concession, the amendment would reinstate the Essential Health Benefits that were already taken out of the bill \u2015 though, again, states could waive those provisions as well if they were able to show that doing so would lower premiums, increase the number of people insured, or \u201cadvance another benefit to the public interest in the state.\u201d \nThat\u2019s according to a white paper describing the amendment, which is the result of weeks of negotiation between Meadows and MacArthur. While they have both agreed to the amendment, supposedly representing a number of conservatives and moderates respectively, the amendment is still being reviewed by the Senate and House GOP leadership. NICHOLAS KAMM via Getty Images \nAdditionally, with Republicans effectively going back on their repeated promises to guarantee coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, the amendment could lose a number of Republicans who already supported the legislation. In short, even though the Tuesday Group and the Freedom Caucus think they have a deal, Republicans writ large might have nothing. \nLeadership is expected to discuss the amendment on a conference call this Saturday with GOP members, but public opinion might also affect the landscape. Republicans are trying to say their amendment will cover people with pre-existing conditions \u2015 because, first, the legislation still claims those people can\u2019t be denied coverage, and second, because there will be high-risk pools for those people if insurance costs dramatically go up for them. \nThe reality, however, is that insurers would be able to effectively deny coverage by pricing sick people out of the market. \n\u201cThis effectively allows states to eliminate the ACA\u2019s guarantee of access to insurance at a reasonable price for people with pre-existing conditions, in the interest of lowering premiums for people who are healthy,\u201d Larry Levitt, senior vice president at the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, said upon seeing a description of the proposal. \u201cIt seems to tilt heavily towards what the Freedom Caucus has been looking for.\u201d \nRepublicans argue that the high-risk pools would then cover those people, taking them out of the regular insurance pool and lowering prices for everyone else, but high-risk pools have traditionally been underfunded by states and the federal government, resulting in poor coverage and high costs for those who need insurance the most. \nThose concerns may be significant enough that, even with MacArthur\u2019s blessing, the deal does not win over moderates. The concessions also might not be enough for some conservatives, who have expressed issue with Republicans establishing an advance refundable tax credit to help pay for insurance. \nRepublicans need 216 votes to pass their health care bill, and based on statements from GOP members, even with the support of the entire Freedom Caucus for the amendment, there may be enough moderate hold-outs to prevent passage anyway. (MacArthur doesn\u2019t count as a convert; he supported the last bill, albeit reluctantly.) \nThe amendment wouldn\u2019t seem to address the big concerns moderates have expressed \u2015 like raising the cap on how much insurers can charge seniors or cutting $880 billion from Medicaid. These changes are among the reasons that the Congressional Budget Office predicted the House health care legislation would increase the number of people without insurance by 24 million within a decade. \nMany Republicans \u2015 particularly in the Senate \u2015 have said such deep cuts are not acceptable. Just this week, Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) said he couldn\u2019t support a proposal that jeopardized coverage for the approximately 300,000 people in his state dependent on the Affordable Care Act\u2019s Medicaid expansion. \nPublic opinion has also shifted since the repeal effort began in earnest \u2015 and it has shifted decisively against Republicans and their cause. The Affordable Care Act is more popular than ever, and in a recent Pew Research Center poll, 54 percent of Americans said they trusted Democrats more than Republicans on health care, while just 35 percent said they trusted Republicans more. That\u2019s the biggest advantage for Democrats on health care since 2009. \nIn short, some leaders in the GOP conference might think they have a deal, but they also might have just found a way to make the bill even more unpalatable for Republicans, thus bringing Congress no closer at all. \nStill, Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) suggested that Republicans were getting close to a deal. \u201cWe\u2019re in the midst of negotiating sort of finishing touches,\u201d Ryan said Wednesday during a trip to London. \nSign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

(Photo: Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic) More Demi Lovato is feeling very confident about her body these days, as evidenced by the past week\u2019s posts on her social feeds. On Wednesday, the 24-year-old star shared several selfies on Instagram showcasing her curves. Clad in a plunging bathing suit, a pair of sunglasses, and nothing else, the singer certainly looked psyched for some fun in the sun. \u201cSo ready for summer,\u201d she wrote beside a palm tree and ocean emoji. It seemed that her fans were ready too, as the pic clocked more than 1.5 million likes in a mere 15 hours. The \u201cCool for the Summer\u201d singer followed this up with an even more revealing shot. Facing the mirror, Lovato poses in the sexy bathing suit. Basically, it\u2019s impossible to look at anything but her cleavage. \u201cWhy not?\u201d she asked beside the pic. These came on the heels of a previous swimsuit pic that the star posted on Snapchat. Although this one was a side pic, her breasts still managed to steal the show. View photos Demi Lovato (SnapChat) More All these images were a far cry from the notably less seductive pic she\u2019d posted a few days before of her bare legs. \u201cI don\u2019t have a thigh gap and I\u2019m still beautiful the way I am. #recovery#selflove #EVERYbodyisbeautiful,\u201d she wrote. But it\u2019s not just her body that she\u2019s embracing \u2014-she seems to be celebrating her face as well. This week, Lovato also posted close-ups with her freckles in full view. (They are often masked by her makeup.) \u201cSo many freckles,\u201d she wrote beside one of these shots. While she does appear to be wearing some lip gloss and mascara, it\u2019s a decidedly more natural look than the pop star usually sports. These posts all come on the heels of Lovato\u2019s declaration that she feels better about herself than ever before. \u201cFeeling better than I\u2019ve ever felt,\u201d she wrote on April 10 . \u201cIt\u2019s all about self love. Tell yourself you\u2019re beautiful daily. Be gentle with yourself. Eat carbs without guilt and remember that life is too short to worry about what others think!!\u201d That\u2019s no doubt a positive message for other women to hear, but it\u2019s safe to say that \u2014 based on the popularity of Lovato\u2019s most recent pics \u2014 others think she looks pretty good too, thigh gap or not.

Students waved rainbow flags at graduation, and the school hosted events featuring gay authors and artists. So many Chinese were alarmed when a message of intolerance emanated recently from the university\u2019s main campus in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province. \u201cProtect traditional Chinese morals,\u201d said a banner carried on campus by members of the women\u2019s basketball team. \u201cDefend core socialist values. Resist corrosion from decadent Western thoughts. Keep homosexuality far from campus.\u201d A photo of the students with the banner, posted online by the team\u2019s coach on Sunday, provoked immediate outrage, with people across China calling on the university to fire the coach and punish the students. The incident also prompted a broader conversation about discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students at Chinese schools. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story China, which until 1997 considered homosexuality a crime, has grown more tolerant of gay and lesbian people. Still, the country does not permit same-sex marriage , and discrimination is widespread, even at universities. \u201cIt\u2019s shocking to know things like this can happen,\u201d said Luo Yinxi, 21, a gay student at the university. On social media, students and activists called for the government to put in place greater protections for sexual minorities. \u201cThis incident will be over soon, but the scar of it is never going to be erased,\u201d one user wrote on WeChat, a popular messaging app. \u201cDon\u2019t wait until the next tragedy to make up for it.\u201d Activists started a hashtag, #NoQueerNoGame , to show solidarity with lesbian athletes at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, an elite school. Photo A counterbanner being held up by mothers of gay students at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, China, on Wednesday. Credit Lin Wei A group of mothers of gay students at the school took to the streets with a banner of their own. \u201cDon\u2019t let homophobes hurt our children!\u201d it said. They called on the university to investigate the incident. The women\u2019s basketball team at Huazhong University of Science and Technology had a history of harassment against lesbian players, according to students. Ling Bing, a coach of the team, posted anti-gay rants on his social media accounts. Even after the photo of the banner drew widespread criticism, Mr. Ling posted again to say it was a \u201cdouble standard\u201d that gay students could hold a rainbow flag at graduation but the banner held by the basketball team members was considered unacceptable.

He was scheduled to leave later that morning for America to attend his daughter\u2019s eighth birthday party. But instead, the 35-year-old Kara-Murza, a fearless and persistent critic of Vladimir Putin, was suddenly gripped with the knowledge that, for the second time in two years, his life was in danger. \u201cMy heart was racing, I was sweating,\u201d he told Yahoo News\u2019 Bianna Golodryga in an interview. \u201cIt became really difficult to breathe. \u2026 It was really frightening. I knew I only had a few minutes in which I could still do something.\u201d\nKara-Murza called his wife, who lives in the Washington suburbs. She immediately phoned a prominent Moscow doctor who had treated him the last time this happened. Kara-Murza was rushed to a Moscow hospital, where in the hours that followed, the doctors frantically tried to figure out what was happening to his body.\nOne by one, Kara-Murza\u2019s kidneys, lungs and other organs began to shut down. \u201cAll my organs failed within six hours,\u201d he said. \u201cBy that evening, I was in a coma and was on life support.\u201d The doctors inserted a breathing tube. They brought in a dialysis machine and cleaned his blood, seeking to purge whatever foreign substance had invaded his body. Kara-Murza stayed unconscious for a week but miraculously survived. When he was released three weeks later, the discharge papers recorded the diagnosis: \u201cToxic action by an undefined substance.\u201d\nIt was virtually the same diagnosis as before, in May 2015, when Karza-Murza was rushed to the hospital and also fell into a coma. He had been poisoned twice in less than two years. Somebody in Russia very much wanted Kara-Murza dead.\n\u201cI could never imagine this happening \u2014 not to mention to our family,\u201d said Evgenia Kara-Murza in a joint interview with her husband at the Russian restaurant, Mari Vanna . \u201cIt\u2019s unthinkable.\u201d\n\u201cFollow the trail of dead Russians,\u201d said former FBI intelligence analyst Clint Watts when asked at a Senate intelligence committee hearing how the panel could unravel the aggressive role that Moscow played in the 2016 election.\nAnd, as Kara-Murza notes, the trail is a long one: Anna Politkosvkaya, a journalist, shot dead in the stairwell of her Moscow apartment in 2006. Alexander Litvinenko, a defector from the Russian security services who turned on Putin, poisoned in London the same year. Boris Nemtsov, Kara-Murza\u2019s best friend and hero, murdered in the shadow of the Kremlin in February 2015. Denis Voronenkov, a former Russian lawmaker who spoke out against Putin\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, shot dead in broad daylight in front of a hotel in Kiev just last month.\n\u201cI\u2019m the fortunate one,\u201d said Kara-Murza. \u201cBoris Nemtsov \u2014 they put five bullets in his back on that bridge in front of the Kremlin. So many people \u2014 political prisoners, independent journalists, anticorruption campaigners \u2014 have lost their lives in various ways over the last 17 years that Vladimir Putin has been in power. And every time, there is some kind of plausible deniability. Every time, they say, \u2018Oh, we had nothing to do with this. Oh, this just happened.\u2019 But you know there is a kind of very strange high mortality rate among the people that have crossed the Kremlin\u2019s path that defies any kind of normal statistical model.\u201d\nIt is a record for lethality that has not gone unnoticed among U.S. government officials who have dealt with Kara-Murza and followed his case. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt in my mind that he was targeted for his activity against the Russian government,\u201d said Tom Malinowski, who until last January served as former President Barack Obama\u2019s assistant secretary of state for human rights. \u201cWe don\u2019t know who it was. He doesn\u2019t know who it was. But we do know that in virtually every single hit against a journalist or an opposition leader, no one has been held accountable \u2026 and for that Putin is responsible.\u201d\nBut in almost all these cases, there are lingering questions. What was the poison that almost killed Kara-Murza, and how had it been administered? Kara-Murza and his doctors remain at a loss. Kara-Murza was a human rights activist who spent his days in a constant whirl of meetings, rallies and political events \u2014 almost always trailed by various agents of Russia\u2019s security services. He would have seven to eight meetings every day in caf\u00e9s and restaurants. It is, he says, impossible to pinpoint who and where someone had injected something into his food or drink.\nRead More But what is known is that Russia\u2019s security services have a long record of poisoning their political opponents, and they have gotten increasingly sophisticated at it. Some of the substances they use can delay taking effect for as long as a week.\n\u201cUsing poison is a rather effective way of getting rid of your opponents,\u201d said Evgenia Kara-Murza. \u201cBecause in numerous cases, the exact toxins have never been found. So they can say, \u2018He ate something. He got food poisoning.\u2019 It happens\u2026 In the case of poisoning, how would you actually prove it? \u2026 Their laboratories have been known to develop toxins that are completely untraceable.\u201d\nBut whoever did it had miscalculated, ever so slightly. Kara-Murza had booked his plane from Moscow to Washington for later that morning. Had the toxin kicked in just a few hours later, Kara-Murza would have been outside of Russian territory, in international air space, unable to make it to a hospital. The Russian government could disavow anything to do with Kara-Murza\u2019s murder. \u201cThey could say it didn\u2019t happen here,\u201d he said.\nWhat was not a puzzle was the likely motive. Kara-Murza had been a thorn in the side of the Putin regime for years. The son of a distinguished historian, who vividly remembers the high hopes for democracy that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Kara-Murza had in recent years been leading protest rallies throughout his country. He, along with Nemtsov, was a key figure in the protests in December 2011 that brought more than 100,000 people into the streets of Moscow to protest the electoral fraud that was returning Putin to power. He had been a tireless crusader for the so-called Magnitsky Act \u2014 a law passed by the U.S. Congress in 2012, named for Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian auditor who had uncovered a massive tax fraud scheme involving Kremlin officials and ended up dead in a Russian jail. The law infuriated the Kremlin and at first faced quiet but determined opposition from the Obama administration, which feared that the law would upset its cherished \u201creset\u201d of relations with Russia.\nThe Magnitsky Act gave the U.S. government authority to impose targeted financial sanctions against senior Russian officials implicated in human rights abuses. On Jan. 10 of this year, with less than two weeks left in the Obama presidency, the State Department imposed the toughest sanctions yet under the law: It targeted Alexander Bastrykin, until recently the chief of the Russian Federation\u2019s Investigative Committee, the equivalent of this country\u2019s FBI. \u201cPutin\u2019s enforcer,\u201d Malinowski called him at the time as he announced the action. (Among the evidence in the U.S. government\u2019s dossier: Bastrykin had once summoned a journalist to a forest and threatened to kill him over a critical article \u2014 and then joked that he would \u201cpersonally\u201d handle the murder investigation .)\nAlso on the Magnitsky Act list were two notorious former agents of the Russian security service, the FSB: Dmitry Kovtun and Andre Lugovoi. There was a pointed message to their inclusion. Seven years earlier, they had flown to London and, according to a later British government inquiry, administered the radioactive substance \u2014 believed to be polonium \u2014 that had killed Litvinenko.\nThe U.S. government, in short, was going after Putin\u2019s poisoners. And Kara-Murza, for his part, kept up the pressure: Just as the sanctions were being announced, he sent a blistering letter to the U.S. Senate urging its members to review Putin\u2019s human rights record when considering President Trump\u2019s nomination of Rex Tillerson to be secretary of state: Russian media outlets, he wrote, \u201cserve as mouthpieces for government propaganda.\u201d The country\u2019s elections have turned into a \u201cmeaningless ritual\u201d with voting \u201cmarred by intimidation and fraud.\u201d The judiciary and law enforcement agencies \u201care used to punish the government\u2019s political opponents.\u201d\n\u201cIt is not the task for outside powers to influence the political situation in Russia,\u201d Kara-Murza wrote. \u201cOnly Russian citizens can and should do that. But it is important to consider the nature of our current government in the context of international relations.\u201d\nThree weeks later, Kara-Murza was in a coma. He is now recovering with his family in the vicinity of Washington, but he plans to return to Moscow and has no intention of backing down. He is encouraged, he said, by new protests that swept through Russia in March after disclosures that Putin\u2019s prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev \u2014 once Obama\u2019s favored interlocutor for the reset \u2014 had amassed more than $1 billion in holdings , including mansions, luxury yachts, country estates and a Tuscany vineyard, acquired through offshore companies registered in Cyprus.\n\u201cThese were the largest wave of protests we had since the early \u201990s, since the breakup of the Soviet Union,\u201d said Kara-Murza. Hundreds of thousands of demonstrators came out in 84 cities and towns throughout the country. Although physically unable to participate, Kara-Murza had helped plant the seeds during years of organizing work.\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen these people, these young people who came out to our events, who took part in debates and discussions,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the Putin generation. These are the people who were certainly raised and, in many cases, born under Vladimir Putin. \u2026 All they\u2019ve seen is his face for their whole lives on their television screens. And they\u2019re fed up with it.\u201d\nThere will be more such protests, later this month and again in June, he said. And for all his personal travails, Kara-Murza sees grounds for optimism \u2014 a turning point that he is convinced is one day coming, perhaps soon.\n\u201cOne thing that history teaches us: All such regimes end. One way or another, nothing is forever,\u201d he said. Putin \u201cthinks he\u2019s going to be there forever. But he\u2019s not. We don\u2019t know when precisely it\u2019s going to happen. But we know that one day this regime will be consigned to history.\u201d\nIn his hospital discharge papers provided to Yahoo News, Vladimir Kara-Murza\u2019s record show he had been stricken with \u201cToxic action by an undefined substance.\u201d More", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/08/the-rise-and-probable-fall-of-putins-enforcer/278577/&quot;", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/world/europe/russia-dmitri-medvedev-aleksei-navalny.html?_r=0", "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/world/europe/russia-dmitri-medvedev-aleksei-navalny.html?_r=0&quot;", "https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/08/the-rise-and-probable-fall-of-putins-enforcer/278577/", "http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-follow-the-money-and-the-trail-of-dead-1490889366-htmlstory.html", "http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/23/europe/ukraine-former-russian-lawmaker-denis-voronenkov-killed/", "http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-follow-the-money-and-the-trail-of-dead-1490889366-htmlstory.html&quot;", "http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/23/europe/ukraine-former-russian-lawmaker-denis-voronenkov-killed/&quot;", "http://www.marivanna.ru/washington/&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aYhmitnjj9PJbyU8m71efg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9Mjk0/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/b428519b67b7cb69cb41c55a68fd2b84", "https://s.yimg.com/g/images/spaceball.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/aYhmitnjj9PJbyU8m71efg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NzQ0O2g9Mjk0/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/b428519b67b7cb69cb41c55a68fd2b84);", "http://www.marivanna.ru/washington/"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "putin", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vladimir kara-murza", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alexander litvinenko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andre lugovoi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dmitry kovtun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rex tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dmitry medvedev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexander bastrykin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom malinowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "boris nemtsov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malinowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anna politkosvkaya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kara-murza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "clint watts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "litvinenko", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sergei magnitsky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nemtsov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "karza-murza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evgenia kara-murza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bianna golodryga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denis voronenkov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bastrykin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mari vanna", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russian federation\u2019s investigative committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fsb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yahoo news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kremlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. congress", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cyprus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukraine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kiev", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tuscany", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kara-murza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kremlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "soviet union", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-20T13:24:19.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "27f4276842f05d9a88ec3f71df9b9e74202eec73", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_nSjjhUel09Vb8iJZSIhXW66Za1f4f9yTq7vUUDqu_EdAmxS8pZvK087p0MgeP9PRtp_7G8AV..qZuCiRrNJYM7.YG8gj5Jlcr.LumKsZ5_tjBKiSWn2DWPjMO1Na4YiseVl3A.OduMwsiNI4GENh01NvMFjP70f.HtmI.WxQcQgQ-", "site_full": "www.theguardian.com", "site": "theguardian.com", "site_section": "http://www.theguardian.com/uk/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The Guardian", "title": "It's good to hear cycling to work reduces your risk of dying.

But that's not why I do it | Laura Laker | Environment", "text": "I t may not be a surprise to see another study suggesting that cycling to work can drastically reduce your chances of getting cancer and heart disease \u2013 those who ride bikes for transport already know how good it makes them feel. However, it\u2019s perhaps yet another motivation for those who don\u2019t, to dust off their bikes \u2013 and remember some other reasons cycling to work is so great.\nIn a five-year study of 263,450 UK commuters, published in the BMJ , researchers at Glasgow University found regular cycling cut the risk of death from any cause by 41%, and the incidence of cancer and heart disease by 45% and 46% respectively.\nHow much could commuter cycling increase in your part of England? Read more \nThe cyclists in the study were riding an average of 30 miles per week; that\u2019s three miles each way, five days per week. Cycling at a leisurely 10mph, that would take about 20 minutes each way \u2013 a manageable distance for most people.\nAt present only 3% of the UK population commute by bike, while 36% use a car. If we increased cycling in this country to German levels by 2025, we would save \u00a31.8bn in health benefits and \u00a3284m thanks to less congestion.\nAsk anyone who cycles to work why they do it, and they\u2019ll have a story to tell, whether it\u2019s about how good it makes them feel, how they saved money, lost weight, or won a battle with depression. Most people will tell you how enjoyable it is.\nMy commuting story began at university. I remember being astonished one morning when I realised my friend Szilvia had cycled from Finsbury Park in the rain. Getting on a bike and riding five miles in such conditions sounded miserable, but she looked happy and bright, and told me how great it was. \nWe lived fairly close to one another and she offered to ride with me one day. As I pedalled frantically to keep up with her through Regent\u2019s Park, and Camden, it was like I\u2019d grown wings. Before long, like her, nothing short of a gale force wind with pigeon-sized hailstones was going to stop me from experiencing this feeling every day. \nFor the first time in my life I started getting fit. I arrived at university feeling awake, alert, and generally in a good mood. I continued to cycle to various temp jobs around London after graduation, carrying my work clothes in a pannier and getting changed in the loos. \nOn crisp, sunny mornings, I\u2019d cycle through the city feeling like it had rolled out the red carpet just for me. I\u2019d levelled up on urban living: I\u2019d whizz past the stationary traffic and queues for buses and try not to look too smug. \nI\u2019d chat to others at the traffic lights. Often I\u2019d get to places quicker than public transport could carry me. Often it was the best part of the day.\nFitting exercise into your daily routine is infinitely easier than trying to carve out a slice of it to go to the gym. Without even trying, you get fitter if you cycle. It is no surprise that levels of physical activity are declining as fewer people cycle or walk to work. \nIn the cities of cycle friendly countries, such as the Netherlands and Denmark, up to 41% of people commute by bike because it\u2019s easy to do and it feels safe. Decades of investment in cycling infrastructure have made it that way. These countries have learned that most people prefer protected, direct routes on main roads, and low-traffic neighbourhood streets . This means people of any age can cycle, from the very young to the elderly. In the Netherlands, for example, 20% of 80-84 year olds regularly cycle .\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Imagine if the UK was like the Netherlands, where 20% of 80-84 year olds regularly cycle. Photograph: Rory Buckland L/Alamy Stock Photo \nIn the UK, meanwhile, we\u2019ve had decades of car-centric planning, and minuscule levels of funding for cycling. Even though cycling is statistically safe, it doesn\u2019t always feel it , and this fear of sharing road space with motor traffic is the key reason people don\u2019t cycle or stop after trying it. \nThe government knows that every \u00a31 spent on cycling brings \u00a35.50 of benefits , but at present it spends just 72p per person per year on cycling, compared with \u00a386 per person per year for roads . There is huge potential for more journeys to be cycled if that were to change.\nIncreased levels of cycling can bring benefits for everyone, whether they cycle or not. Bicycles take up far less road space than cars and emit no toxic fumes. They\u2019re good for our high streets : on New York streets where cycle lanes were introduced average trade rose by a quarter. What\u2019s more, bicycles are great social levellers \u2013 according to research, mass cycling could increase mobility of the nation\u2019s poorest families by 25% .\nIf a magic pill were invented that could generate all of these benefits, we would be falling over ourselves to buy it. As it is, no magic is required, just steady, long-term planning and investment, and a commitment to the humble bicycle, so that more of us can enjoy the simple, life-giving joy of cycling from A to B.\nTopics Environment Bike blog Health Commuting blogposts   Share   Reuse this content", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "laura laker", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rory buckland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "szilvia", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "glasgow university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook twitter pinterest imagine", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "finsbury park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "camden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "england", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denmark", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bmj", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-20T17:49:30.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ebd89e3e1be15cad29fed0213f77e2b725384b50", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJAyHDu3a0FbYv4l02hIfNt9MmUNWLwyB_shUlyflNWC2ng4Nwr1djcM6Ruw2h4GpdAZoTHd9LLuN4pchoLUvs1Q--", "site_full": "www.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/world/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "World | Yahoo News - Latest News &amp; Headlines", "title": "New Venezuela protest clashes follow deadly unrest", "title_full": "New Venezuela protest clashes follow deadly unrest", "published": "2017-04-21T05:44:04.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.293, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/BqzPLtXoedYyTNe5PHCEeQ--/aD02Nzc7dz0xMDI0O3NtPTE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/afp.com/d7c266f08395dcf9e760ff43ceaa4b2f0643462e.jpg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 987, "comments": 0, "shares": 987}, "gplus": {"shares": 8}, "pinterest": {"shares": 7}, "linkedin": {"shares": 5}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "ebd89e3e1be15cad29fed0213f77e2b725384b50", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJAyHDu3a0FbYv4l02hIfNt9MmUNWLwyB_shUlyflNWC2ng4Nwr1djcM6Ruw2h4GpdAZoTHd9LLuN4pchoLUvs1Q--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Maria Isabel SANCHEZ", "published": "2017-04-21T05:44:04.000+03:00", "title": "New Venezuela protest clashes follow deadly unrest", "text": "Caracas (AFP) - Venezuelan riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets for a second day Thursday to break up protests by President Nicolas Maduro's opponents, further inflaming tensions after Wednesday's deadly unrest.

Mental health advocates say the show tackles the issue of suicides in a potentially damaging way. By Lindsay Holmes Netflix \"13 Reasons Why\" is a Netflix show about a teen girl named Hannah who dies by suicide. Mental health experts argue that its depiction of her death could do more harm than good for vulnerable young people. 6.1k \nThe Netflix breakout show \u201c 13 Reasons Why \u201d has been praised for its binge-worthy, dramatic storytelling. But mental health experts warn that its thrilling narrative devices also make it problematic. \nThe story, which is adapted from Jay Asher\u2019s best-selling novel of the same title, follows high school student Hannah Baker as she posthumously narrates the months leading up to her death by suicide. Hannah leaves behind tapes for people in her life that detail how their nefarious actions ultimately led to her decision.

Teenagers with mental health disorders may struggle to be taken seriously . They could be seen as \u201cdramatic,\u201d or their behavior could just be attributed to their life stage . But mental health is a real issue, and the way suicide is portrayed in \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d may trivialize that fact.

Suicide is painted as an act of revenge. \nThe show barely even mentions Hannah\u2019s potential mental health issues related to her horrifying experiences with sexual assault and bullying. Instead, the way Hannah\u2019s death and the subsequent tapes are shown makes it seem like her suicide was a tool for revenge on the people who wronged her. \nMore than 90 percent of people who die by suicide have a diagnosable mental health disorder.

Mental health advocates say the show tackles the issue of suicides in a potentially damaging way. By Lindsay Holmes Netflix \"13 Reasons Why\" is a Netflix show about a teen girl named Hannah who dies by suicide. Mental health experts argue that its depiction of her death could do more harm than good for vulnerable young people. 3.1k \nThe Netflix breakout show \u201c 13 Reasons Why \u201d has been praised for its binge-worthy, dramatic storytelling. But mental health experts warn that its thrilling narrative devices also make it problematic. \nThe story, which is adapted from Jay Asher\u2019s best-selling novel of the same title, follows high school student Hannah Baker as she posthumously narrates the months leading up to her death by suicide. Hannah leaves behind tapes for people in her life that detail how their nefarious actions ultimately led to her decision. The 13-episode drama also vividly depicts the method Hannah used to end her life. \nMental health advocates say the show should not have shown Hannah\u2019s suicide and have spoken out about the potentially harmful nature of the show . \n\u201cI have watched the show and was horrified at the graphic, sensational ways in which they depicted Hannah\u2019s life,\u201d Dan Reidenberg, executive director of Suicide Awareness Voices of Education , told The Huffington Post. \u201cViewers can understand someone who dies, even by suicide, without having to be so graphic.\u201d \nA Netflix representative has addressed the criticism, telling The Washington Post that four mental health professionals consulted on the show\u2019s material.

Informal egg roll parties were recorded at the White House during the early Lincoln administration.\nDuring the post-Civil War years, the Easter egg games were played on the grounds surrounding the U.S. Capitol Building. In 1876, an act of Congress outlawed the Capitol grounds and terraces from being used as playgrounds to protect the property from destruction. In 1878, President Rutherford B. Hayes officially opened the White House grounds to local children for egg rolling on Easter Monday.\nDuring World War I and II, the events were canceled. Dwight D. Eisenhower and First Lady Mamie Eisenhower revived the event in 1953 after a 12-year absence. In 1969, Pat Nixon's staff introduced the White House Easter Bunny, a staffer dressed in a white fleece bunny costume who roamed the grounds and welcomed the egg rollers and posed for photographs. By 1974 the activities evolved into organized egg-rolling races. The 1981 eggstravaganza included assorted clowns and characters, balloon vendors, Broadway show vignettes, a petting zoo, exhibits of antique cars, and an eggxposition of specially decorated eggs (one for each state). Each egg roller received a goody bag filled with a program, toy products supplied by corporate sponsors, and food- whose wrappers littered the lawn. Since 1987 the event's theme has been inscripted on each egg, and by 1989 George and Barbara Bush added their facsimile signatures. Today the official eggs are given one to a child (under 12) as they leave the South Lawn.\nRead More About Easter in Washington, DC\nRelated Articles Washington, DC's 2017 Major Annual Events Celebrating Easter in Washington, DC Easter in the United States Explore the White House Gardens on a Public Tour Fun Easter Egg Hunts Near Washington, DC Learn About Washington DC's Pro Sports Teams Our Expert Recommends Spring Family Fun in the DC Area 15 Best Places to Go with Kids in the DC Area Top 10 Things to Do in the DC Area Easter Brunch in Washington, DC Spring Break in Washington, DC National Cherry Blossom Festival Best Museums for Kids in Washington DC April Festivals and Events in Washington DC May Festivals and Events in Washington DC Washington, Holidays/Seasonal Events White House Easter Egg Roll 2017: Tickets, Talent & More ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/+aboutdotcom", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/oYzpiARhtxGpQeyrSaU7ax2jwAQ=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/ParkHyattStKitts-58b2e7d45f9b5860466bac6c.jpg", "https://www.pinterest.com/aboutcomtravel/", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/tc9olltZDWIsnC-lpqpHGdcIjOs=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/capitol-building-170402241-58ddb7bf5f9b58468374c174.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/dos5cAktIxswAe8PhAgGW-BdTG0=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/GettyImages-124846685-589394d65f9b5874ee0312d4.jpg", "https://twitter.com/abouttravel", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/XIxTHATVZBzII49_HCZ3uCOW8KE=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/GettyImages-580470451-58b6e55b5f9b58604653eb93.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/gUX0Ao8BKEZApmnFRPG1vqpmBIQ=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/GettyImages-154917476-58b4b0e25f9b5860466f84fb.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/ZiY_kfxwIggjWClkBSXr9ztiwm4=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/GettyImages-148636845-58c2e1fa3df78c353c0c3cdd.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/hqNB_4tRQ2YBIW_e3MxKo5aWMDA=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/Cherry-Blossoms-56a239785f9b58b7d0c80d7a.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/QzeTKXfwH7Sgu3HurED0Aj4EKNM=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/DC-58e3adf23df78c5162fea85a.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/sO6iA4Dph60kcoPv90bMWjaGBiM=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/family-fun-56a239723df78cf772736c6f.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/aboutdotcomtravel", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/RCTKIMw-ogHb-i_rm4-GbKmaMQk=/385x0/filters:no_upscale()/about/White-House-Easter-56a236bf5f9b58b7d0c7f711.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/1if2aEpRLtZ26xItzN7O22tleQ0=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/kids-family.bmp-56a239533df78cf772736b33.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/stCpuzs7mVILFS9xc5p2ltdUfqs=/640x0/filters:no_upscale()/about/White-House-Easter-56a236bf5f9b58b7d0c7f711.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-20T03:12:12.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "85e4b2cb83ccca5b6688e8978d2d098f39c80a43", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxTqL_zg0lpoQSkmIQR6dvqvTEBW2dIihDqnYxn5OtKYhGePE6_zs5PmeYLk8SrvQ5IqAQGVo2CUo-", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "site": "nytimes.com", "site_section": "http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/frankbruni/index.html?rss=1", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Frank Bruni", "title": "Georgia Didn\u2019t Affirm Trump", "title_full": "Georgia Didn\u2019t Affirm Trump", "published": "2017-04-19T21:27:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/20/opinion/20bruniWeb/20bruniWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 98, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 982, "comments": 0, "shares": 982}, "gplus": {"shares": 4}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "85e4b2cb83ccca5b6688e8978d2d098f39c80a43", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxTqL_zg0lpoQSkmIQR6dvqvTEBW2dIihDqnYxn5OtKYhGePE6_zs5PmeYLk8SrvQ5IqAQGVo2CUo-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "FRANK BRUNI", "published": "2017-04-19T21:27:00.000+03:00", "title": "Georgia Didn\u2019t Affirm Trump", "text": "Privacy Policy While there were districts in the Rust Belt that went his way after having gone for Barack Obama previously, there were also districts, like the one in Georgia, where Trump did worse than a generic Republican would be expected to. That\u2019s a big part of why Democrats had such high hopes for Ossoff \u2014 that and the fact that Trump\u2019s surprising election and tumultuous presidency so far have energized progressives and other Democrats in a manner that Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy most certainly didn\u2019t. Are they worked up enough to foil and eventually topple Trump? More to the point, are they organized, disciplined and pragmatic enough to turn the passion of marches and street protests into concrete results at the polls? An outright Ossoff victory in Georgia on Tuesday would have been a resounding yes, but the absence of that isn\u2019t a definitive no. It\u2019s a very loud maybe: a question mark in a situation where many partisans and prognosticators itched for an exclamation point. And many dynamics made this an imperfect referendum on Trump\u2019s performance in office and the mood of the electorate. Prime among them: Ossoff, 30, has real shortcomings as a candidate. Although he isn\u2019t necessarily hurt by being a political novice \u2014 voters often welcome fresh faces \u2014 he can come across as callow. He was skewered in negative ads as a lightweight. And he was embarrassed in the home stretch of his campaign by reminders that he isn\u2019t currently residing in the district that he\u2019s seeking to represent. His poise and stamina will be severely tested over the next two months. So will Democrats\u2019 tenacity. The party\u2019s candidate outperformed expectations in a special Congressional election in Kansas last week, but there, too, Democrats were denied the moment of triumph that they so sorely need after the humiliation of Nov. 8 and the diminution of Democratic power nationwide during the Obama years. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story They remain hungry for it. It eludes them still. That\u2019s the takeaway from Tuesday\u2019s special election, which demonstrated anew that Trump\u2019s considerable weakness doesn\u2019t translate automatically and axiomatically into a Democratic advantage. But if Trump thinks that what happened proves his strength , and that the election turned on his tweets against Ossoff in the final days and hours, he\u2019s sorely mistaken and seriously delusional.

To qualify as skilled, immigrants will need to get a job in which they earn at least the median income. To qualify as highly skilled, they will need to earn at least 150 per cent of the median income. Other changes include a new three-year limit for workers with lower skills.\nWoodhouse said the changes would control the number and improve the quality of immigrants.\nIt is the second time New Zealand has tightened its immigration rules in the past six months and the latest changes come during an election year, when many people have expressed alarm at the immigration rate.\nIn the year ending in February, net immigration reached a record 71,300 people, equivalent to 1.5 per cent of New Zealand's total population of 4.8 million people. That's a big swing from five years earlier, when net immigration was negative as more people left the country than arrived.\nPart of the turnaround can be attributed to the nation's healthy economy, which is growing at more than 3 percent a year and is attracting back some New Zealanders who had moved abroad.\nThe largest numbers of new migrants to New Zealand are coming from China, India and the United Kingdom.

The details of his departure have yet to be worked out, and he was not yet thinking about his life after Fox. But when he turns his attention to his future, he will have no shortage of options. Though his sexual harassment settlements may pose an obstacle, O\u2019Reilly\u2019s loyal fanbase presents a major opportunity to conservative networks looking to grow their audiences. \u201cOur management here is obviously discussing it,\u201d said Charles Herring, president of One America News Network, a conservative cable channel that reaches 35 million households. \u201cClearly he\u2019s built one heck of a brand. Clearly there\u2019s been accusations that need to be looked at also.\u201d Christopher Ruddy, CEO of Newsmax, said he would be \u201cvery open to talking\u201d with O\u2019Reilly about joining the network, which reaches 10 million homes via cable and broadcast. \u201cI think some of the allegations made against him were serious, but he\u2019s never been convicted in my mind of anything,\u201d Ruddy says. \u201cI think he still remains a very hot property in the media word.\u201d Either option would be a step down from Fox, which reaches 100 million households and paid O\u2019Reilly $20 million a year. But Ruddy argues that the \u201cfraying\u201d of Fox News has created an opportunity for other conservative outlets. \u201cI think there\u2019s a lot of players willing to invest,\u201d he says. O\u2019Reilly, 67, also has enough of a profile that he could strike out on his own. After parting ways with Fox in 2011, Glenn Beck launched a TV and radio show on the Blaze, his multi-media platform. The Blaze has reportedly reached as many as 300,000 paying subscribers and is available in 13 million cable households. \u201cI think it\u2019s harder than it looks,\u201d cautions Scott Baker, the site\u2019s former editor-in-chief. \u201cObviously O\u2019Reilly is in a position to do better at that than nearly anyone. But we\u2019re talking about people at different life stages. The question will be how much does he want it.\u201d \u201cMy guess is he loves that idea of being America\u2019s anchorman,\u201d Baker says. \u201cRevenge is a powerful motivator. But having to build something from the ground up, it puts you in your place a little bit.\u201d A less strenuous option would be to launch a podcast, which he could do from his own house for minimal cost. Nancy Grace, who left HLN last year, now does a daily Crime Stories podcast. O\u2019Reilly already has a \u201cpremium membership\u201d plan on his website. Subscribers pay $4.95 per month for access to a newsletter, a message board, and the \u201cO\u2019Reilly Factor\u201d archives. The site is rumored to have at least 20,000 paying subscribers, bringing in more than $1 million a year. O\u2019Reilly could launch a daily podcast or streaming show and substantially grow the premium subscriber base. With relatively little effort, he could replace much of his lost earnings from Fox.

He\u2019s referring to that intensely emotional evening on Sept. 1 last year, when the Revolution reunited onstage at First Avenue \u2014 the Minneapolis club where Purple Rain \u2019s concert scenes were filmed \u2014 and celebrated the life and legacy of their former boss. \u201cTo walk on that stage and play those songs, knowing that he\u2019s not there,\u201d guitarist Wendy Melvoin says contemplatively, her voice trailing off. On that night, Melvoin \u2014 who handled most of the lead vocals in Prince\u2019s tragic absence \u2014 appeared the most emotional onstage, sometimes struggling to make it through songs like \u201cSometimes It Snows in April.\u201d But she says that by the third and final show of the band\u2019s First Avenue residency, \u201cthe five of us felt a lift. There were more smiles onstage for us. There was more playfulness, and you could feel \u2014 dare I say without sounding too New-Agey? I am not really into this or anything \u2014 but you could actually sense that he looked at us and went, \u2018It\u2019s OK.\u2019\u201d \u201cLike kind of a s\u00e9ance,\u201d Bobby adds. Melvoin nods. \u201cIt was weird. And we walked offstage and cried.\u201d Now, more than six months after that historic evening and a year after Prince\u2019s sudden and shocking death at age 57, Melvoin, Bobby, and the three other core members of the Revolution \u2014 bassist Brownmark and keyboardists Doctor Fink and Lisa Coleman \u2014 are sitting with Yahoo Music at the L.A. rehearsal space where they\u2019re prepping for a nationwide reunion tour . And they\u2019re in good spirits, eager to share their memories of Prince. \u201cHe was as you could\u2019ve possibly imagined greatness to be,\u201d says Melvoin, who joined the Revolution in 1983 when she was just 19 years old. (Melvoin\u2019s very first public gig with the band took place at First Avenue, and incredibly, three of the recorded performances from that night made it onto the Purple Rain album. \u201cHe was frantically telling us we\u2019re making history: \u2018We\u2019re making history tonight, this is history tonight,\u2019\u201d recalls Bobby.) \u201cWhen you were in a room with him, he was it . He was ephemeral. He was otherworldly. And he was as talented, or more talented, than what you\u2019d expect. It was jaw-dropping to be around it.\u201d \u201cHe was the \u2018funky Yoda\u2019 to me,\u201d says Brownmark. \u201cMy first encounter with him was at his house; Bobby took me out there. To me, the doors were 20 feet high \u2026 because I was scared to death. He opened the door, and I was like, \u2018Oh, my God. This dude is a rock star!\u2019 \u2014 because I never been that close to a real, hardcore rock star. I was blown away. From that moment, my life changed. My whole thought process of what stardom was \u2014 it changed at that point. I really started to get the difference between who I was and who this guy was.\u201d Bobby, who joined Prince\u2019s musical entourage earlier, in 1979, remembers that even before Prince was an actual rock star, he was a rock star. \u201cFor me, when it started, Prince was very unfamous. We were very unfamous together,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cBut he still had all these magical qualities. He used to practice being a rock star \u2014 like, he couldn\u2019t go into restaurants, or he couldn\u2019t go into a gas station, because he was going to be a rock star and he was going to be famous. He was always projecting himself to be this persona. \u2026 It\u2019s just mind-boggling to think that he conjured up all this confidence and skill. We were all mere mortals. I knew that in the first look of the guy, you could tell he wasn\u2019t a human. He was more of a reptile, or something different in his DNA.\u201d \u201cOne thing that a lot of people don\u2019t realize about him is he lived and breathed what he did,\u201d says Brownmark, who joined the band in 1982. \u201cMy first assignment, before I even picked up a guitar, was in Prince\u2019s living room: Look at myself in the mirror eight hours a day. He would tell me how to stand. He said, \u2018No, pivot your foot that way. OK, now turn your cheek to do this. Get your shoulder up. Bend your shoulder back.\u2019 That\u2019s how he trained me. Then it got to a point where I would be out at a club somewhere and I\u2019d be standing, I\u2019d have this pose, and people would come up to me and say, \u2018Mark, what\u2019s wrong with you? Why are you standing like that?\u2019 I didn\u2019t even know I was doing it. Read More \u201cHe would condition you like that,\u201d continues Brownmark, revealing that the band members even took ballet lessons with Prince, at his insistence, to hone their stage skills for the Purple Rain film . \u201cThe more you rehearse, the more you don\u2019t think about it, the less you think about it. Then the more fun you have, and that was the key to the Revolution. We didn\u2019t think about it. He would throw up these cues, and we knew every marker, we knew every cue, and we would hit it \u2014 just BAM, BAM! We knew right where to hit.\u201d Melvoin elaborates on Prince\u2019s vision when it came to assembling the Revolution: \u201cHe hired these individuals; we came to the picture with singular personalities and self-possessed in our own lives. That translated to each one of our personalities with an instrument. Bobby was always the gentleman and put-together, and that reflected in his absolute pocket, meat-and-potatoes, four-on-the-floor drumming, sturdy. Lisa, the ethereal person who walks on air, whispers when she talks \u2014 her music sounds that way. Matt [Fink], he is like a doctor; he can play his keyboard and get from the left side of the 88 keys all the way to the right side faster than any human being. And [Brownmark] is the sexy, gorgeous, all-encompassing, curious flirt, and that\u2019s how his bass sounds.\u201d Bobby adds that Prince had a \u201cgrand vision\u201d for the aptly named Revolution inspired by coed bands like Fleetwood Mac, racially mixed acts like Sly & the Family Stone, and the ethnic diversity of Minneapolis\u2019s Uptown neighborhood. \u201cWhite, black, Puerto Rican, everybody just a-freakin\u2019,\u201d he quips, quoting a line from Prince\u2019s Dirty Mind track \u201cUptown.\u201d Melvoin and Coleman especially appreciated the band\u2019s sense of inclusivity. \u201cI was very aware that [Prince] loved female musicians,\u201d Melvoin says. \u201cMy being a woman onstage gave him license to be just even that much more androgynous and be more in touch with his own female energy, and I got the permission to be in touch with more of my male energy\u2026 I wanted to be more of a counterpart to him, and he wanted me to be more of a counterpart, so we both got what we wanted out of it.\u201d Still, Melvoin and Coleman can\u2019t help but roll their eyes when asked about the famous \u201cIs the water warm enough?\u201d intro from the provocative Purple Rain track \u201c Computer Blue .\u201d What did that mean, exactly? \u201c\u2019Are you gay?\u2019 That\u2019s what it meant,\u201d groans Melvoin, who was actually in a serious romantic relationship with Coleman for 20 years. \u201cDo you want to get in the bathtub with me, Lisa? Are we lovers? \u2018Are they gay? Are they not?\u2019 He was working that angle.\u201d \u201cThat was another fantasy episode going on in his brain that he got the public sucked into. Sexually suggestive lyrics were part of his early core to the end,\u201d Bobby chuckles. \u201cYou have to have a certain amount of f***ability, being a woman first and not a musician,\u201d Melvoin continues, discussing the objectification most women face in the music industry, \u201cand I didn\u2019t have access to that part of myself \u2014 and didn\u2019t want to have access to that part. But I was OK with the way Prince saw [female musicianship]. I didn\u2019t have much of a relationship to what it really meant in the big picture, to him and his world, but I was honored to be in this band. For me, it was more like: \u2018Oh, my God, I\u2019m part of the Revolution!\u2019 Sure, we\u2019re the chicks in the band, but he\u2019s a Jew, he\u2019s a Jew, and that\u2019s a black guy!\u201d For a while, the multicultural Revolution played in harmony, hitting their commercial and critical peak with 1984\u2019s landmark Purple Rain film and soundtrack. But Prince was already moving on to his next projects, 1985\u2019s more psychedelic (and less successful) Around the World in a Day, and the Under the Cherry Moon movie and its accompanying soundtrack, titled Parade , in 1986. \u201cYou know, before we even hit the first show of the Purple Rain tour, he was already bored with Purple Rain ,\u201d laughs Bobby. \u201cHe really thought that people would be done with Purple Rain \u2014 but as we know now, they\u2019re not done with Purple Rain . He was just moving so fast. It was like next, next, next. But Purple Rain is something that people want to examine for centuries now. I look back at everything, but he didn\u2019t \u2014 he wasn\u2019t very good at looking back. \u201cThe thing about Prince is the hairstyle would change the whole thing,\u201d Bobby adds with a laugh, \u201cand he was already moving into the hairstyle for \u2018Raspberry Beret.\u2019\u201d \u201cHe hated his hair on Around the World in a Day !\u201d says Melvoin. \u201cHe said to me at the video [for \u2018Raspberry Beret\u2019], \u2018I hate my hair; I look like Lou Ferrigno.\u2019 I was like, \u2018The Hulk? He said, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ve got the Hulk\u2019s hair.\u2019\u201d More seriously, Melvoin says, \u201cObviously, Purple Rain was the pinnacle of his, like, \u2018I\u2019m a pop star and these are masterpiece pop songs.\u2019 Afterward, the roots [no pun intended] started going in all these different areas, and he was trying to cherry-pick all these different elements of himself to explore.\u201d And that was the beginning of the end for the Revolution. As the band worked on the double album Sign \u2018O\u2019 the Times , which was eventually credited as a solo Prince album when it came out in 1987, Bobby recalls that Prince \u201cwas starting to become, finally, after being a superstar all those years, kind of like, \u2018You know, I kind of want to do this myself again.\u2019 I was kind of getting the sense that we had become such a huge part of his everyday life that he may have \u2026 well, we don\u2019t know that he was growing a little tired of it, but we\u2019re a handful. I mean, we weren\u2019t just sidemen. We were the Revolution , and we opened our mouths often.\u201d \u201cI knew something shifted our last night at [Japan\u2019s] Yokohama Stadium,\u201d says Melvoin, referring to the Revolution\u2019s final concert on Sept. 9, 1986. \u201cWe were onstage, and he started calling a whole bunch of different people onstage with us while we were playing \u2014 and he hadn\u2019t done that before. And we knew him, and I knew him so well. He wasn\u2019t looking at us. I could feel it. And then we played \u2018Purple Rain,\u2019 and he destroyed the guitar. He destroyed it. And I looked at Bobby, and I went, \u2018It\u2019s over.\u2019 I looked at Lisa. \u2018It\u2019s over!\u2019 And it was over.\u201d Later, back in the States, Prince invited Melvoin and Coleman over to his L.A. rental house for dinner \u2014 what Coleman jokingly calls a meal of \u201cpaper-wrapped chicken,\u201d because the women received their pink slips. \u201cI knew it was coming; I just knew it. I was bereft ,\u201d says Melvoin. \u201cI was like, \u2018 What? Now? Why? \u2019 But you know, you can\u2019t swim upstream when someone\u2019s done. When someone\u2019s done, they\u2019re done. And you just have to go, \u2018OK.\u2019\u201d \u201cHe just had a vision of a different group in his head,\u201d Bobby shrugs. The full, classic Revolution lineup never ended up playing with Prince again, but Melvoin says that after their breakup, there were \u201cyears of [Prince] sending smoke signals for us to get back there.\u201d (Fink continued to work with Prince through 1990\u2019s Graffiti Bridge ; Brownmark says he was invited to join Prince\u2019s post-Revolution band, the New Power Generation, but declined; and Melvoin and Coleman did perform with Prince at the Brit Awards in 2006 .) A proper Revolution reunion will obviously never happen now, but as the surviving members prepare to hit the road, they believe Prince would approve. \u201cHe wants us to play,\u201d Brownmark insists. \u201cHe liked to party, loved to enjoy his music with people. That\u2019s what he wants us to do. Just because he\u2019s gone, he doesn\u2019t want us to go \u2018boo-hoo\u2019 and then go away. He wants us to share while we\u2019re here and enjoy what was.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re going to feel a loss. You will feel a loss,\u201d Melvoin says of what to expect from this year\u2019s Revolution reunion tour. \u201c We feel it. But we\u2019re being respectful about how we\u2019re doing this, in a way that none of us are [trying to be Prince] at all.\u201d Still, even without their leader, the Revolution members are aware that the chemistry and history they share is special. \u201c[Prince] called us Mount Rushmore,\u201d says Bobby. \u201cHe knew that this was something unique. And when you go through this together, the movie, the tours\u2026\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re astronauts. We, like, went to the moon,\u201d Melvoin interjects. \u201cYeah, we did,\u201d says Bobby. \u201cWe left our footprints on the moon.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language":

criticised a new Netflix drama for its \u201csensationalised\u201d portrayal of a 17-year-old\u2019s suicide, which they say could encourage young people to take their own lives.\n\nThe Samaritans, psychiatrists, and mental health campaigners claim 13 Reasons Why could prompt troubled young people to copy the suicide of its central character, Hannah Baker. \n\u201cWe have a responsibility to protect children and teenagers,\u201d said Dr Helen Rayner, a psychiatrist specialising in children and adolescent mental health who is also a spokeswoman for the Royal College of Psychiatrists. \u201cDramatic and detailed portrayals of suicide needlessly put vulnerable young people at risk of copycat behaviour as they see how to carry out harmful or potentially fatal acts.\n\u201cGraphic depictions of suicide may only influence a small number of viewers, but the consequences can be tragic.\u201d\nGed Flynn, the chief executive of Papyrus, a charity that seeks to prevent suicide among young people, said parents and young people viewing the series should \u201cbe aware that when watching this programme there is a danger that suicide is romanticised and sensationalised\u201d.\nThe US-set series aimed at young people is based on a novel of the same name by Jay Asher. Selena Gomez, the actor and singer, is among its executive producers. Its 13 episodes depict 13 friends of Hannah listening to a tape she made for each of them explaining the difficulties she faced that prompted her to kill herself. \n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Dylan Minnette and Katherine Langford in episode two of 13 Reasons Why. Photograph: Beth Dubber/Netflix \nSarah Hulyer, a mental health campaigner, said the show\u2019s portrayal of Baker\u2019s plight was irresponsible. \n\u201cMental ill-health and suicide isn\u2019t pretty and while we need to admit that, we also have a duty to look out for the wellbeing of our younger generations and not encourage unhealthy behaviours. By graphically depicting the protagonist\u2019s suicide method, they\u2019re not helping vulnerable young people; they\u2019re encouraging them,\u201d said Hulyer. \n\u201c[13 Reason\u2019s Why\u2019s] creators claimed they were hoping to \u2018help\u2019 people struggling with the issues shown in the show, but it\u2019s a storyline that is about revenge suicide, demonises counsellors and includes none of the characters reaching out for help and receiving it, it\u2019s not clear exactly what they think \u2018helping\u2019 is,\u201d she added. \nWhile she acknowledged that the show has helped thousands of young people think about the lasting impact of suicide, Hulyer asked: \u201cDoes a show that depicts a young girl who uses her own death to inflict pain upon others really deserve to be put on a pedestal?\u201d \n\nThe number of suicides in the UK among 10 to 14-year-olds has risen from four in 2010 to 10 in 2015, and among those aged 15-19 from 166 to 221 over the same period, according to the Office of National Statistics.\n\nThe Samaritans said 13 Reasons Why exposed failings in the UK\u2019s media regulation. \u201cIt is extremely concerning that a drama series aimed at young audiences can be produced outside of the UK and made available to UK audiences and yet not subject to UK media regulation. This is simply not acceptable and creates a barrier to protecting our young audiences i the UK,\u201d said Lorna Fraser, a Samaritans media adviser.\nThe show\u2019s writer, Nic Sheff \u2013 who has been open about his own suicide attempt \u2013 said he wanted to jolt viewers and make them realise how awful suicide is. \n\u201cWhen it came time to discuss the portrayal of the protagonist\u2019s suicide in 13 Reasons Why, I of course imediately flashed on my own experience. It seemed to me the perfect opportunity to show what an actual suicide really looks like \u2013 to dispel the myth of the quiet drifting off, and to make viewers face the reality of what happens when you jump from a burning building into something much, much worse,\u201d he wrote in a blog for Vanity Fair. \n\u201cIt overwhelmingly seems to me that the most irresponsible thing we could\u2019ve done would have been not to show the death at all,\u201d Sheff said. \n\nIn the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123.

Kennedy and Jackie Photos by Richard Avedon", "text": "\nTo commemorate the 100th anniversary of President John F. Kennedy \u2019s birth on May 29, the Smithsonian\u2019s National Museum of American History will display nine photographs of the 35th president, taken by renowned portraitist Richard Avedon . The above photos and contact sheets provide a first look at some of the portraits that will be in the exhibition, which will be on display from May 25 to August 27. \nAvedon was the only photographer who was allowed to take official photographs of JFK, his wife Jackie and his children, Caroline and John, between the time that he was elected in 1960 and Inauguration Day early the following year. The family sat for this Harper\u2019s Bazaar photo session on Jan. 3, 1961, against the photographer\u2019s signature white backdrop, just a few weeks before moving to the White House, at the Kennedy estate in West Palm Beach, Fla. ( Jackie had already been photographed twice by Avedon for that magazine \u2014 in 1947 when she was voted Debutante of the Year and in 1958 as one of \u201cSix Faces of Beauty.\u201d) \nAfter the photographs ran in Harper \u2018s, they were seldom displayed or published in the years that followed. In other words, not only are they a rare look at a time in Kennedy\u2019s life, but they are also rarely seen.\n\u201cAvedon was at the height of his career\u201d when this brief photo session took place, according to Shannon Perich, c urator at the National Museum of American History. And, though Kennedy was about to be President, the photographer\u2019s style was powerful too: \u201c[Avedon] changed the way we talked about portraiture,\u201d Perich says, referring to the fact that not every portrait features a smiling face. \u201cHe questioned whether portraits had to be flattering or not.\u201d \nGet your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter \nAnd if it seems as if the figures aren\u2019t totally focused on the camera, that\u2019s because the photo session was rather chaotic.\nThat day \u2014 Jan. 3, 1961 \u2014 was the same day that the U.S. severed diplomatic ties with Cuba . Dressmakers working on Jackie\u2019s Oleg Cassini dress for the inauguration festivities were apparently there to work on the outfit, too. As Avedon told Newsweek shortly after the photographs were published, \u201cWhen I took Caroline\u2019s picture with her father, he was dictating memos to his secretary. \u2026 When I\u2019d ask him to look around, he\u2019d stop dictating. But the moment I finished, he\u2019d start in where he left off. I\u2019ve never seen such a display of mental control in my life.\u201d\nBut the photos of the then-future President still manage to convey a warm vibe. \n\u201cThey show him as a paternalistic president, a loving, caring parent, who is going to protect us just as he takes care of his daughter,\u201d says Perich. \nThe Smithsonian would give Avedon a solo show in 1962. In 1966, Avedon donated a set of the Kennedy images to the museum as part of a larger donation of 217 black-and-white photographs. \n", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "richard avedon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jackie photos", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "john f. kennedy", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "oleg cassini", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shannon perich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jackie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "avedon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "caroline", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jfk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kennedy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "debutante of the year", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "national museum of american history", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harper\u2019s bazaar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "newsweek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smithsonian", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "west palm beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cuba", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fla.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kennedy", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-20T02:55:03.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "e61b10b04c020dc4921f7874c188d4c8773150e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJMt_87KWOcQIEDuufYuldp3F3fKA3OnbdcjlEiKjdwvONhYj34NfYiQtUfPYvm_CdAd__qNLCqYFsb_Ep6xwOSKxplzqfKA9T", "site_full": "www.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/politics/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Politics | Yahoo News - Latest News &amp; Headlines", "title": "Trump pummels NYT over tweet on Patriots visit to White House", "title_full": "Trump pummels NYT over tweet on Patriots visit to White House", "published": "2017-04-20T17:50:46.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/bDg_sRmNhUTuuwK73hJ.YA--/aD00OTU7dz03Mjg7c209MTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/1081dcfdc9503ebeebe3166bece76f4a", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 980, "comments": 0, "shares": 980}, "gplus": {"shares": 2}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "e61b10b04c020dc4921f7874c188d4c8773150e9", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJMt_87KWOcQIEDuufYuldp3F3fKA3OnbdcjlEiKjdwvONhYj34NfYiQtUfPYvm_CdAd__qNLCqYFsb_Ep6xwOSKxplzqfKA9T", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Michael Walsh", "published": "2017-04-20T17:50:46.000+03:00", "title": "Trump pummels NYT over tweet on Patriots visit to White House", "text": "The New England Patriots visited the White House on Wednesday.

More By Jihan Forbes. Photos: Courtesy of Instagram. Starbucks's Unicorn Frappuccino has to be one of the most Instagrammable drinks ever . The swirled pink, purple and blue syrupy concoction is just about everywhere, and comes at a time when everyone ( well, almost everyone ) is obsessed with colorful unicorn everything. Indeed, the Unicorn Frappuccino is really good-looking \u2013 so much so that it's starting to inspire some people's beauty looks. St. Louis-based hairstylist Caitlin Ford recently posted a video to Instagram of her giving a client a dye job inspired by the viral beverage. Using Lime Crime 's aptly-named \"Unicorn Hair\" color, Ford fused pink, purple, and blue tones into a beautiful ombr\u00e9 that looks good enough to drink. Watch it, here . Ford's Instagram is a treasure trove of rainbow, Lisa Frank-esque dye jobs , so she was clearly just the stylist to execute the look. Kelly Woodford, another hair stylist from Winnipeg, Canada also gave her client a Unicorn Frappuccino-inspired hair color . Starting with ashy roots with a greyish-purple-blonde tinge, Woodford applied the rest of the colors, creating a delightful ombr\u00e9 effect. She even styled her client's hair into a chignon, and stuck a straw in it, because why not? Who knew a spring drink could inspire the next hair trend? This story originally appeared on Allure .

By Pico Iyer 20 April 2017 \nAn elegant middle-aged man, in a spotless black jacket, came up to me, hand extended, to say hello, and I was startled. My neighbours in Japan tend to be formal and reticent; few of them are eager to take the initiative. And we were simply standing around an art gallery on Kitayama Street in northern Kyoto, 20 years ago, where a handful of us had gathered to see an exhibition of a friend\u2019s pen-and-ink drawings. In the classical sumi-e style, they were deliberately sketchy and full of emptiness; the heart of the paintings was the negative space at their centre, which every viewer could fill in according to his whim or choice. View image of Iyer met the mysterious man in an art gallery in Kyoto 20 years ago (Credit: Chinnaphong Mungsiri/Getty) \nOne of the blessings of a writer\u2019s life is that so many people are keen to tell you their story. But in this case, the more the intriguing stranger shared \u2013 in a calm and fluent English \u2013 the less I could be sure of. He had been born, he soon began telling me, in Shanghai in the 1930s, and when he sailed out of the exploding city as a boy, it was to land in a Japan that was equally desperate and broken. In his late teens, he had fallen in love with the daughter of the chairman of one of the most celebrated companies in Japan and followed her all the way to New York City. But soon her sense of duty and her role claimed her again, and he had to leave Fifth Avenue, alone. \nOne of the blessings of a writer\u2019s life is that so many people are keen to tell you their story. \nBefore much longer, he was on the West Coast, at art school, he said, just as the Summer of Love was coming to a climax. I didn\u2019t know quite what to make of any of this \u2013 there was no mention of a family, a home where he lived now, anything resembling a job \u2013 but I wasn\u2019t surprised when a common friend told me that Shinsuke was a classical archer: He carried himself with the straight-backed clarity of a traditional master. \nOur conversation ended, and I didn\u2019t see Shinsuke for many years. But when my wife and I got married, two years after that chance encounter in the art gallery, suddenly a huge, Rothko-worthy colour field painting \u2013 one enigmatic red square, one enigmatic black one \u2013 arrived on our doorstep. Shinsuke, whom I\u2019d met just once, had heard of our union and wanted to honour it, and he did so with the most arresting wedding present we were to receive. View image of Shinsuke wrote letters to Iyer for the rest of his life (Credit: Chiara Salvadori/Getty) \nMany years on, the phone rang in our generally quiet apartment. \u201cI do hope I\u2019m not disturbing you,\u201d said a deep voice, not quite Japanese, and not quite not, \u201cbut I am coming to Nara, and I wonder if you might have an hour free?\u201d When I arrived at the station, Shinsuke was seated in a caf\u00e9, with a book, in a beret, looking every inch the artist in Paris that, I was now to learn, he had been for many years. \nThe beauty of a haiku is that it doesn\u2019t have to spell much out. \nWe walked among the 1,200 wild deer who govern central Nara, about 45km south of Kyoto, and my new friend, always courteous and quiet, opened himself up again in a few bold, intimate strokes. He came from a samurai family, he said, and his father always took great pains not to show emotion. Even at his death, he\u2019d told his son nothing. He himself, Shinsuke continued, had a deep interest in shamanism and would be happy to introduce me to an old female mystic who was a distant member of the imperial family. When we parted, he handed me a card that contained just his name and that of the small island outside Tokyo on which he lived \u2013 with, he said, a beautiful young woman he took strange pains to refer to as his \u2018adopted daughter\u2019. \nIn any other circumstance, I\u2019d have been sceptical: The more savoury the details a writer hears, the more he\u2019s likely to be on alert. Mystification is the opposite of real mystery. But my friends who knew Shinsuke well assured me that none of his story was false; like most Japanese people, especially of his refined background, he was not given to exaggeration or self-promotion. View image of Iyer: \"I learned a little more about a culture in which the truest sign of intimacy is not needing to say a thing\u201d (Credit: Credit: Glowimages/Getty) \nMore years passed, and I heard that my mysterious friend had been airlifted out of his island after what sounded like a heart attack. But he kept on, as he\u2019d graciously requested my permission to do, sending me letters, written in a calligraphic hand that covered barely two suggestive sentences on each small rectangle of paper, as if this son of a samurai were eager not to make the same mistake as his self-enclosed father. \nAnd then one day there came a call and a courteous apology: Shinsuke was back in Nara, this time with a young woman he was to introduce as his best friend\u2019s daughter. But the woman called him her \u2018guru\u2019 and they looked far closer than any college girl and elderly honorary godfather might be expected to be. As we sat in a dark, near-silent restaurant \u2013 all partitions and soft lanterns \u2013 Shinsuke abruptly stood up and stole away. \nWhen he came back, the bill was paid. \u201cI just sold a painting,\u201d he insisted, \u201cand I want to give you something in return.\u201d For what, I wondered? All he would say was that he\u2019d read an old book of mine on Japan, twice, and wanted to repay the debt.

The beauty of a haiku is that it doesn\u2019t have to spell much out. \nThen I received a call again, and it was that confident but unpresuming voice, apologising for the disturbance. \n\u201cHow are you?\u201d I said. \n\u201cI\u2019m dead,\u201d Shinsuke replied. \nHe heard the pause at the other end and chuckled. \n\u201cI mean, I died last week. I stopped breathing; they thought I was gone. But then they pumped me full of drugs, and now I\u2019m okay. Not myself; not in your world. I\u2019m having some quite interesting visions.\u201d \nThat didn\u2019t give me much to say in return, but Shinsuke had always had the gift of carrying himself as if in a parallel universe. \n\u201cTake care,\u201d I said, after we chatted for a while. \u201cAnd please give me a call as soon as you\u2019re out of the hospital.\u201d View image of Iyer: \u201cShinsuke had given me the most startling post-wedding present I ever received: the living, seldom-seen (Credit: Credit: Drazen_/Getty) \nBut the next call I got, one week later, reported that Shinsuke, apparently a well-known painter as renowned for his elegance as for his mastery of both Eastern and Western forms, was dead. \nMy friend, a human haiku, always told me just enough to remind me of all I didn\u2019t and could never know. \nNow, some years later, he whispers inside me as few of the Japanese among whom I\u2019ve lived for almost 30 years ever do \u2013 in part because our every meeting came out of nowhere, except what seemed like the imagination; and in part because my friend, a human haiku, always told me just enough to remind me of all I didn\u2019t and could never know.

Maria Stuart/RedBlkGrl Red.Blk.Grl. formally launched on April 1. \nWhile black Americans are regularly left out of mainstream literary landscapes, when we are afforded racial representation, it\u2019s sometimes limited to tiresome archetypes and narratives. \nPersonal trainer, vlogger and mother Maria Stuart has created an antidote to this issue, at least within the young adult (YA) genre with Red.Blk.Grl. , a subscription box she launched on April 1. She\u2019s one of many black entrepreneurs who\u2019ve recently made efforts to make quality books more accessible to the black community. \n\u201cBlack girls deserve to read about themselves in books,\u201d she told the Huffington Post on Monday. \u201cI want to reach all the bookworms, be they teens or adults and put black YA books written by black women in their hands.\u201d \nThe Red.Blk.Grl. box, which currently has 85 subscribers and is targeted towards young black girls, contains one book as well as additional products, which can be anything self-care items to snacks, that are inspired by the book\u2019s themes. Stuart did a soft launch of the box in January by creating an Instagram account to see if people would respond to the concept of Red.Blk.Grl. Maria Stuart/RedBlkGrl Thus far, the box has 85 subscribers. \nTo emphasize the necessity of the box, Stuart, who is also an aspiring YA writer, mentioned a study conducted by the Cooperative Children\u2019s Book Center (CCBC). According to CCBC, only 278 of the 3,400 children\u2019s books published in 2016 were about black characters. Only 33 percent of those books were by black authors. \n\u201cRepresentation matters... In high school, there is much assigned reading in literature classes, and [black girls] have no choice over what they read,\u201d she said. \n\u201cI recall having a strong desire to find a book with characters that truly felt and thought like me,\u201d she continued. \u201cI often could find something close to it, but there was a constant sense that something was missing from books where none of the characters were black.\u201d \nBut in some YA books that do contain black characters, Stuart said the themes are often repetitive. \n\u201cI think the typical idea when it comes to black YA are things like escaping slavery, overcoming Jim Crow or even gritty urban tales filled with drugs and sex, \u201d Stuart said. \u201cI want to offer more contemporary books that still deal with realities of life, but also that offer sci-fi and afro-futurism,\u201d she continued. \u201cEach book selected must have main characters who demonstrate resilience, who are or learn to be self-reliant .\u201d \nWhile you have to be a subscriber of Red.Blk.Grl. to know which books these narratives will be reflected in, you can sign up for the boxes here .

Sexual harassment is interwoven with power imbalances, and those who experience it are usually subordinate in rank, status and importance to a company\u2019s bottom line. The impunity of powerful men has long been a deterrent to women taking action.\n Women at Fox News and beyond have watched as the company has lurched toward pushing out \u2014 for the same reasons \u2014 two men integral to its success : Roger Ailes , its former chairman, and Mr. O\u2019Reilly, whose viewership continued to soar in the face of public disclosure of the sexual harassment settlements.\nAs Alisyn Camerota, a CNN anchor who for years co-hosted a show at Fox News, said on Thursday : \u201cIt was Roger Ailes\u2019 fiefdom. He was the king. There was no higher authority that you could ever go to and there was harassment. And I tried, in my own way, to raise the flag and to talk to people about it. I went to my superiors to talk to them about it and there was certainly a feeling of \u2018this is Roger, what are you going to do? Who are you going to go to?\u2019 \u201d\nMr. Ailes and Mr. O\u2019Reilly have denied the accusations against them. In both cases, the sons of Fox\u2019s founder, Rupert Murdoch, had to coax their father to act even after internal investigations turned up more evidence of a toxic culture for women at the company. Female employees reported being pressed to trade sexual favors for advancement and endure explicit sex talk, groping, and more. Two settlements with Mr. O\u2019Reilly took place after the company had publicly pledged it would no longer tolerate such behavior.\nPhoto Wendy Walsh, right, a former guest on Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show, who made allegations against him. Credit Kevork Djansezian/Reuters It\u2019s also notable that women are scarce at the senior levels of Fox News, on or off the air. Rupert Murdoch took over leadership of Fox News after Mr. Ailes was forced out . Megyn Kelly, its most visible female anchor, left the network partly because of Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s public condemnations of women who had complained about sexual harassment, and because she grew skeptical that Fox\u2019s culture would change. The replacement for Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show is hosted by a man, Tucker Carlson, and most of the other shows in the prime time lineup feature men, with the exception of Kimberly Guilfoyle and Dana Perino, still outnumbered by men on \u201cThe Five.\u201d\nJudging from more than 950 comments posted on Facebook after The New York Times asked women for their assessment of Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s departure, many doubted that this heralded a new era for Fox or would encourage more women to report sexual harassment.\n\u201cI\u2019m glad pressure was put on the network but no... this does not show men in power will be held accountable.

Privacy Policy And Mairead O\u2019Grady commented: \u201cThe issue of sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace will not be resolved until we have a diverse work force \u2014 at all levels of the corporate world. There is little hope that claims of mistreatment will be handled fairly with the astonishing imbalance of power between men and women at work. When you know that reporting an issue puts your career at risk, exposes you to possible retaliatory actions, and potentially could sideline you at that organization you think twice about whether it\u2019s worth it.\u201d\nSome women defended Mr. O\u2019Reilly, sensing a liberal conspiracy and saying the accusations were unproven. Others said they remained discouraged that a man who boasted of forcing himself on women had been elected president. \u201cThis isn\u2019t really a win for women,\u201d said Lynn Thompson. \u201cThis was done to satisfy advertisers, not because it was the right thing to do. Men in powerful positions will continue to taken advantage of women and women will be seen as liars if they report it. We elected a man who admitted to assaulting women and much of the public doesn\u2019t care. Kind of speaks for itself.\u201d\nMany women recounted their own experiences of sexual harassment in the workplace.\n\u201cI\u2019m in the ad industry, and things haven\u2019t changed all that much,\u201d Michelle Barlow Dickens wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s still Mad Men, only a little more covert.\u201d Patty Ryan told of witnessing a judge press women against a wall and stick his tongue in their mouths.\n Fox was forced to act in the end because its treatment of women was exacting a cost it could not bear. The more than 50 advertisers who pulled ads did so, they said, because they could not afford to alienate women and their considerable purchasing power. It was bad for their brands to be associated with Mr. O\u2019Reilly. 21st Century Fox\u2019s stock price fell 6 percent during the O\u2019Reilly scandal. It\u2019s not that Fox\u2019s revenue suffered \u2014 Mr. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s viewers remained loyal and many advertisers redirected their ads to other Fox shows \u2014 but investors feared longer term reputational damage.\n21st Century Fox wants to buy a majority stake in Sky News and feared that the O\u2019Reilly case might draw renewed scrutiny from British regulators. The company was forced to drop its bid during a previous phone hacking scandal by one of its British newspapers.\nSome women were heartened that they could redress the power imbalance. \u201cWhen we as consumers and voters exercise our power we can force change,\u201d Geneta Miles wrote. \u201cIf corporations and politicians understand that women today will no longer accept these deplorable behaviors, they will change or be defeated.\u201d\nAccusations of sexual harassment are hardly limited to Fox, as recent cases at Uber and several other companies show. The same research suggests that meaningful changes to a corporate culture do not take place unless its most senior executives fully embrace and embody a commitment to rooting out sexual harassment.

United States is as vulnerable to an attack today as it was the morning of Sept. 11, 2001. Information in the press about national security is misleading or flat-out wrong, offering a false sense of security. The men and women of the Department of Homeland Security perform heroic work day and night for a largely ungrateful nation. If members of Congress are unhappy with the Trump administration\u2019s crackdown on illegal immigration, they should pass new laws or \u201cshut up.\u201d Those were the main takeaways from Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly\u2019s first extensive remarks about how he intends to lead a vast bureaucracy on the front lines of immigration enforcement, passenger screening and cybersecurity. \u201cMake no mistake,\u201d he said Tuesday during a speech at George Washington University. \u201cWe are in fact a nation under attack.\u201d Of course it is necessary to take seriously threats from extremist groups and criminals, and take measures against them. But they do not justify Mr. Kelly\u2019s incendiary message to his work force. The tone he sets can only encourage abusive behavior among his officers further down the chain of command against immigrants, and also lead to the curtailment of Americans\u2019 civil liberties and privacy. Mr. Kelly said that Americans have grown complacent because their government has done such a good job of keeping them safe. The reality, he warned, is quite different: \u201cWe are under attack from terrorism both within and outside of our borders. These men and women are without conscience, and they operate without rules. They despise the United States, because we are a nation of rights, of laws and of freedoms. They have a single mission, and that is our destruction.\u201d \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story That apocalyptic talk turns the Islamophobia and immigrant scapegoating that turbocharged the Trump campaign into marching orders for federal law enforcement agents and bureaucrats. It ignores that the United States has spent billions of dollars over the past 15 years greatly enhancing its intelligence collection capabilities and that it has put in place far more stringent mechanisms to screen visa applicants and visitors.

Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed Just compare the inclusive if dull message you hear from corporations with the state of our political culture, where the vilifying of enemies (the elite, welfare queens, the deplorables) is still a critical tool. Donald Trump won an election despite the creepy predatory comments he made on the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape. But Mr. O\u2019Reilly is being shown the door for acting toward women exactly as Mr. Trump had suggested (\u201cWhen you\u2019re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.\u201d). Not that he needed the encouragement, apparently. Steve King, a five-time congressman from Iowa, has plagued the public arena for years with his barely concealed white nationalism. By contrast, when Donald Sterling, the longtime owner of the Los Angeles Clippers, was heard on tape disparaging African-Americans, the N.B.A. revoked his right to ownership and put the team up for auction. The N.B.A. did this even though Mr. Sterling was speaking in private about associates of his ex-girlfriend, who secretly taped him as part of an extortion plot. In the 1980s and \u201990s, companies were more likely to fold under pressure from conservative groups policing the airwaves. \u201cWe are in business to make friends,\u201d said a Coca-Cola spokesman after the company pulled ads from the Fox show \u201cMarried \u2026 With Children.\u201d Today, companies have been pushed in a much more progressive direction, largely because they build their brand on consistent messages not just on television, but also on YouTube and social media. The sheer ubiquity of corporate branding (\u201cJust Do It,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Lovin\u2019 It\u201d) turns consumers into what business scholars call \u201csecondary stakeholders,\u201d people with no financial stake in a company who nevertheless have an interest in the brand.

By Nick Wing 930 \nWeed is in the air this 4/20, and not just literally. Sixty-one percent of Americans are now in favor of legalizing marijuana for recreational use, according to a CBS News poll released Thursday. \nThat\u2019s the highest mark this particular poll has ever found, and it\u2019s not an outlier . Similar surveys taken over the past year have shown that public support for legal cannabis is higher now than it has ever been before. \nWidespread acceptance of legalization \u2015 itself a rejection of the longstanding federal prohibition on marijuana \u2015 is a relatively new phenomenon in the U.S. The nation first reached majority support for legalizing weed in 2013, when polls showed slightly more than 50 percent of Americans favoring the move. Although approval fluctuated somewhat after that, a number of surveys conducted over the past year have shown support for legal recreational marijuana crossing the 60 percent threshold, with fewer and fewer Americans expressing opposition. \nJust 33 percent of respondents oppose legalizing marijuana, according to the most recent CBS poll. Support for legal medical marijuana was overwhelming, with 88 percent of respondents expressing approval. \nThere continues to be a significant generational divide in support for legalization. Thirty-seven percent of respondents over age 65 support legal marijuana, compared to at least 60 percent of respondents from all other age groups. \nAlthough the issue of legalization continues to split along partisan lines, the poll found that 46 percent of Republicans support the move and that 49 percent oppose it. Sixty-eight percent of Democrats and 64 percent of independents support legal weed. The Washington Post via Getty Images \nThe growing acceptance of legal marijuana comes as states continue to challenge the federal government\u2019s insistence that marijuana is a dangerous drug with no therapeutic value and a high potential for abuse. Eight states and Washington, D.C., have now approved cannabis for recreational use, although sales remain banned in the nation\u2019s capitol. A total of 29 states have legalized marijuana for medical purposes , with the latest addition coming this week in West Virginia. \nIt\u2019s not clear if the government is getting the message. Attorney General Jeff Sessions \u2015 who has stated his personal opposition to weed \u2015 has worried some marijuana advocates with ominous comments about the supposed dangers of loosening restrictions on the nation\u2019s favorite illicit substance. \nSessions likely won\u2019t have much public support if he pushes back against state marijuana laws, however. According to the CBS poll, 71 percent of Americans would oppose the government taking action to try to stop the sale and use of marijuana in these states. \nCBS surveyed 1,011 adults between April 11 and April 15, using live interviewers to reach both landlines and cell phones.

A new college course presents Appalachian history through Ms. Parton\u2019s life. Credit Gary Settle/The New York Times The first thing you need to know is that this is no easy elective. If you want to learn about the country music superstar Dolly Parton, you\u2019d better come prepared.\nA course called Dolly\u2019s America at the University of Tennessee \u2019s main campus in Knoxville is devoted to the life story of Ms. Parton, who hails from nearby Sevier County in the eastern part of the state.\nBut this is much more than a surface-level study of a popular musician, said Lynn Sacco, the associate professor who teaches the course. It\u2019s a thesis seminar meant for history students in the honors program, and it\u2019s meant to give students a new way of understanding Appalachia\u2019s modern history and Ms. Parton\u2019s role in it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really kind of a nerdy class,\u201d Dr. Sacco said.\nThe second thing you need to know is that for many natives of eastern Tennessee, Ms. Parton, 71, is known for much, much more than just music. She is an icon for a place that outsiders can sometimes underestimate, said Carson Hollingsworth, the student body president at the University of Tennessee Knoxville.\n \u201cI think there are some stereotypes associated with the area, especially in rural Appalachia,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s great that we have a figure like Dolly Parton who comes from the area and is able to shed light on it and be an ambassador.\u201d\nContinue reading the main story The course, which was taught for the first time last year and will be taught again in the fall, gained attention when Ms. Parton herself tweeted about it last week.\nFrom the girl voted in High School 'least likely to succeed' this sure is a blessing! https://t.co/3EnB8ixB4f\n\u2014 Dolly Parton (@DollyParton) April 10, 2017 Through her representatives, Ms. Parton declined an interview.\nAccording to Dr. Sacco\u2019s syllabus, the seminar looks at a history of the 20th century not from the vantage point of elites, but through the eyes of Ms. Parton, \u201ca poor white girl born in midcentury Appalachia.\u201d\nIt has a wealth of reading materials, including Ms. Parton\u2019s own 1994 book, \u201c Dolly: My Life and Other Unfinished Business ,\u201d and a slew of contemporary articles from periodicals such as The Tennessee Magazine , The Knoxville News Sentinel and The New York Times . Their topics range from child labor in the early 20th century to the Kennedy-era Appalachian Regional Commission and modern economic anxiety in the region.\nGet the Morning Briefing by Email What you need to know to start your day, delivered to your inbox Monday through Friday.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

Privacy Policy The syllabus also includes plenty of videos of historic footage from YouTube .\nThe Moonshiner / 1904 Video by History VA Ms. Parton, born to a poor family in Sevier County in 1946, was only a child when she started singing at local television and radio stations. She moved to Nashville right after high school to pursue a music career. In 1974, she scored four number one hits on the Billboard country chart \u2013 including \u201c Jolene \u201d and \u201c I Will Always Love You \u201d \u2014 and she hasn\u2019t stopped, winning awards, for singing, songwriting and acting, that include Kennedy Center Honors in 2006 and a Grammy lifetime achievement award in 2011.\nDr. Sacco, who is from Chicago and moved to Tennessee in 2004, said she was struck by the ardor of Ms. Parton\u2019s fan base in Tennessee. \u201cShe is beloved here,\u201d she said. \u201cIf she would run for governor, no one would oppose her.\u201d\nMs. Parton\u2019s Dollywood theme park, about an hour\u2019s drive from the Knoxville campus, is a popular attraction in the region, pulling millions of visitors annually to the Smoky Mountains. \u201cYou want to feel like you\u2019re doing something good,\u201d Ms. Parton said to The Tennessean during a 2015 visit to the park. \u201cI really feel proud as a citizen of this area, and just being a daughter of the hills here.\u201d\nThe university, in particular, has close ties to the country star: It awarded her an honorary doctoral degree in 2009.\n During that ceremony, she took the stage in a sparkling, tasseled pink dress to perform songs and to give a commencement speech. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful for my life, but if I had but one wish for you, it would be for you to dream more,\u201d she said.\nDolly Parton Delivers Commencement Address at the University of Tennessee 2009 Video by University of Tennessee, Knoxville Then Ms. Parton changed into a tailor-made, figure-hugging black robe to accept her honorary degree.\nMs. Parton is also known for her philanthropic work. Some call her \u201cThe Book Lady\u201d for her program, called Imagination Library, which distributes free books through the mail to children.\nAs recently as December, she hosted a three-hour telethon to raise millions of dollars after a wildfire raged through Sevier County , killing 14. Ms. Parton promised $1,000 a month , for up to six months, to families displaced by the blaze.\n\u201cShe did a lot of work with relief efforts here,\u201d said Mr. Hollingsworth. \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of country music, but I\u2019m a big fan of her.\u201d\nThe university said 87 percent of its undergraduate population is from Tennessee. \u201cUsing pop culture as a way to talk about how to use history sources was actually the goal of the course,\u201d Dr. Sacco said.\n\u201cBut the personal part is for students to see that history is not just about dead presidents. It\u2019s one way for them to tie in a lot of personal feelings about coming from East Tennessee, from Appalachia.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english",

Jason Chaffetz Denies Scandal Speculation After Saying He May Leave Congress Early The head of the House Oversight Committee said there's no secret to why he's quitting. 1.2k 170 Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), who stunningly announced this week that he won\u2019t seek re-election and may leave office before his term ends, strongly denied he\u2019s quitting because of some as-yet undisclosed scandal. \u201c Not in any way shape or form ,\u201d Chaffetz, chair of the House Oversight Committee, said in an interview with Politico. \u201cI\u2019ve been given more enemas by more people over the last eight years than you can possibly imagine,\u201d he continued. \u201cFrom the Secret Service to the Democratic Party. I am who I am. If they had something really scandalous, it would\u2019ve come out a long, long time ago.\u201d Chaffetz made the shock announcement this week that he won\u2019t run for re-election next year, or be \u201ca candidate for any office\u201d in 2018. In the days since, he said he may not even finish out his current term. \u201cIf I do step down early, it will be months from now,\u201d Chaffetz told The Wall Street Journal. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for people to believe, I really do want to be with my family more. Maybe it\u2019s more a midlife crisis more than anything else.\u201d The announcement has prompted waves of speculation about Chaffetz\u2019 future. Some have said he may be eyeing a bid for governor in 2020 . Chaffetz told the Journal he was looking at the private sector. Utah election officials told Reuters they haven\u2019t been formally told about any plans for Chaffetz to resign. Mark Thomas, the state\u2019s director of elections, told Reuters officials have begun gathering information about when and how to hold a special election, but \u201cdon\u2019t know what he\u2019s planning.\u201d \u201cThis is more informal, just wanting to know ourselves and be prepared,\u201d Thomas said. Chaffetz has drawn fierce criticism from Democrats in recent months over claims he\u2019s been slow to investigate President Donald Trump\u2019s ongoing and unfounded claims of voter fraud and wiretapping by former President Barack Obama. He also drew sharp rebukes from Republicans and constituents after saying in February he wouldn\u2019t look into ties between former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn and the Russian ambassador \u2015 a relationship that led to the Flynn\u2019s firing. \u201cIt\u2019s taking care of itself,\u201d Chaffetz said at the time. Do you have information you want to share with the Huffington Post? Here\u2019s how. ALSO ON HUFFPOST Donald Trump Loves Signing Things Donald Trump Loves Signing Things 1 of 12 With few legislative accomplishments under his belt, President Donald Trump has repeatedly turned to executive orders \u2015 a tool once maligned by Republicans \u2015 to undo much of former President Barack Obama\u2019s regulatory legacy . While some have been consequential \u2015 like approving the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline \u2015 many of Trump\u2019s orders have been symbolic , like one minimizing the \u201cburden\u201d of Obamacare regulations. Trump appears to enjoy the act of signing executive orders and bills more than any of his recent predecessors.

(Photo: Ron Verhorst/Redferns) More When Michael Pagnotta launched his own PR firm, Reach Media, in early 1990s, Prince was his very first client. Now, more than a quarter-century later and one year after Prince\u2019s tragic death, Pagnotta remembers, in this exclusive personal essay for Yahoo Music, a fateful day in Australia when Prince confronted him and gave him some advice that changed his life and career.\n\u201cMichael, get your pen and paper and meet me in my dressing room.\u201d\nPrince was a man of famously few words, spending most his time \u2014 and mine, when I was representing him \u2014 refusing interviews rather than granting them. But as the first anniversary of his death arrives, I have had occasion to ponder a few words he did say to me. Words that changed my life.\nThe year was 1992. We were in Australia as part of the Diamonds and Pearls concert tour and things were going well, at least I thought so, until Prince came up behind me one night backstage and \u201csuggested\u201d a meeting. Before I could even turn around to respond, he was gone, vanishing as he often did \u2014 sometimes behind a wall of bodyguards, other times into thin air, like magic, leaving you wondering where the hell he\u2019d gone.\nI\u2019d figured out pretty quickly in my relationship with Paisley Park that the less actual personal contact you had with Prince, the better off you were. It meant he was cool with you and what you were doing. This meeting wasn\u2019t a good sign, and I started to think about what time the next plane home might be leaving and whether or not I\u2019d be on it.\nRelated: Prince Deliverance EP Blocked as Estate, Producers Spar in Court\nI did as he said, and got a pen and paper and headed to his dressing room, running obsessively through every \u201cI\u2019m sorry and I will do better!\u201d scenario I could imagine. Prince\u2019s half-brother and right-hand man Dwayne met me at the dressing room door and instructed me to enter and sit. Prince would be right with me.\nMichael Pagnotta\u2019s Prince mementos from over the years. (Photo courtesy of Michael Pagnotta) More Prince\u2019s dressing room was just as you\u2019d imagine it: a serene space decked out, if memory serves, in gold statuettes, scented candles, incense, caftans, throws, carpets. Splashes of yellow, purple, and gold everywhere. Part temple, part ancient desert caravan tent straight out of Ben Hur . In the center of the room was a couch, and I sat. The seat was broken and I sunk in, feeling like I might just fall through to the floor.\nAfter a few anxious minutes, Prince walked in, still dressed in his canary-yellow jumpsuit, do-rag, and boots from the show. The man had just performed a two-and-a-half-hour gig and he was perfectly coiffed and done up, looking like he\u2019d barely broken a sweat. If anything, I was the one who was sweating. Prince was a small guy, but with me sinking ever deeper into the broken seat cushions like a dying man in quicksand and having to look up at him, he looked like a giant. Intimidating.\nThere were no pleasantries. He got right down to business. He began to shift his weight from one leg to another, in a slow, metronomic dance as he interrogated me.\n\u201cHow many T-shirts we sell tonight?\u201d he asked, staring me right in the eye.\nThe question surprised me. I didn\u2019t sell T-shirts for the tour and had no access to the merch data, especially before the show had even settled. I didn\u2019t know, couldn\u2019t have known, but he made me feel like I should have. He was good at keeping people off balance.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d I said honestly and sheepishly.\nPrince let the uncertainty hang in the air for a second and started to speed up his dance, circling me as I sat, looking less like a canary in his yellow outfit than a bird of prey. He came around the front of me and stopped, looked me dead in the eye again.\nRead More \u201cHow many programs we sell?\u201d\nTo say I was freaking at this point would be an understatement. I didn\u2019t sell T-shirts or programs. Surely he knew that. The shows had sold out quickly and fans were stoked to see him and his new band, the New Power Generation. The singles were breaking strong at radio and the album was setting up to be Prince\u2019s best seller since Purple Rain \u2014 no small achievement, and one in which I took a lot of pride. Everything was going well, including the merch sales, as far as I knew. Where he was going, I still couldn\u2019t figure. Without meaning to be a wiseass, I answered with a clarification.\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if you know this, but I don\u2019t do merch for you. I do publicity.\u201d\nWrong answer. He stopped dancing in mid-twirl, turned his back toward me, then spun suddenly around, faced me and pointed his finger accusingly.\n\u201cYou trying to say that\u2019s not your job?\u201d\nI tried to respond with something positive about what my job actually was, as far as I was concerned.\n\u201cThe press has been\u2026\u201d\n\u201cYou gonna talk, or you wanna listen?\u201d\nHe slowed down his question, emphasizing each word.\n\u201cAre you trying to say \u2026 that\u2019s not \u2026 your job ?\u201d\nAnd then it hit me. I\u2019d watched him record through the night, jam for hours in tiny clubs after grueling arena gigs, rehearse the horn section for two hours over four bars of music, replace band members of opening act Carmen Electra (yes, that Carmen Electra) with members of the NPG one by one, adjust the soundboard, and leave explicit Do Not Touch orders for a professional soundman he was paying to do sound on tour. In the studio, and on stage, everything was his job. The band, the instruments, the sound, the lights, the costumes, the set, the visuals. Likewise, he was saying to me that everything was my job. Performance, publicity, and programs were all connected, all part of the same larger whole. It was a true light-bulb moment for me. In an age of specialization, of boundaries, of not wanting to step on anyone else\u2019s toes, Prince insisted on things getting done no matter who had to do it. Or how. Your job description was: everything .\n\u201cIt\u2019s all my job,\u201d I replied simply, finally getting it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all your job,\u201d he repeated, flashing a sly half-smile and pointing to the door. \u201cBye.\u201d\nEven the conversation had been a performance for him. But a learning experience for me.\nI walked out of the dressing room with my head spinning. I was a young publicist whose first client in his own business was one of the biggest pop stars in the world. I\u2019d been feeling pretty good about myself and the way I did my job. But that conversation changed everything about the way I looked at myself and my business. There have been countless recollections from fans and critics and colleagues of Prince\u2019s, all citing how inspirational he and his music were to them and to the world. Thankfully, the reunited Revolution and New Power Generation will keep his greatest legacy, his music, alive in the coming months and years. But when I think of Prince, it\u2019s not only the inspiration but the perspiration I think about. For me, you can sum up his legacy in one word: Work.\nI\u2019d come into Prince\u2019s orbit after he\u2019d already achieved his greatest commercial and critical successes \u2014 1999 , Purple Rain , Sign O\u2019 the Times \u2014 and just following the relative disappointment of the Graffiti Bridge album and film. It was the very early \u201990s. Music was changing. Prince\u2019s brand of funky eclecticism was on the verge of falling out of fashion. Hip-hop and grunge were taking over. A lesser artist, or less competitive one, might have thrown up his hands, given up, or given in, content to rest on a well-earned reputation. But instead, Prince changed everything.\nHe formed a new band, the New Power Generation, and forged a new sound \u2014 adding Tony Mosley, a rapper, to the mix, finding a place for hip-hop in his new music. He changed his image, complete with new updo hairstyle and dandified outfits designed specifically for him in his own wardrobe department at Paisley Park. Flannel shirts and baggy jeans, trends at that time, simply would not do. He brought dancers Diamond and Pearl on board to up the eye candy quotient in the \u201cGett Off\u201d and \u201cCream\u201d videos and in live performances. Finally he added a belly dancer, Mayte, his muse and future wife, to the NPG mix, instructing me to tell press at various tour stops that he\u2019d kidnapped her from a foreign land.\nRelated: Mayte Garcia Opens Up About Child She Lost With Prince: \u2018I Don\u2019t Think He Ever Got Over It\u2019\nEach of these changes were tools he gave me. Tools I used to help Diamonds and Pearls become the second-biggest album of Prince\u2019s career. The Prince from the Dirty Mind and Purple Rain and Batman days was gone, replaced by a butt-baring ringmaster of the funkiest circus in the universe. Yes, he\u2019d changed everything. Eventually, he would even change his name. But that\u2019s another story.\nIn the end, work was the key to Prince\u2019s success, perhaps as much as his raw talent. You don\u2019t leave an immense recorded catalog or a vault with hundreds, maybe thousands, of unreleased songs unless you work . You don\u2019t earn a reputation as one of the greatest musicians, stage performers, and songwriters ever unless you work.\nAnother client of mine, George Michael, once complained to me that Prince didn\u2019t \u201cedit\u201d himself well enough , releasing too much, too fast. I think George missed the point. Sometimes, it is about output \u2014 asking your fans to drink not from a fountain, but from a fire hose. Do it, label and critics be damned, and move on to the next thing. Prince did that, whether the chart-keepers were paying attention or not, in a decades-long burst of Warholian productivity. Is there any one of us, now that he is gone, who wishes Prince had taken it all easier, had worked less?\nIt\u2019s all your job . Teamwork is fine, but every team needs a leader. If you want to be successful, you have to be aware of it all, stay on top of it all, be responsible for it all, willing to do it all. That was his daunting message, and over the years it has served me well. So the words that I\u2019d once feared might be a dire warning turned out instead to be life-changing wisdom that I have carried with me ever since. Much has been made of Prince\u2019s media silence in those years, but that simple lesson is more memorable to me than anything he ever said to Rolling Stone , Spin , Vibe , or any other interview. In fact, it\u2019s what I remember most.\nWhen it came to business, I\u2019m proud and humbled to say everything I needed to know about the music business, and maybe even life, I learned from working with Prince.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ujGAbxl3BFHzjz1az_hTbg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9ODAw/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/4854e498c4734563c4f525a496b56e03"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "prince", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ron verhorst/redferns", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ben hur", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dwayne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "batman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carmen electra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mayte garcia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george michael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chael pagnotta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pagnotta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mayte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tony mosley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "new power generation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "npg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rolling stone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "producers spar in court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reach media", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yahoo music", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "pearl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paisley park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-20T21:28:17.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "75b968645756de499f2041ea3f6293536a07ca79", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxTqL_zg0lpoS81jynL6xz66bHkAGFKPSIj5_XswJU5v95rDNd9Dtk1NO2.JqMd1b1Urz6F5VqFJaIdvieEwJx.g--", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "site": "nytimes.com", "site_section": "http://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/GlobalSports.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "NYT > Sports", "title": "Arnold Palmer\u2019s Hometown Golf Course Adjusts to Life Without Him", "title_full": "Arnold Palmer\u2019s Hometown Golf Course Adjusts to Life Without Him", "published": "2017-04-22T07:36:37.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/22/sports/22latrobe1/22latrobe1-facebookJumbo.jpg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 98, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 971, "comments": 0, "shares": 971}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 6}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "75b968645756de499f2041ea3f6293536a07ca79", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxTqL_zg0lpoS81jynL6xz66bHkAGFKPSIj5_XswJU5v95rDNd9Dtk1NO2.JqMd1b1Urz6F5VqFJaIdvieEwJx.g--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "GARY SANTANIELLO", "published": "2017-04-22T07:36:37.000+03:00", "title": "Arnold Palmer\u2019s Hometown Golf Course Adjusts to Life Without Him", "text": "Arnold Palmer\u2019s Hometown Golf Course Adjusts to Life Without Him By GARY SANTANIELLO Photo Arnold Palmer at Latrobe Country Club in 1969. Credit Associated Press LATROBE, Pa. \u2014 It was a mild winter here, about 40 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, so the golf season started early at Latrobe Country Club, well in advance of Saturday\u2019s annual Kickoff Classic. There has already been a much different feel to the season, though, as it is the first in more than 80 years that Arnold Palmer is not part of. His absence is felt most deeply at the course his father helped build as a 17-year-old in the early 1920s, where Palmer learned the game and where he returned as an adult every summer to his home, office and workshop on the hill overlooking the club entrance. He was a constant presence at the club during the golf season until his death last September at 87 . Though Palmer stopped playing two years ago, he tooled around the course in his golf cart, the customary two bags brimming with clubs strapped in back. He hung out at the driving range or chatted with members. Continue reading the main story He had lunch most days at his regular table in the Palmer Grille, which was known simply as the men\u2019s grille until a few years ago. His chair was the closest to the door of the men\u2019s locker room and to the bar, so he could survey the room and easily greet and banter with members. At night, he often ate upstairs with Kit, his wife of 11 years, in the relaxed but comfortable dining room, which, like the rest of the club, featured artwork, photographs and memorabilia from his storied life and golf career. Photo Artwork of Arnold Palmer by the artist LeRoy Neiman is inside the Palmer Grille at Latrobe Country Club. Credit Matt Pellis Brian Miller, the vice president of an engineering company in Latrobe, was part of Palmer\u2019s regular golf group for more than 30 years. Miller; Jim Bryan, a local dentist; and Marty Newington played almost every day when Palmer was in town, from early May through October, and then had lunch together. Referring to Palmer\u2019s absence, Miller said, \u201cIt\u2019s difficult, no doubt about it.\u201d Palmer purchased the club in 1971, and as club president, he had a parking spot next to the clubhouse entrance. When members saw his golf cart, they knew he was somewhere on the property. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Now, said Dr. Barbara Wang, a member for five years, \u201cYou go around the corner, and he\u2019s not going to be there.\u201d Wang got to know Palmer when they served on the board of the Latrobe Area Hospital Charitable Foundation. Though they never played golf together, she said he had always asked about her golf game. \u201cHe always made you feel like you were the most special person in the world,\u201d she said. \u201cHe had a warmth that was hard to describe. There was something pretty magical about him.\u201d Photo Arnold Palmer\u2019s locker at Latrobe Country Club, which, upon his death, was locked with the contents still inside. Credit Matt Pellis Palmer lived in Orlando, Fla., in the winter, but he was ingrained in Latrobe, a former industrial hub of 8,300, like no one else. At the time of his death, he was chairman of the Westmoreland County Airport Authority, which operates the regional airport that is five minutes up the road from his house and was named for him in 1999. The airport\u2019s executive director, Gabe Monzo, who first met Palmer while busing tables at the country club as a teenager, said he had relished the enthusiasm Palmer brought to meetings. \u201cHe was a great motivator,\u201d Monzo said. \u201cHe\u2019d get you fired up about an idea.\u201d Two miles from the club at Arnold Palmer Motors, Palmer memorabilia fills the waiting area and adorns the showroom. The dealership\u2019s general manager, Ron Paluzzi, Palmer\u2019s friend for 26 years, said he had sent Palmer sales reports every day. A life member of the volunteer fire department in Youngstown, a small borough that abuts the country club, Palmer would occasionally visit the department\u2019s cozy social hall down the street from his house. \u201cWe never thought of him as famous,\u201d said Rand Hauser, a member of the social hall. \u201cWe knew him as a neighbor.\u201d Photo A display case inside the clubhouse featuring trophies and awards won by Arnold Palmer during his career. Credit Matt Pellis Palmer was responsible for incalculable acts of charity, large and small. He provided cash for a new fire truck and donated land for a nature preserve named after his first wife, Winnie. He was often seen in town, dining at Tin Lizzie or Touchdown Club II, grocery shopping at Giant Eagle or participating in the annual Fourth of July parade, driving his father\u2019s orange 1947 Toro tractor, which Palmer made famous in his Pennzoil commercials of the 1980s. \nAdvertisement His contributions to Latrobe will continue. In March, Amy Saunders, the younger of Palmer\u2019s two daughters, announced annual scholarships in her parents\u2019 names for five graduating seniors at Greater Latrobe Senior High School. Without Palmer himself, though, Wang said, \u201cA little bit of specialness is gone from the town.\u201d The sense of loss is particularly acute at the country club. Palmer never lived anywhere in town but in homes either on club property or adjacent to it. The house he was born in was 50 yards from the current fifth tee. He grew up helping his father, known as Deke, maintain the course, driving a 1922 Fordson tractor well before he got his driver\u2019s license. And when Palmer became the club\u2019s owner, when his father was still its golf professional, he cared for it as if it had been his third child. Stan Caraher has been a member for almost 30 years, and five years ago, he moved to a home on Palmer Place that he said is 776 yards to the club\u2019s 15th green. Photo Arnold Palmer was a life member of the volunteer fire department in Youngstown, Pa. Credit Gene J. Puskar/Associated Press The club\u2019s membership was an extension of Palmer\u2019s family, Caraher said. \u201cHe took great pride in the clubhouse, making sure it was very comfortable for all the members,\u201d he added. The head professional, Matt Pellis, who has worked at the club since 2002, said that until Palmer\u2019s health had begun slipping, he was often seen jogging or riding a bike on the course\u2019s cart paths. On Mondays, when the clubhouse is closed, Pellis said, Palmer would occasionally drive his Cadillac Escalade along the cart path to the halfway house for lunchtime hot dogs with his office staff.

It was direct sunlight.\u201d\nWhat Wangchuck saw reflected in the ice that day was realised four years ago, when he unveiled his first \u201cice stupa\u201d, an artificial glacier that towered surreally over the otherwise arid landscape, and for which in December he received a prestigious \u00a380,000 innovation prize.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Wangchuck Sonam won the 2016 Rolex Award for Enterprise. Photograph: Stefan Walter/Rolex Awards \nIt is the latest solution to an old problem in the Himalayan foothills. Despite its breathtaking scenery, life in Ladakh has always been hard. It is a desert at 10,000 feet, receiving on average just 50mm of rainfall each year. \u201cThe only reason people can live there is the glaciers,\u201d Wangchuk says. \nEach winter, titanic shelves of ice form at high altitudes and melt throughout the spring, flowing downwards into the streams that are the veins of civilisation on the mountain. Lately, that cycle has faltered.\nUnnaturally high global temperatures threaten ice shelves everywhere \u2013 but researchers believe Himalayan glaciers are shrinking more quickly than any on earth. Less water is reaching Ladakh\u2019s farms and villages, and when it does, the volume of water from the faster-melting glaciers can break the banks of streams, causing floods.\nWangchuk is not the first to try to wring a more sustainable water supply from the mountains. For centuries, inhabitants of the Hindu Kush and Karakoram ranges have practiced \u201cglacier grafting\u201d , chipping away at existing ice and pooling the pieces at higher altitudes, hoping to create new glaciers that can supply streams throughout the growing season. Apocryphally, villagers in the 13 th century \u201cgrew\u201d such glaciers across mountain passes to stop the advance of Genghis Khan.\nMore than a decade ago, another Indian engineer devised an update. Chewang Norphel earned the nickname the \u201ciceman of Ladakh\u201d by using a network of pipes to divert meltwater into artificial lakes on shaded sides of the mountain. The water would freeze at night, creating glaciers that grew each day as new water flowed into the basin. Norphel created 11 reservoirs that supplied water to 10,000 people.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A view of the Phyang monastery in Ladakh. Photograph: Stefan Walter/Rolex Awards \n\u201cThe problem was that it couldn\u2019t be done in lower altitudes, where people actually live,\u201d says Wangchuk. The lakes were also restricted to heavily shaded areas, and simply melted too quickly to make up for the shortfall in water wrought by increasing temperatures. Adapting the concept became Wangchuck\u2019s obsession. The auspicious chunk of ice on the bridge showed him how that could be done.\n\u201cThe ice needed to be shaded \u2013 but how?\u201d he says. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t have it under a bridge, or use reflectors, which aren\u2019t practical at scale. So we thought of this conical shape: making ice shade itself.\u201d\nIt was a kind of biomimicry: artificial innovation based on natural phenomena, such as velcro \u2013 modelled on the way plant burrs attach to dogs, or new skin grafts that stick to bodies by piercing the tissue and expanding, the same way parasitic worms fix to the intestines of their hosts.\nThe conical shape hit a sweet spot, maximising the volume of ice that can be \u201cgrown\u201d, while minimising the surface area exposed to direct sunlight. That means it keeps melting well into the spring, releasing up to 5,000 litres of water each day by \u201cstoring it in the sky\u201d, Wangchuk says.\nIt also has the benefit of resembling the Buddhist stupas \u2013 religious sites used for meditation and worship \u2013 that dot the landscape, a crucial point for 50-year-old. \u201cBecause it resembles something we have in our tradition, it is made more close to the population, to their hearts,\u201d he says.\nSynchronising his work with nature and tradition are key to the inventor\u2019s practice. \u201cGenerally I like things to be simple and self-acting,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, simplicity is beauty, simplicity is the ultimate satisfaction.\u201d\nAnd the stupas are simple. They are formed by running pipes below the frost line, at which temperature the water hovers between a liquid and solid state. Then the pipes turn skywards, spraying the water into -20C air, using the bitter cold to freeze it as it falls to earth.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest How the ice pyramids or artificial glaciers work: gravity pressure forces water up through a pipe to form ice stupas that store water for the crop growing season. Photograph: Sonam Wangchuk/Rolex Awards \nThe first prototype, stretching 20 feet high, was built in October 2013, and expected to melt by the beginning of May. It lasted eighteen days longer. A second much larger stupa was grown near a forest of 5,000 trees, and kept them watered throughout the driest months until 6 July.\nThose two stupas were funded by crowdsourcing donations. Last year, Wangchuk was awarded a Rolex innovation grant , money he will use to create the next generation of ice towers. 20 more, each 100 feet high, are in the works.\nHe will also use the money to fund an \u201calternative university\u201d in Ladakh to train young people to see in their surroundings answers to the region\u2019s problems. \u201cSolutions for the mountains, by the mountain people,\u201d he says.\nTopics Glaciers Half full: solutions, innovations, answers Mountains Water Climate change India Sustainable development features  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-22T11:32:42.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7fcfe393c79c73af7ab6028875a706a336352182", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_n1LN1JBVHSygtc3iUVjo_0KHGgM.4ZTW4B4790wRHnaOcLfaCGYtgTR_uEFPnyCz5yd1m5JbcNCWUCKiSOlLUAF5KFOrHCsAcNh5xhd9MX1g-", "site_full": "www.theguardian.com", "site": "theguardian.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Adam Johnson secretly filmed saying he wished he had raped 15-year-old victim | UK news | The Guardian", "title_full": "Adam Johnson secretly filmed saying he wished he had raped 15-year-old victim | UK news | The Guardian", "published": "2017-04-21T13:18:16.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.009, "main_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71b8394042cd545509ac80ac15d48fc5c7ce4d11/0_4_1213_727/master/1213.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft&amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&amp;s=95b4644aa9e8110a26ef605a39a76fbe", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 170, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 971, "comments": 0, "shares": 971}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 33}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7fcfe393c79c73af7ab6028875a706a336352182", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_n1LN1JBVHSygtc3iUVjo_0KHGgM.4ZTW4B4790wRHnaOcLfaCGYtgTR_uEFPnyCz5yd1m5JbcNCWUCKiSOlLUAF5KFOrHCsAcNh5xhd9MX1g-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Josh Halliday", "published": "2017-04-21T13:18:16.000+03:00", "title": "Adam Johnson secretly filmed saying he wished he had raped 15-year-old victim | UK news | The Guardian", "text": "Prisons and probation Adam Johnson video prompts Prison Service investigation \nFormer England footballer, who was jailed for six years in March, caught on camera in jail laughing about sexually assaulting fan Adam Johnson, who last month lost a second attempt to overturn his conviction.

Sloan, the chief executive of Wells Fargo, last month. After a sham accounts scandal, he said, \u201cwe had to fundamentally change how we are organized.\u201d Credit Richard Drew/Associated Press For years, as Wells Fargo secretly set up millions of fake bank and credit card accounts without customers\u2019 consent, the bank\u2019s federal regulator was learning of hundreds of whistle-blower complaints against the company for its sales tactics. But that regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency , did not act. In a damning, 15-page report published on Wednesday, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency admitted that its oversight of Wells Fargo was \u201cuntimely and ineffective.\u201d The report said the agency failed to spot clues that would have allowed it to connect the dots in one of the most brazen banking scandals of the recent past. Since 2005, Wells Fargo\u2019s board had received regular notifications indicating that \u201cthe highest level\u201d of ethics line complaints and employee firings were related to sales integrity violations, according to the report. It also said that even though the regulating agency started receiving those reports around early 2010, there was no evidence that it adequately followed up on those concerns. And even after the regulator confronted a Wells Fargo executive in 2010 about 700 cases of whistle-blower complaints, the regulator did not require the bank to provide adequate analysis, according to the report, which was issued by the comptroller\u2019s office of enterprise governance and its ombudsman. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency recently removed its top Wells Fargo examiner, Bradley Linskens, from a position in which he led 60 regulatory supervisors. The regulating agency\u2019s review follows a similarly harsh report from a panel of Wells Fargo\u2019s board members, published last week, that identified red flags that should have indicated that something was awry years ago. An increasing number of customers seemed to be opening accounts without ever making a deposit, for instance. And as early as 2004, a manager with Wells Fargo\u2019s internal investigations group noticed the so-called sales gaming cases, in which bankers tinkered inappropriately with customer accounts, had risen to about 680 in 2004, from 63 in 2000.

And yet this Friday\u2019s debut of The Promise is shaping up to be a big loser on the balance sheet, at least according to this weekend\u2019s  box office preview at The Hollywood Reporter . In her forecast, THR \u2019s Pamela McClintock  writes that things are looking exceedingly bleak for the Bale-Isaac romantic drama, which is set against the backdrop of Armenian genocide. Produced for $100 million by the late Kirk Kerkorian via his Survival Pictures, The Promise is predicted to net only about $4 million domestically, which \u2014 considering what that means for its prospects in subsequent weeks \u2014 is a doomsday scenario. While producers are downplaying such a situation, claiming that what\u2019s really important is that all theatrical receipts go toward funding nonprofits (including Elton John\u2019s AIDS foundation ), there\u2019s no way to truly sugarcoat its expected box-office crash and burn.\nEric Esrailian, now in charge at Survival, told THR  where he places the blame: \u201cIt became clear that the government of Turkey was going to have an influence on this movie. One of the most insidious realities of our existence in the United States is that foreign governments can control art. I would say at the highest levels from different studios, we were just basically told that no matter how good the film would be, it was never going be released by certain companies. I think that that\u2019s truly shameful, but it\u2019s just a reality that we had to deal with.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s left unsaid by Esrailian, however, is the more basic reality that, as large-scale film budgets soar, so too do the financial risks. Deadline recently reported that the Scarlett Johansson -led Ghost in the Shell remake stands to lose around $60 million (after costing close to $250 million to make/promote). And both Ghost in the Shell and The Promise come on the heels of a 2016 in which numerous tentpole spectaculars took a huge financial bath , including Alice Through the Looking Glass (estimated $70 million loss), Allied (somewhere in the $75M-$90M range), The BFG (close to $100 million), and Ben-Hur (as much as $120 million).\nThat studio filmmaking is a dicey financial proposition is nothing new; movie moguls have been producing epic flops for decades. But with costs only on the rise, films like The Promise may soon become gambles that make even the most spendthrift of financiers think twice.\n\u2018The Promise\u2019: Watch a trailer: \nWatch trailers , movies and more on Yahoo View , available now on iOS and Android . \nRead More from THR : \n\u2018Ben-Hur\u2019 to \u2018BFG\u2019: Hollywood\u2019s Biggest Box Office Bombs of 2016 2016 Box Office Revenue Hits $11.7B for Another Record Year \u2018Fate of the Furious\u2019 Box Office: Who Showed Up and Who Didn\u2019t", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-preview-promise-unforgettable-no-match-furious-8-995693", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fate-furious-box-office-who-showed-up-who-didnt-994483", "http://ejaf.org/&quot;", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/2016-box-office-record-year-crosses-11-billion-959300", "http://deadline.com/2017/04/ghost-in-the-shell-scarlett-johansson-box-office-flop-whitewash-1202061479/", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/2016s-biggest-box-office-bombs-958780/item/box-office-bombs-ben-hur-958753", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-preview-promise-unforgettable-no-match-furious-8-995693&quot;", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/2016s-biggest-box-office-bombs-958780/item/box-office-bombs-assassins-creed-958770&quot;", "http://ejaf.org/", "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/2016s-biggest-box-office-bombs-958780/item/box-office-bombs-assassins-creed-958770", "http://deadline.com/2017/04/ghost-in-the-shell-scarlett-johansson-box-office-flop-whitewash-1202061479/&quot;", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sGyBMQfWsrNFN7mk5naSrQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjtzbT0xO3c9NjYxO2g9MzQ2/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/f34448631cc4751b357006856b784873"], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "oscar isaac", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "christian bale", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "eric esrailian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "terry george", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "esrailian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pamela mcclintock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scarlett johansson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirk kerkorian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "elton john", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "epic box-office meltdown", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shell", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "survival pictures", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "biggest box office bombs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thr", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollywood reporter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hotel rwanda", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-20T20:18:03.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "4f5230cfaa3a7c21c18df0e4541f5b47fadc1112", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zC1.YsIxbbrrD8asMjT_VmoPl_mRh.Co.hkOM_8a49kap92u7.4Ijl8zH8mYBgyYTju2ElujEZom2.0UpHIzkw4VyFnEXYrho1B6_kBibF0N4MEPjQ8sQscDS.327_eWx_HOTVVFQHoA4RN_lq11DlE", "site_full": "timesofindia.indiatimes.com", "site": "indiatimes.com", "site_section": "http://m.timesofindia.com/rssfeedsdefault.cms", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The Times of India", "title": "Cow vigilantism in J&K: Four accused arrested", "title_full": "Cow vigilantism in J&K: Four accused arrested", "published": "2017-04-22T15:51:48.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/photo/58315661.cms", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 116, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 969, "comments": 0, "shares": 969}, "gplus": {"shares": 4}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "4f5230cfaa3a7c21c18df0e4541f5b47fadc1112", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMpq8HEnNTp9633LOQohzWJQbtEF77zD0zC1.YsIxbbrrD8asMjT_VmoPl_mRh.Co.hkOM_8a49kap92u7.4Ijl8zH8mYBgyYTju2ElujEZom2.0UpHIzkw4VyFnEXYrho1B6_kBibF0N4MEPjQ8sQscDS.327_eWx_HOTVVFQHoA4RN_lq11DlE", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-04-22T15:51:48.000+03:00", "title": "Cow vigilantism in J&K: Four accused arrested", "text": "Cow vigilantism in J$K: 9-year-old girl attacked; four accused arrested Cow vigilantism in J&K: 9-year-old girl attacked; four accused arrested All four persons involved in the attack on the family have been arrested, police said.

Security Council sanctions. \nThe Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the North\u2019s ruling Workers\u2019 Party, did not mince its words. \n\u201cIn the case of our super-mighty preemptive strike being launched, it will completely and immediately wipe out not only U.S. imperialists\u2019 invasion forces in South Korea and its surrounding areas but the U.S. mainland and reduce them to ashes,\u201d it said. KCNA KCNA / Reuters Military vehicles carry missiles during a military parade marking the 105th birth anniversary of country's founding father Kim Il Sung, \nReclusive North Korea regularly threatens to destroy Japan, South Korea and the United States and has shown no let-up in its belligerence after a failed missile test on Sunday, a day after putting on a huge display of missiles at a parade in Pyongyang. \n\u201cWe\u2019re reviewing all the status of North Korea, both in terms of state sponsorship of terrorism as well as the other ways in which we can bring pressure on the regime in Pyongyang to re-engage with us, but re-engage with us on a different footing than past talks have been held,\u201d Tillerson told reporters in Washington on Wednesday. \nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence, on a tour of Asian allies, has said repeatedly an \u201cera of strategic patience\u201d with North Korea is over. \nU.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said during a visit to London the military option must be part of the pressure brought to bear. \n\u201cAllowing this dictator to have that kind of power is not something that civilized nations can allow to happen,\u201d he said in reference to Kim. \nRyan said he was encouraged by the results of efforts to work with China to reduce tension, but that it was unacceptable North Korea might be able to strike allies with nuclear weapons. \nNorth and South Korea are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. \n\u2018MAX THUNDER\u2019 \nSouth Korea\u2019s acting president, Hwang Kyo-ahn, at a meeting with top officials on Thursday, repeatedly called for the military and security ministries to maintain vigilance. \nThe defense ministry said U.S. and South Korean air forces were conducting an annual training exercise, codenamed Max Thunder, until April 28. North Korea routinely labels such exercises preparations for invasion. \n\u201cWe are conducting a practical and more intensive exercise than ever,\u201d South Korean pilot Lieutenant Colonel Lee Bum-chul told reporters. \u201cThrough this exercise, I am sure we can deter war and remove our enemy\u2019s intention to provoke us.\u201d \nSouth Korean presidential candidates clashed on Wednesday night in a debate over the planned deployment in South Korea of a U.S.-supplied Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system, which has angered China. \nFrontrunner Moon Jae-in was criticized for leaving his options open before the May 9 election. \nOn Monday, Hwang and Pence reaffirmed their plans to go ahead with the THAAD, but the decision will be up to the next South Korean president. For its part, China says the system\u2019s powerful radar is a threat to its security. \nThe North has said it has developed a missile that can strike the mainland United States, but officials and experts believe it is some time away from mastering the necessary technology, including miniaturizing a nuclear warhead. RUSSIA, U.S. AT ODDS \nThe United States and Russia clashed at the United Nations on Wednesday over a U.S.-drafted Security Council statement to condemn North Korea\u2019s latest failed ballistic missile test. \nDiplomats said China had agreed to the statement. \nSuch statements by the 15-member council have to be agreed by consensus. \nPrevious statements denouncing missile launches \u201cwelcomed efforts by council members, as well as other states, to facilitate a peaceful and comprehensive solution through dialog.\u201d The latest draft statement dropped \u201cthrough dialog\u201d and Russia requested it be included again. \n\u201cWhen we requested to restore the agreed language that was of political importance and expressed commitment to continue to work on the draft ... the U.S. delegation without providing any explanations canceled the work on the draft,\u201d the Russian U.N. mission said in a statement. \nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China believed in the Security Council maintaining unity. \n\u201cSpeaking with one voice is extremely important to the Security Council appropriately responding to the relevant issue on the peninsula,\u201d he told reporters. \nThere has been some confusion over the whereabouts of a U.S. aircraft carrier group after Trump said last week he had sent an \u201carmada\u201d as a warning to North Korea, even as the ships were still far from Korean waters. \nThe U.S. military\u2019s Pacific Command explained that the USS Carl Vinson strike group first had to complete a shorter-than-planned period of training with Australia. It was now heading for the Western Pacific as ordered, it said. \nChina\u2019s influential Global Times newspaper, which is published by the People\u2019s Daily, the Communist Party\u2019s official paper, wondered whether the misdirection was deliberate. \n\u201cThe truth seems to be that the U.S. military and president jointly created fake news and it is without doubt a rare scandal in U.S. history, which will be bound to cripple Trump\u2019s and U.S. dignity,\u201d it said.

I feel lucky to have encountered scientific research as well as advice from seasoned trippers. Both are invaluable: I co-run a safety website called drugsand.me which combines old-school truisms with new findings. Everyone should know the fundamentals before a blotter touches their tongue.\nBut tripping isn\u2019t just about the drugs. As the shaman Julian Vayne explains in his manual for getting the best out of psychedelics, Getting Higher , all highs are products of their context.

In an interview with Yahoo News anchor Bianna Golodryga Friday afternoon, Nye encouraged Trump to think for himself because the people influencing his decision making are \u201cfrom the old days.\u201d \u201cIf you want to be reelected and if you want to have an eight-year legacy instead of a less than four-year legacy, embrace the future. Consider the electoral map as presented if only millennials voted, and take climate change into account,\u201d said Nye, who is popular among young Americans thanks to his \u201890s TV show \u201cBill Nye the Science Guy.\u201d \u201cEmbrace the discoveries made by science. Continue to invest in science, if for no other reason than for the sake of the economy.\u201d A poll from the University of Texas at Austin found that 91 percent of Americans under the age of 35 say climate change is happening. For comparison, only 74 percent of survey respondents 65 or older thought so. Exit polls indicate that if only millennials had voted in bigger numbers in last year\u2019s presidential election, then Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton would have won in a landslide. Golodryga suggested that winning might be the only factor motivating Trump\u2019s actions. She asked Nye whether he thinks embracing the battle against climate change would, in fact, get him another term in the Oval Office. \u201cYeah, actually yes. No one\u2019s ever asked the question quite so succinctly, thank you,\u201d Nye said. \u201cThe people who deny climate change are almost exclusively old, like me. \u2026 And they will age out of the electorate. So if you want to be elected by future voters \u2014 people coming of age right now \u2014 you\u2019re going to have to embrace climate change and especially you\u2019re going to have to embrace science.\u201d Nye pointed out that Trump has changed his mind on a variety of issues in the past few years and even months. He said Trump would benefit from dismissing what some of his current advisers are telling him and listening to forward-thinking, younger people who are concerned about the environment and the world that their children and grandchildren will inherit. Trump has variously said that climate change was a hoax concocted by the Chinese to make the United States uncompetitive in manufacturing and that \u201cnobody really knows\u201d whether it\u2019s real. Neither is true. Many worldwide scientific organizations and U.S. agencies have released definitive statements affirming that climate change is happening, that it\u2019s primarily the result of human activity releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, and that steps should be taken to mitigate the worst consequences. For instance, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said that the evidence of the climate system\u2019s warming is unequivocal. \u201cHuman influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are the highest in history. Recent climate changes have had widespread impacts on human and natural systems,\u201d the panel said in a report. So far, however, Trump has spurned scientists and environmentalists and embraced the coal , oil and natural-gas industries. During his first few months in office, he acted to relax regulations on energy companies and proposed budget cuts for federal agencies that protect the environment and natural resources. He also signed an executive order (Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth) that essentially starts the process of dismantling former President Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan , which limited greenhouse-gas emissions from coal-burning power plants. A recent Gallup poll found that 59 percent of Americans think that protecting the environment should be prioritized over energy production; 56 percent said that environmental protection should be prioritized over economic growth. Although the Trump administration often presents environmental regulations as \u201cjob killers,\u201d there are studies to show that moving from fossil fuels to clean renewable energy could create millions of jobs. The American Wind Energy Association, a national trade group for the wind sector, announced earlier this week that jobs in wind power grew nine times faster than the overall economy last year. \nRead More For Nye, acknowledging the reality of climate change and the legitimacy of scientific evidence would put Trump on track for a positive presidential legacy. \u201cClimate change is the most serious issue facing humankind, for sure,\u201d Nye said. \u201cI strongly encourage the president to consider that science is universal. It\u2019s for everybody on earth. The climate is for everybody on earth. Space exploration is for everybody on earth. Clean water, renewably produced reliable electricity and access to electronic information [is] for everyone on earth.

Hawaii is a chain of dozens of islands, in the Pacific Ocean. Many of them small and uninhabited, but there are eight main islands. They are Hawaii, Maui, Oahu, Kauai, Molokai, Lanai, Niihau and Kahoolawe.\nHawaii is famous for warm sunshine, beautiful mountains and beaches, and friendly people. Hawaii\u2019s largest city is its capital, Honolulu , which has a population of about 350,000, within a county of about 993,000. By comparison, Birmingham, the largest city in Alabama, has 212,000 people. If you ask, \u201cWhere would you like to go on your honeymoon, Honolulu or Birmingham?\u201d many people will not understand why that is a question.\nHawaii has many military bases that keep the United States safe and strong in the world. One base, Pearl Harbor, was bombed by Japan in 1941. Hawaii was not a state then, but the United States fought to defend Hawaii anyway, because it was part of America. Many people from Hawaii served bravely in World War II , and many died. One of Hawaii\u2019s best-known war heroes, Daniel Inouye, lost his arm in combat in Italy. He served many years in the United States Senate.\nHawaii is well-known for its long tradition of welcoming and love, called the \u201cAloha spirit.\u201d Alabama used to be famous for a spirit called \u201cJim Crow,\u201d a system of laws to keep people with darker skin separate from white people.\nWhat does \u201cJim Crow\u201d have to do with Hawaii? A lot!\nHawaii became the 50th state in 1959, after a long struggle. Many people in Hawaii wanted to join the union, and many people in the mainland United States supported them. But statehood failed for many years in Congress because lawmakers from the South bitterly opposed it.\n They thought that Hawaii was too far away, and that it had too many people of Asian and Polynesian descent and not enough Caucasians . Mostly they thought that Hawaii\u2019s new representatives in Congress would support civil rights and vote to end \u201cJim Crow.\u201d\nCivil rights include the right to vote, to go to decent schools, and not be hanged by mobs. The Southern lawmakers who opposed civil rights were Democrats then, though they later changed parties to become Republicans. They were also known as Dixiecrats . Today we call them racists .\n Congress, the president and the courts eventually all agreed that \u201cJim Crow\u201d violated the Constitution , the basic rules of our government, including the one that all people are equal and must be treated that way.\nBut even though \u201cJim Crow\u201d was defeated, the battle for civil rights continues, because not everybody in America understands or fully accepts the Constitution. People are still struggling to be able to vote, and to go to decent schools, but also to have clean water to drink and not to be killed by police officers.\nAnother of the Constitution\u2019s most basic rules is that the government consists of equal parts \u2014 the executive, legislative and judicial branches. None is supposed to have power over the other, so that a tyrant cannot take control, and make the laws himself. The Constitution applies in every state, even Hawaii, and if there is disagreement over what the Constitution says, judges get to decide.\nThis is a very simple idea. But one famous Republican, Jeff Sessions of Alabama, said recently that he was \u201camazed\u201d that a judge in Hawaii, which he called \u201can island in the Pacific,\u201d could issue a decision that stopped President Trump from doing what he wanted.

Plus, citing ethical concerns, she\u2019ll be donating the proceeds from the book to the National Urban League and the Boys & Girls Clubs of America. Due to her role as an unpaid advisor to her father, the president of the United States, financial gain from her personal business would conflict with her governmental duties. President Obama, for example, only collected royalties from his first two books while in office; the third book, Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters , was written during his time in the White House, so the proceeds were donated to charity . There\u2019s further precedent for president-adjacent authors forgoing profit from their books; both Barbara Bush and Hillary Clinton did just that . If anything, Ivanka Trump\u2019s choice to donate these earnings solidifies the official professional relationship between her and her father, Bloomberg reports . While she\u2019s skipping out on an official promotional book tour, Trump will, however, visit Berlin on her first official international trip , where she\u2019ll be on a panel closely related to the topic of her forthcoming title: women and empowerment in the workplace. Still, the move to donate rather than directly profit from the platform afforded by governmental appointment is more ethically sound than previous decisions made by the Trump administration . Last summer, HuffPost\u2019s Christina Wilkie reported that President Donald Trump said the proceeds of his book, Crippled America , would go to charity, but the then-candidate later disclosed that he earned between $1 and $5 million from the project. And, last October, HuffPost reported that Trump was using small donors\u2019 money to purchase copies of his own book The Art of the Deal , resulting in personal royalties from the sales. Ultimately, if Ivanka Trump\u2019s donations do make it to the charities she\u2019s named, the move is in keeping with the established principles for books published by first family members.

Hernandez did not leave behind any suicide note, but he did reportedly write the words \"John 3:16\" on his forehead before his death. The widely known Bible verse says, \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.\" The Washington Post reported that a Bible found in his cell was reportedly opened to that page.\nTrending: Mother-of-four forced to leave her children after deportation to Mexico\nWBZ-TV, the CBS affiliate in Boston, reported Hernandez was also found with markings on both his hands and feet. The markings drawn on his body were done with a \"blood red\" marker, Boston's Fox25 reported. Some are speculating that the former New England Patriots player was attempting to draw stigmata markings on his body before allegedly committing suicide.\nAuthorities are conducting an investigation into the American football player's death. According to WBZ-TV, investigators believe 27-year-old Hernandez may have smoked a synthetic marijuana known as K2 hours before his death.\nDon't miss: Inside America's deadly opioid crisis: 'It feels like a horror movie'\nAuthorities claim that Hernandez hanged himself in his single cell with a bed sheet. He reportedly used various things to block his cell door before he was found at approximately 3.05am EST (8.05am GMT). Officers at Souza-Baranowski Correction Center in Shirley tried to save Hernandez's life and took him to UMass-Memorial Health Alliance Hospital in Leominster where he was pronounced dead by a physician at 4.07am.\nHernandez's former agent and lawyer maintain that there was no way the ex-NFL player would have committed suicide because he was not suicidal. \"The family and legal team is shocked and surprised at the news of Aaron's death,\" defence lawyer Jose Baez said in a statement to the Boston Herald.\nMost popular: Trump's son plays football in full Arsenal gear at White House\n\"There were no conversations or correspondence from Aaron to his family or legal team that would have indicated anything like this was possible. Aaron was looking forward to an opportunity for a second chance to prove his innocence,\" Baez said. \"Those who love and care about him are heartbroken and determined to find the truth surrounding his untimely death. We request that authorities conduct a transparent and thorough investigation.\"\nBaez also said his law firm would conduct its own probe on Hernandez's death.\nBrian Murphy, Hernandez's former agent, also claimed there was \"no chance\" the former athlete committed suicide. \"Absolutely no chance he took his own life. Chico was not a saint, but my family and I loved him and he would never take his own life,\" Murphy tweeted.\nOn Friday (14 April), a Boston jury found Hernandez not guilty of the 2012 deaths of two men, Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado. Hernandez was serving a life sentence after being convicted in 2015 of the 2013 death of semi-pro football player Odin Lloyd.\nAccording to the Boston Globe, Hernandez may have died an innocent man in the state of Massachusetts due to an archaic legal principle known as \"abatement ab initio\". Hernandez was appealing his conviction and because he died before exhausting his legal appeals, his case would revert to its status at the beginning.\nHernandez's appellate attorney, John M Thompson, told the Globe he would file to vacate the conviction. That move could be challenged by the Bristol County District Attorney Thomas M Quinn III's office or the Lloyd family.\nYou may be interested in:\n'The Devil controlled me' says old man jailed after

Ryan Gosling. Not the Ryan Gosling , you understand, but a weak simulacrum of the Canadian actor \u2013 a barista called Ben with three key Gosling markers: 1) a soft side parting; 2) a white T-shirt, its sleeves rolled twice; and 3) small, naive tattoos. Ben was preparing a flat white for another Gosling, who was in conversation with yet another. And so, I thought, the old adage is true: you\u2019re never more than six feet from a Gosling. Once you get your eye in, he\u2019s everywhere.\nAt some point in the past few years, Ryan Gosling went from indie actor to representative of a whole type of modern masculinity. And if you were under any doubt as to the pervasiveness of Gosling beyond the barista, further proof: Justin Trudeau in his slimline suit at the Juno awards ; Barack Obama louche in an off-duty linen suit; Gary Lineker , punditing, in tight-fitting shirts; slim Dan Stevens on the red carpet; even Ed Sheeran , freshly inked. All modern men with good hair, all would-be Goslings.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Get the Gosling look (from left): Barack Obama, Dan Stevens, Ed Sheeran, Gary Lineker, Justin Trudeau. Photograph: Getty Images \nRegardless of age and size, many men these days have the infamous Gosling hallmarks: side parting, tight shirt, a turbo cleanliness (not just Lineker, but the entire Match Of The Day pundit line-up attempt this look). The appeal is his wardrobe\u2019s simplicity: it\u2019s got a touch of the hipster, but without the irritation; a bit of metrosexual, but without the faff. Your archetypal Gosling man wears slim-cut suits, tight shirts and discreet jewellery. He mixes high street with designer, cares about trainers, but likely relaxes in Gap. He exists in a uniform of white T-shirts, black jeans and Redwing boots and probably spends \u00a3800 on a souvenir jacket but maintains his look is classic, with an edge, much like the man himself. If high fashion can feel alienating \u2013 and right now, with hyper-masculine streetwear and Russian-lad tracksuits at its cutting edge, it certainly can \u2013 then Gosling\u2019s look is a balm.\nTake the silk jacket Gosling wore in Drive (directed by Nicolas Winding Refn), which was then borrowed five years later by Louis Vuitton and Gucci. \u201cGosling became the pin-up boy for the bomber jacket,\u201d says fashion writer Simon Chilvers, \u201cand that look has become a symbol for the relaxed man.\u201d Too studiedly insouciant to be edgy, too well dressed to wear a tracksuit, that\u2019s Gosling: accessible, green, appealing to both men and women. As my hairdresser, who has Gosling hair, says, \u201cIt\u2019s just easier to dress like him than not.\u201d\nIt all started just over 10 years ago, when Gosling appeared as a benevolent addict teacher in Half Nelson . One Oscar nomination later (always the bridesmaid), he had shifted from Mickey Mouse child star and The Notebook pin-up to Hollywood A-list. Roles in Drive and Blue Valentine placed him in that modern canon of flawed Hollywood anti-heroes grappling with masculinity and human connection. In the following years, Gosling the brand was distilled and drunk with gay abandon by men between the age of 21 and 45 searching for a look, a role model and a way to pull. La La Land cemented the emotional pin-up status, except with added feeling and jazz, and his forthcoming role as a lovesick troubadour in Song To Song will do little to shift this perception.\nHe represents an idealised version of masculinity: not too good-looking, approachable, a little frayed around the edges\n\nPopular culture can\u2019t get enough. People magazine tried to name Gosling their sexiest man of the year on four separate occasions, and he reportedly refused each time. And there\u2019s plenty more where that came from: a Gosling-themed Easter egg hunt in New York, a Gosling weather app, Gosling colouring-in books. The Hey, Girl! memes , which place pithy feminist theory next to images of his face, were sparked by some feminist comments he made in interviews (such as: \u201cI think women are better than men\u2026 stronger. More evolved\u201d), and bred like knotweed on the internet.\nThen there was the series of Vines created by a vlogger in which Gosling repeatedly turns his head away from an oncoming spoonful of cereal (\u201cRyan Gosling won\u2019t eat his cereal\u201d). Following the vlogger\u2019s death two years later (aged 27), Gosling posted a tribute Vine in which he did, finally, eat his cereal. Some attempts to break the internet have been more successful than others: in February, a German prank duo sent a barely passable lookalike on stage posing as him to accept an award . In many ways we can blame social media for this bordeline hysterical interest. Gosling\u2019s appeal grew in direct tandem with Tumblr: he is the pin-up of Generation Snapchat, boyfriend to the internet.\nSure, Gosling is well dressed, a decent actor and pretty enough, but here\u2019s the rub: he\u2019s not actually that good-looking. The components are there \u2013 6ft tall, kempt hair, bright, puppy-dog eyes \u2013 but it\u2019s not an intimidating beauty. Given the calibre of Hollywood pin-ups, generation by generation \u2013 Marlon Brando, James Dean (proto-Gosling, but hotter), Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio \u2013 how did we end up with someone so relatively bland on our bedroom walls?\n\u201cHe seems to have been created in a laboratory,\u201d says Samuel Muston, deputy editor of Mr Porter, \u201cwhich is of course fine in an uncle or boss or whatever, but a bit crap in a cinematic icon.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ryan Gosling: \u2018He seems to have been created in a laboratory.\u2019 Photograph: Joel Ryan/Invision/AP \nA casting agent based in LA, who wishes to remain anonymous because \u201cyou never know who might walk through the door\u201d, describes Gosling as a Hollywood \u201cJohn Doe\u201d and \u201cmore than a blank canvas \u2013 he\u2019s every canvas. Good-looking, but not too good-looking. The guy the girl thinks she can get, and that\u2019s what we want from our leading men.\u201d She adds: \u201cHe\u2019s what we call a personality actor, which I suppose makes him more than a pin-up. It makes him \u2018boyfriend material\u2019.\u201d\nAnother theory is psychological. \u201cOur attraction to Gosling is as much about personality as it is about looks,\u201d says Viren Swami, a professor of social psychology. \u201cHe represents an idealised version of masculinity: not too good-looking, approachable, a nice guy who is a little frayed around the edges.\u201d He is a tender kook: manly but self-deprecating, fit but forgettable. It\u2019s very hard to hate him because we don\u2019t know what we hate.\nThe agent thinks Gosling\u2019s bankability also comes down to what psychologists call \u201cexposure\u201d, or the power of suggestion. The more you see him, the more you fancy him. I ask my friend Josh, who is routinely compared to Gosling (some of his colleagues actually thought he was Ryan Gosling) about his experiences. He is a blue-eyed blond and has a similar build to the actor, but says he finds it baffling. \u201cI think some people just have Ryan Gosling on the mind and therefore see vague resemblances in people like me.\u201d\nBack in the cafe, I order a flat white and ask Ben, the barista, whether he thinks he looks like Ryan Gosling. He smiles and says no, telling me that\u2019s absurd. I look at the side-parted hair, the not-too-tight T-shirt, and realise he\u2019s lying. He is constantly told that he does \u2013 which is why he looks, talks and acts the way he does. But then, no true Gosling would admit to that, would he?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \u2018The more you see him, the more you fancy him.\u2019 Photograph: Joel Ryan/AP \nHow to spot a Gosling \nWears his hair in a smooth side parting.\nOwns 12 identical white cotton T-shirts.\nRolls T-shirt sleeves twice, and shirt sleeves to the elbow (adding a slim-fit blazer for formal occasions).\nOwns several pairs of identical relaxed jeans \u2013 slim, not skinny \u2013 always worn with a laced boot.\nRarely shaves \u201call the way\u201d.\nHas abs, but doesn\u2019t talk about the gym.\nLists the word \u201cfeminist\u201d in his Twitter profile.\nHas a naive \u201cstick and poke\u201d tattoo \u2013 and regrets it.\nDoes not believe in capitalism, but spends more than \u00a3180 on a statement pair of trousers.\nOnly dates older women.\nWears everything a size too small.\nSays: \u201cIf I ever mansplain, euthanise me.\u201d\nGhosts the women he\u2019s dating\u2026\n\u2026 yet lives to be objectified by them.\nTopics Fashion Weekend men's fashion special spring/summer 2017 features  ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ryan gosling", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lineker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ed sheeran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gary lineker", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samuel muston", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marlon brando", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin trudeau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "viren swami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pinterest ryan gosling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "josh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "porter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nelson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john doe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ben", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gosling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blue valentine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barack obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brad pitt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leonardo dicaprio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joel ryan/ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joel ryan/invision/ap", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "james dean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan stevens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louis vuitton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "simon chilvers", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook twitter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicolas winding refn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gucci", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook twitter pinterest", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "la", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mickey mouse", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-21T10:39:01.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "c0ada914a8d7c4722fcf2badc8be40ec00d24384", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOjyPSVW7fbXpnyUqykFBogyb.4Xt0CEshm_85Bf7Iaid3Jou07gBqijRSAlGehO2RjkJ2RBbd7_CwdDN9Fav.1I", "site_full": "www.huffingtonpost.com", "site": "huffingtonpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/feeds/verticals/religion/news.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Religion News on The Huffington Post", "title": "Jennifer Hudson Teaches Stephen Colbert A Thing Or Two About Gospel Music", "title_full": "Jennifer Hudson Teaches Stephen Colbert A Thing Or Two About Gospel Music", "published": "2017-04-20T02:23:13.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/58f7cf032600004500c4694a.jpeg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 139, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 961, "comments": 1, "shares": 961}, "gplus": {"shares": 3}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "c0ada914a8d7c4722fcf2badc8be40ec00d24384", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOjyPSVW7fbXpnyUqykFBogyb.4Xt0CEshm_85Bf7Iaid3Jou07gBqijRSAlGehO2RjkJ2RBbd7_CwdDN9Fav.1I", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Carol Kuruvilla", "published": "2017-04-20T02:23:13.000+03:00", "title": "Jennifer Hudson Teaches Stephen Colbert A Thing Or Two About Gospel Music", "text": "Jennifer Hudson Teaches Stephen Colbert A Thing Or Two About Gospel Music Jennifer Hudson's voice is a blessing to us all. \ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\ude4c \ud83d\ude4c By Carol Kuruvilla \nWhen the spirit moves Jennifer Hudson, she doesn\u2019t need much prompting to burst out in song. \nThe singer and actress spontaneously showed off her incredible vocal range while appearing as a guest on Stephen Colbert\u2019s \u201cThe Late Show\u201d on Monday. \nHudson, who is promoting her new Netflix movie \u201cSandy Wexler,\u201d told Colbert that she grew up singing gospel music at church.

The jacket incident shaped my interactions with potential dates to come. I developed a very thick skin, and after that I never called any boy. If someone was interested, they would have to be the initiator.\u201d\nMr. Martinbrough\u2019s reaction was less dramatic.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be bothered,\u201d he said. \u201cI was a late bloomer. I was into Japanese animation and comic books.\u201d\nOver the years, however, he found himself wondering if she was the one who got away. \u201cWhat if I had taken her up on her offer?\u201d he said. \u201cI looked for her on the web, but I wasn\u2019t sure how she spelled her name, so I could never find her.\u201d\nPhoto The couple would exchange vows while standing in a heart made of rose petals.

By then, he was living in Washington and drawing for DC Comics . Ms. Ross had also moved on. She was living on the Upper East Side, working as an assistant district attorney and dating someone she had met in law school.\nChance brought them together in 2008, when Mr. Martinbrough spotted Ms. Ross at a book party at the restaurant Barna, now closed, on Park Avenue South.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story He had returned to New York to visit his family and was supposed to attend the event with his sister, who unexpectedly had to work late and couldn\u2019t go. Mr. Martinbrough had been working relentlessly on an illustration project. This was his first social outing in months, so he decided to go alone.\n\u201cI was getting my coat from coat check, and I see this cute woman,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it was Ayanna but wasn\u2019t sure. When I turned around, she was standing in front of me. It was her, but she didn\u2019t recognize me. I tried to explain how I knew her, and she didn\u2019t believe me until I mentioned the jacket and camp.\u201d\nPhoto Guests at the wedding.

When I got close enough to him, he said, \u2018I think I know you.\u2019 He pronounced my name correctly [a-wanna], which no one does.\u201d She then believed he really must have known her.\nNumbers were exchanged. That night, Mr. Martinbrough couldn\u2019t stop thinking about her.\nWhile visiting his father the next day, his cellphone rang. Ms. Ross, who had finally remembered him and broken her \u201cI\u2019m not calling you, you have to call me\u201d rule, was on the line.\n\u201cI\u2019d never done that before,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic that I called the one guy who made me not want to be the aggressor because of what he did years ago.\u201d\nThis time, Mr. Martinbrough wasn\u2019t turned off but rather fond of her forwardness, which he now found refreshing.\nPhoto Ms. Ross hugging Alexander Smalls, a restaurateur in Harlem.

I didn\u2019t view her as pushy anymore because we were grown up. I thought she was charming.\u201d\nThey met for dinner. The next day it was lunch. Then again that same evening. Ms. Ross had to leave the next morning for Las Vegas. Mr. Martinbrough watched her pack. They talked all night. Neither went to sleep. Then he drove her to the airport. He extended his stay in New York by a week and was waiting at the arrivals hall for her when she returned.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story The roles had finally switched.\n\u201cI knew I wanted to marry her in the first month,\u201d Mr. Martinbrough said, \u201cbut having been married before, I swore I\u2019d wait at least three years into a relationship before doing it again.\u201d\nAnd although things between them moved fast, Ms. Ross didn\u2019t mind. She liked the man he had become.\nPhoto The mother of the bride at the reception. Credit Dolly Faibyshev for The New York Times Over the next six years, they became inseparable and took turns visiting each other over the weekends. Finally, sick of the commute, Ms. Ross moved in with Mr. Martinbrough.\nOn one of the unluckiest days of the year, Friday, Dec. 13, 2013, he proposed. Ms. Ross immediately said yes.\nNot everyone was alerted to the early love story.\n\u201cI had no idea she had a crush on him; we were just kids,\u201d said Douglas Coleman, 44, who was also a camper at Summer Pines that year. \u201cWhen they started dating and Shawn reintroduced me to her, he said, \u2018Do you realize who this is?\u2019 I couldn\u2019t believe it. To know they found each other, and that they\u2019re getting married, is fate. You have to give that some credibility.\u201d\nMr. Estrada added: \u201cAyanna\u2019s very good for Shawn. She\u2019s smart, and she challenges him. He really feels like his life has come together.\u201d\nPhoto Mr. Martinbrough. After their summer camp courtship, the couple met again in high school only to go their separate ways. A chance encounter in 2008 brought them together, this time for the long haul. Credit Dolly Faibyshev for The New York Times Before their wedding, several snafus happened: They received a text message that the three-piece student band they had hired, to pay tribute to their high school, was not coming; the Vera Wang suit Mr. Martinbrough had rented didn\u2019t fit; and Ms. Ross forgot the music for their cocktail hour. Then there was the weather. It didn\u2019t just rain, it poured. All day. Nonstop. The couple had rented the Sunset Terrace at the Chelsea Piers in Manhattan specifically for the sunset and the outdoor accessibility.\nThey fixed what they could. They hired a flutist. The groom wore a Calvin Klein suit from his closet. Ms. Ross\u2019s niece became the musical backup, plugging her iPhone into the speaker system. And the rain, well, that was out of their hands.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story \u201cI really wanted to kiss Shawn at 7:02, when the sun was supposed to set,\u201d said a very calm Ms. Ross, who was taking a quiet moment before heading downstairs to greet guests.\nThe groom was just as calm, and remained optimistic.\n\u201cRain is good luck,\u201d he said, looking at his bride. \u201cThe two of us are here together celebrating our love.

He lights up my heart.\u201d\nMr. Williams pronounced them husband and wife, and as they began to kiss, a large boat made a surprise appearance, seemingly from nowhere.

This question lies at the heart of the Kosovo-born Finnish writer Pajtim Statovci\u2019s internationally acclaimed debut, \u201cMy Cat Yugoslavia,\u201d a strange, haunting and utterly original exploration of displacement and desire.\nStatovci interweaves the stories of Emine, a young Kosovan bride, and her son, Bekim, whom the aftershocks of exile continue to roil three decades after her fateful wedding to his father. Bekim is a studious gay loner isolated by anxiety, sexuality and the struggle of having grown up a refugee in Finland. Despite a childhood history with ophidiophobic nightmares, he buys a boa constrictor and sets it loose in his apartment. The snake takes up residence under his sofa, driving away his few human visitors, and quickly adopts strangely companionable behaviors more befitting a dog than a reptile.\nAn urgent longing for love belies Bekim\u2019s inscrutability. We find echoes of that same longing in Emine\u2019s girlhood reminiscences. She is a fiercely intelligent daydreamer at odds with her strict and superstitious father. In one of the novel\u2019s most affecting passages, she realizes that the objective of her education has always been to make her a more suitable wife; she has \u201cnever heard of a single female politician, a female teacher or lawyer.\u201d Having reconciled that she can no longer allow herself to dream, she wonders what she can hope for instead. Understanding that it can only be a handsome, generous husband, she promptly throws up. Her life is upended by a fleeting roadside encounter with Bajram, a rou\u00e9 from the neighboring village who asks for her hand in marriage on what is essentially a whim.\nThroughout their lives, mother and son share echoing preoccupations with domesticity and sensuality, and are particularly attentive to the world\u2019s tactile and olfactory details. They share, too, a steadfast refusal to give up the truth of their inner selves in the face of violent and violating masculinity.\nAt a gay bar one evening, Bekim falls under the spell of a singing, dancing cat. I will admit to being more than a little skeptical of this character, loyal as I am to Mikhail Bulgakov\u2019s \u201cThe Master and Margarita\u201d and its most iconic figure: Behemoth, that formidable hedonist against whom all fictional felines must be measured. I am happy to report that Statovci\u2019s cat manages to mark its own literary turf. Its ostentatiousness and absurdity make Behemoth look comparably stable. This cat \u2014 a vainglorious, labile, impulsively abusive bigot, in whom Bajram\u2019s judgment and Bekim\u2019s own worst fears combine \u2014 captivates Bekim. After he allows it to move in with him, things quickly go wrong, forcing him to take stock of his past and reimagine his future.\nPhoto Such a dazzling figure can make other aspects of a narrative seem tame. At certain points, the novel loses some of its wild, wonderful energy. Nuanced interiority gives way to action \u2014 sometimes, unnecessarily, in the third person. In an effort to compress time, Statovci is forced to paint Emine\u2019s and Bekim\u2019s respective heartbreaks \u2014 displacement; poverty; shame; the xenophobia of their Finnish neighbors; the impregnability of new languages and customs; the eventual feeling that one belongs to neither one\u2019s old nor new country \u2014 in broad and recognizable strokes. These obstacles would be better served by the same vivid detailing with which Emine\u2019s wedding preparations and Bekim\u2019s eventual chance at happiness are rendered.\nBut it is faint criticism to say there should be more of a book, and Statovci\u2019s literary gifts are prodigious. His sentences are lean and precise. He defies expectation, denies explanation, and excels at the most difficult aspect of storytelling: building a complex humanity for even his most deplorable characters. He does not pretend to offer a journey that every reader will appreciate.

The next morning, another political commentator and a news anchor revealed their own mistreatment at Fox News and said they\u2019d essentially been told that there was no recourse when the perpetrators happened to be Bill O\u2019Reilly or Roger Ailes. These are conversations that wouldn\u2019t have taken place on air just 10 months ago, when Ailes ruled Fox News and O\u2019Reilly reigned as the king of cable news. But the floodgates began to open once Ailes resigned in disgrace in July after a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by former \u201cFox & Friends\u201d co-host Gretchen Carlson prompted allegations from dozens of women. And more women have been speaking out since O\u2019Reilly exited the building Wednesday following protests and an advertiser exodus \u2015 both in response to a report that sexual harassment settlements had been secretly paid out to several women. Both men have denied the claims against them. The Washington Post via Getty Images Bill O'Reilly and Roger Ailes both left Fox News in disgrace. The departures of Fox News\u2019 founder and top-rated star aren\u2019t the end of the story, however. Details continue to seep out about the toxic culture they are said to have helped create and foster. There are ongoing sexual harassment and racial discrimination lawsuits against Fox News and top executives, including co-president Bill Shine. On-air contributor Julie Roginsky claimed that Shine retaliated against her after she spoke up against Ailes. In addition, there\u2019s a federal probe into whether the Murdoch family-led parent company 21st Century Fox properly notified investors about settlements with female accusers. If the past 24 hours are any indication, additional revelations are sure to follow.

By Michael Calderone On Wednesday night, a female political analyst described being dismissed as just another \u201cblonde\u201d when providing her opinion on Fox News. The next morning, another political commentator and a news anchor revealed their own mistreatment at Fox News and said they\u2019d essentially been told that there was no recourse when the perpetrators happened to be Bill O\u2019Reilly or Roger Ailes. These are conversations that wouldn\u2019t have taken place on air just 10 months ago, when Ailes ruled Fox News and O\u2019Reilly reigned as the king of cable news. But the floodgates began to open once Ailes resigned in disgrace in July after a sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by former \u201cFox & Friends\u201d co-host Gretchen Carlson prompted allegations from dozens of women. And more women have been speaking out since O\u2019Reilly exited the building Wednesday following protests and an advertiser exodus \u2015 both in response to a report that sexual harassment settlements had been secretly paid out to several women. Both men have denied the claims against them. The Washington Post via Getty Images Bill O'Reilly and Roger Ailes both left Fox News in disgrace. The departures of Fox News\u2019 founder and top-rated star aren\u2019t the end of the story, however. Details continue to seep out about the toxic culture they are said to have helped create and foster. There are ongoing sexual harassment and racial discrimination lawsuits against Fox News and top executives, including co-president Bill Shine. On-air contributor Julie Roginsky claimed that Shine retaliated against her after she spoke up against Ailes. In addition, there\u2019s a federal probe into whether the Murdoch family-led parent company 21st Century Fox properly notified investors about settlements with female accusers. If the past 24 hours are any indication, additional revelations are sure to follow.

(Reuters) - The Sisters of the Valley, California's self-ordained \"weed nuns,\" are on a mission to heal and empower women with their cannabis products.\nBased near the town of Merced in the Central Valley, which produces over half of the fruit, vegetables and nuts grown in the United States, the Sisters of the Valley grow and harvest their own cannabis plants.\nThe sisterhood stresses that its seven members, despite the moniker, do not belong to any order of the Catholic Church.\n\"We're against religion, so we're not a religion. We consider ourselves Beguine revivalists, and we reach back to pre-Christian practices,\u201d said 58-year-old Sister Kate, who founded the sisterhood in 2014.\nThe group says its Holy Trinity is the marijuana plant, specifically hemp, a strain of marijuana that has very low levels of Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the psychoactive compound in the plant.\nMembers turn the hemp into cannabis-based balms and ointments, which they say have the power to improve health and wellbeing.\nMore than two dozen U.S. states have legalized some form of marijuana for medical or recreational use, but the drug remains illegal at the federal level. California legalized recreational use of marijuana in November 2016.\n\"A sister becomes a sister through a commercial relationship and earning a wage or a commission and we want to grow this way because we want to free the women, we don't want to make them more dependent,\" said Kate, whose real name is Christine Meeusen.\nShe said the group had roughly $750,000 in sales last year, the most since it started selling products in January 2015.\nPresident Donald Trump's administration and his Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a longtime critic of marijuana legalization, have worried some in the country's nascent legalized marijuana industry.\nBut the \"weed nuns\" say the new administration has strengthened their resolve.\n\"The thing Trump has done for us is put a fire under our butts to get launched in another country,\" said Kate. \"Our response to Trump is Canada.\" The group makes online sales to Canda, and hopes to launch an operation there in two months.\nSister Kate adopted the nun persona after she took part in an Occupy Wall Street protest in 2011 dressed as a Catholic nun, a look that led her to be known by protesters as \"Sister Occupy.\u201d\n\u201cWe've gotten a few hate calls but, by and far, the Catholics understand what we're doing,\" she said.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "omar younis", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jeff sessions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine meeusen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "canda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "catholic church", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "valley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "calif.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merced", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "merced", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "central valley", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-21T04:31:08.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "52a9fa947b700f5a41dc909e1ceaf8c6e67a59d5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_noY1di9e.CNqx4I_nT6CmATMXM2parMwBd3ktJ0A7ZgZF1Tq308bbktsAos9pz4UPLdzhoUPmXaYNw9GGVRY5C6XKeXGzLjivN_EwzXZimeY-", "site_full": "www.theguardian.com", "site": "theguardian.com", "site_section": "http://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/mar/19/rss.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "The Guardian", "title": "Viggo Mortensen calls Argentina president 'neoliberal braggart' | Film", "title_full": "Viggo Mortensen calls Argentina president 'neoliberal braggart' | Film | The Guardian", "published": "2017-04-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/83ff8fc971b74f0f0939b3993d6536e40b098965/0_5_594_356/master/594.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces%2Centropy&amp;bm=normal&amp;ba=bottom%2Cleft&amp;blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly91cGxvYWRzLmd1aW0uY28udWsvMjAxNi8wNS8yNS9vdmVybGF5LWxvZ28tMTIwMC05MF9vcHQucG5n&amp;s=0255956cbd8bcf16781a4a0073580354", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 170, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 947, "comments": 0, "shares": 947}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 5}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "52a9fa947b700f5a41dc909e1ceaf8c6e67a59d5", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSJlbPFf2vcZQ7DQwnenE_noY1di9e.CNqx4I_nT6CmATMXM2parMwBd3ktJ0A7ZgZF1Tq308bbktsAos9pz4UPLdzhoUPmXaYNw9GGVRY5C6XKeXGzLjivN_EwzXZimeY-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Uki Go\u00f1i", "published": "2017-04-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Viggo Mortensen calls Argentina president 'neoliberal braggart' | Film", "text": "At the climax of the epic movie trilogy Lord of the Rings, Viggo Mortensen rallies his dispirited comrades with a stirring call to arms delivered on horseback at the Black Gate of Mordor: \u201c This day, we fight! \u201d\nThis week, the Danish-American actor once again delivered a speech meant to breathe courage into his flagging crew. \nBut this time, his words were delivered in a somewhat gloomy internet video, and his enemy was not the Dark Lord and his hordes \u2013 it was the government of Argentina\u2019s conservative president, Mauricio Macri.\nThe 33-second clip \u2013 in which Mortensen describes Macri as a \u201cneoliberal braggart\u201d \u2013 has gone viral across Argentina, and cast a spotlight on an increasingly bitter row over rumoured changes to the way the country\u2019s film industry is financed. \nMortensen, who grew up in Argentina , took aim at Macri and his culture minister, Pablo Avelutto, over a draft \u201cdigital convergence\u201d bill with which Macri\u2019s government intends to update media legislation to cover online streaming entertainment.\n\nDetails of the bill have not been released, prompting speculation that the new legislation could involve cuts to state funding for the country\u2019s critically successful film industry. \nViggo Mortensen on actors behaving like babies and why he won't vote for Hillary Read more \nSpeaking in a light Argentinian accent, Mortensen said: \u201cArgentinian cinema finances itself, and is a source of pride for all Argentinians.

But for the first time in the series\u2019 run, there will finally be answers \u2015 and happy endings, too. \nDuring a conversation with The Huffington Post on Build Series Thursday, Lucy Hale confirmed the news that there will be \u201c more than one wedding \u201d in Season 7B. \n\u201cThis whole season, in general, is just very romantic. You get to see all of the couples together and there\u2019s a wedding ... or are there two weddings? Yes, there\u2019s one main wedding ... hmmm, I don\u2019t know if I was supposed to say there are two weddings, but whatever, we\u2019ll just let that slide,\u201d Hale joked, getting a bit nervous about her spoilery slip before putting it behind her, adding, \u201cPregnancies, kids, yeah. The girls are grown up.\u201d \nBut whose nuptials will be featured on the show? Spoby ? Haleb ? Or will Aria and Ezra take the cake? \nLast October, Ian Harding, who plays Ezra, shared a photo of Hale on Instagram , thanking her for being his sidekick throughout the series. But, he apparently forgot that she was wearing a veil, and fans, obviously, freaked out. So, Aria is probably going to be one of the brides, right? \n\u201cIt\u2019s been such a roller coaster of a romance, but I want to say there\u2019s a happy ending,\u201d Hale said of engaged couple Ezria. Eric McCandless via Getty Images \nAccording to Hale, weddings aren\u2019t all we have to look forward to. It sounds like Aria turns to the \u201cdark side\u201d (which just makes us think she\u2019s definitely, most likely, maybe A/A.D./Uber A ). \n\u201cThe board game plays a big part in the last nine episodes,\u201d she explained. Obviously, all of the girls will get a turn and it puts them in very uncomfortable situations \u2015 life-or-death situations. And, Aria, it really pits her against the girls. For the first time it\u2019s little Aria against the rest of them, so things get weird.\u201d \nHale continued, \u201cAria gets to do some real cool stuff this season. This was the first time in the course of the show that I went to [showrunner I. Marlene King] and I went to the writers and was like, \u2018Please, can Aria just do something really cool and different for the last 10 episodes?\u2019 And they gave me my way, and I was really surprised. Not only was it stuff I never got to do on the show, but I got to do things I\u2019ve never done in acting, period.\u201d \nGreen-screen action? Yup, they\u2019ll be some of that. A post shared by Lucy Hale (@lucyhale) on Sep 20, 2016 at 7:01am PDT \nHale said playing a different, darker side of Aria was fun and challenging, but it will for sure shift the dynamic between the Liars. \n\u201cShe does some crazy stuff,\u201d she told HuffPost. \u201cIt puts everything at stake \u2015 it puts her friendships, her relationships at stake \u2015 and there are times when you\u2019re like, \u2018Whose side is she on?\u2019\u201d \nThe 27-year-old actress loves to read all of the theories fans of the show come up with, and appreciates every wacky, illogical moment the \u201cPretty Little Liars\u201d writers decide to toss their way. Still, she has a favorite storyline (and she can\u2019t wait for you to watch it unfold). \n\u201cThis sounds clich\u00e9, but, the very ending is just my favorite of all,\u201d Hale said. \u201cA is a lot closer than we think, you guys ... it\u2019s nuts!\u201d \n\u201cPretty Little Liars\u201d airs Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET on Freeform.

Those paid between \u00a315,000 and \u00a350,000 made up two-thirds of UK taxpayers.\nSpeaking on Thursday, Thornberry said wealth would be relative to other factors. \u201cI think there are many people on \u00a370,000 who may well feel that their circumstances are such that they are not rich,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.\n\u201cMany people feel that the elite has not been taken on. People who don\u2019t think the rules apply to them. People who feel they can keep their wealth offshore and avoid paying taxes.\n\u201cThere has begun to be a view around that ordinary people are the only ones who should be paying taxes and it\u2019s about time that stopped. It\u2019s been glacial and we can see there are people who take the mickey, and it\u2019s not fair.\u201d\nLaunching Labour\u2019s election campaign later on Thursday in Westminster, Jeremy Corbyn will pledge to \u201coverturn the rigged system\u201d \u2013 singling out \u201ctax-avoiding multinational companies\u201d.\nThe Labour leader will deny that the election is \u201ca foregone conclusion\u201d and say he will refuse to play by the normal rules of politics.\n\u201cThey say I don\u2019t play by the rules \u2013 their rules,\u201d Corbyn will say. \u201cWe can\u2019t win, they say, because we don\u2019t play their game.

The attorney general\u2019s office in Venezuela said 11 people had died of electrocution and gunshot wounds \u201cin acts of violence\u201d in El Valle, a neighborhood of mixed loyalties, where armored vehicles struggled to contain crowds of looters. In Petare, a working-class section in eastern Caracas, a protester was shot dead at the entrance to the city\u2019s largest barrio, said Carlos Ocariz, the district mayor.

Watch in Times Video \u00bb embed Liang-Ming Mora, 43, a resident of El Valle, described watching from the window of her high-rise apartment as her neighbors threw objects at National Guardsmen and residents of a nearby area descended onto the streets, burning tires and looting stores. The crowd, she said, moved through the neighborhood, destroying a large supermarket, a liquor store and other businesses. \n  \u201cThey wanted to loot the bakery, too,\u201d Ms. Mora said, but people shouted, \u201cNo, not the bakery, no!\u201d \u2014 apparently sparing one of the few places that could still supply the neighborhood with bread. The clashes are a challenge to Venezuela\u2019s opposition politicians, who have been trying to channel resentment over President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s growing power into a peaceful protest movement. Many thousands of people gathered on Wednesday and Thursday, flooding the capital and parts of other cities , to demand that elections be scheduled.

Credit Meridith Kohut for The New York Times The government has responded by trying to repress the protests with rubber bullets and tear gas. Making matters worse, bitterness against the government has been boiling over as the country struggles with severe shortages of food and medicine, forcing Venezuelans to wait in lines for hours for basics like cornmeal. The anger was apparent into the early hours on Friday. In videos posted on social media, people screamed as gunshots were fired into dark streets and looters broke store windows. Protesters were captured on videos in cat-and-mouse games, throwing stones and other objects at soldiers. Fires burned in the streets. At one point during the night, clashes became so heavy that a nearby children\u2019s hospital was evacuated after a ward filled with tear gas. The government said security forces were responding to an attack on the hospital by opposition protesters. Mary Carmen Laguna Andrade, 23, who lives in El Valle, said she had watched as looters prowled the streets into the early hours of the morning.

Credit Earl Wilson/The New York Times This interview with Leila Janah , founder and chief executive of Samasource , an antipoverty nonprofit, and LXMI , a skin care line, was conducted and condensed by Adam Bryant . Q. Tell me about your early years. A. I was born in upstate New York. My parents came here in the late \u201970s from Mumbai, but my mom is half-Belgian. They were liberal intellectuals in India before they came here with nothing. But they had an education and a dream. My father had gone to a top engineering school. My mom had a degree in English literature, but back then, a degree from an Indian university wasn\u2019t recognized by employers or even grad schools, so she was chopping onions at Wendy\u2019s as her first job. And this is a woman who could recite passages from \u201cMacbeth\u201d verbatim, and people would ask her how she spoke such good English. It was kind of frustrating for her. Continue   My mother ended up going into computer science. She was very nontraditional. In some ways, it was helpful to see an example of someone who broke the mold. She always told me that the most important thing in life is to follow your passion and not to worry too much about convention and whether you\u2019re married or not married. \nAdvertisement But my parents ended up divorcing. I did not have a very stable family life. We moved 12 times when I was growing up. That\u2019s a lot of moving. The most important thing to my parents was that we went to good schools, and we never had the money for private schools. So my mom would research the best public schools, and we\u2019d move to those neighborhoods. But those were often wealthier neighborhoods that we really couldn\u2019t afford to live in. So I would get my clothes from thrift stores. Kids can be really cruel, and if you\u2019re the only brown kid, you\u2019re wearing weird clothes, you don\u2019t have TV at home and your parents have funny accents, then you\u2019re always an outcast. So how did you deal with that? It did create scar tissue. I didn\u2019t have a rosy childhood. But there\u2019s a lot of new work on adverse childhood experiences that shows they can affect you in one of two ways. I think it made me very resilient. There were moments when life just seemed so hard emotionally when I was a kid. But I think that gives you a level of resilience that helps you power through during the inevitable lows of being an entrepreneur. The biggest reason for success in entrepreneurship is not brilliance. It\u2019s not creative genius. It\u2019s the simple ability to not quit when things are really bad.

You are already subscribed to this email. Privacy Policy How does your background influence how you lead? I think many children who have faced issues at home have a tough time. They operate in a mode of hypervigilance, and I think a lot of entrepreneurs, especially, operate in this mode. You\u2019re constantly worried about trusting other people, and you\u2019re expecting the worst to happen all the time. That can be really good, but it can also be really destructive to close relationships with staff. And in many ways, as a C.E.O., your job is to really build an alternate family, to build a place where people feel comfortable taking risks, where they feel like they\u2019re not going to be punished and where they feel like they can speak out. For me, it\u2019s been a real evolution and a huge learning process. Other leadership lessons? There\u2019s an extreme tendency to take things personally as an entrepreneur, which is very separate, I think, from being hired as a C.E.O. As an entrepreneur, your mark is on every aspect of the company, from the first rug you buy to the email signatures. \nAdvertisement Continue   You feel like everything the company does is an extension of you. So if something happens that doesn\u2019t work, especially if you\u2019re a perfectionist \u2014 Type A child of Asian immigrants \u2014 you\u2019re likely to constantly blame yourself and take everything really personally, which is also just bad for employee morale, because the great people you hire have their own ways of doing things and are not extensions of you. You have to get good at ceding control and not taking things personally. I think even the best entrepreneurs have really struggled with that. For me, it\u2019s about not taking the failures personally and also not taking the successes personally, and realizing that the successes are the product of other people coming in and infusing their own life into ideas. How do you hire? It depends on the stage of the company. In the early stages, I\u2019m really looking for a sense of ownership. Are they going to sweat all of the details as much as I do? Are they going to put in the crazy outsize effort to make something work, which often means doing the work of three or four people in the early stages? That shifts as a company matures, but that sense of ownership, especially in key management hires, is still vital. To me, that will compensate for a lack of experience or specific skills, which can often be learned, especially if it\u2019s about learning a new industry or something. You can teach yourself virtually anything on the internet now. So how do you test for that? Reference checking is one of the most important things you can do. We also have people essentially come up with a business plan for their area. You can tell by the way someone thinks about an issue whether they\u2019re going to take ownership or expect you to give them a plan. What career and life advice do you give to new college grads? You have to be willing to embrace the struggle. If you want anything great in life, you have to be willing to go through the very dark and painful moments of building something. Nothing great has ever come out of a lot of easy days. We\u2019re in a world where so many things are available at the touch of a button. We forget that only through struggle is our character really tested. \nEach week, Adam Bryant talks with top executives about leadership. Follow him on Twitter: @nytcorneroffice .

(AP) \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. will be targeting more than just Montana's Republican voters on Friday and Saturday when he helps Greg Gianforte campaign for an open U.S. House seat. A prairie dog hunt is also on the agenda for the four-city tour for President Donald Trump's son and Gianforte, a technology entrepreneur up against Democrat Rob Quist in the May 25 election for the seat vacated by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke.\n\"As good Montanans, we want to show good hospitality to people,\" Gianforte said. \"What can be more fun than to spend an afternoon shooting the little rodents?\"\nTrump is lending Gianforte some star power to fuel his campaign after Republican congressional candidates had close calls in special elections in Kansas and Georgia. The president's son, an avid hunter and angler who last visited Montana in November, is looking to shore up support from the hunting-friendly state after his father won Montana by 20 percentage points over Democrat Hillary Clinton.\nPrairie dog hunting is a way for landowners to control the population of the rodents, classified as \"agricultural pests\" because of the damage they can do to crops. They are also a nongame species, meaning there are no hunting limits or hunting seasons. Killing them is a popular pastime among some hunters who looking to keep their shooting skills sharp during the offseason when they can't hunt wild animals like deer and elk.\nHowever, prairie dogs are also listed as a species of concern by the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks because their numbers have declined and because of threats like disease.\nTheir numbers haven't dropped to the point that protective measures must be taken so that they're managed like other wildlife, though, agency spokesman Greg Lemon said.\n\"They are a species of concern but also a species not in need of management,\" he said.\nThe Humane Society of the United States condemned Trump's hunting plans, saying prairie dogs are an important species for the Great Plains.\nMore than 100 other animals depend on the prairie dog as food or move into the burrows they dig, said Lindsey Sterling Krank, the organization's director for its Prairie Dog Coalition.\nNow is the time year when prairie dogs are still nursing their new offspring, meaning hunters who shoot lactating females are condemning the pups to starvation, Sterling Krank said.\n\"I would love to take Donald Trump Jr. out with a spotting scope and shoot the prairie dog with our cameras,\" Sterling Krank said. \"Shooting a prairie dog colony is not a good conservation message.\"\nGianforte, whose campaign has focused on gun rights, dismissed the organization's concerns.\n\"Clearly they've never shot a prairie dog,\" he said. \"They don't know how much fun it is.\"\nThe Montana race is drawing increasing interest after the Georgia and Kansas elections, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders has pledged to come to Montana next month to campaign for Quist, a popular musician who fronted the Mission Mountain Wood Band.\nGianforte, who is trying to rebound from last November's election loss to Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock, has already received a boost from outside spending from national Republican groups like the Congressional Leadership Fund.\nQuist campaign spokeswoman Tina Olechowski declined to comment.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "donald trump jr.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "trump jr.", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hillary clinton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg gianforte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg lemon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tina olechowski", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lindsey sterling krank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve bullock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sterling krank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernie sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gianforte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan zinke", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mission mountain wood band", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democrat rob quist", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "montana department of fish", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "interior", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prairie dog coalition", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "humane society of the united states", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "montana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helena", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mont.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vermont", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kansas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "great plains", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-22T01:25:57.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "ee0b3618ce8b0f9653d176bfc2582ce0a9d85163", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giU8x5k.aT.8hZVD83UrUelvcWBn1mAAHLavTcbZHuE3.cJbttSrcjkoV7Z4CdezS2uPDcpT0ftUaQTUNkwK.y14Yvsoh1dNIFnyv.5yacjGayKoFnifP7RBtigZImMa44EqWsNfrmcey", "site_full": "www.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://www.yahoo.com/movies/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Yahoo Movies", "title": "What About Han?

And at the end of the film [warning: spoilers] , Shaw and Toretto make amends, paving the way for Statham\u2019s character to become a quasi member of the squad. But, as many fans are wondering, doesn\u2019t that twist mean that Dom has, in effect, forgiven the formerly villainous Shaw for killing one of his best friends \u2014 Sung Kang\u2019s laid-back driver Han? As you may remember, Shaw is the man responsible for Han\u2019s death in  The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift \u2014  although, in the twisted timeline of the series , this wasn\u2019t \u201crevealed\u201d until the end of Fast & Furious 6.  A new piece in the   Los Angeles Times  addresses this perplexing about-face for Dom, who\u2019s nothing if not consumed with loyalty to family. While it seems like this is a glaring inconsistency, cast and crew members seem to be indicating that perhaps Han will factor in some way in future installments.\nSung Kang in \u2018Fast & Furious 6.\u2019 (Photo: Giles Keyte/\u00a9Universal Pictures/Courtesy Everett Collection) More Despite fan theories online that Han is still alive, screenwriter and producer Chris Morgan tells the L.A. Times that he did indeed die in Tokyo Drift . But when pressed about whether a #justiceforHan hashtag is necessary, he responded by saying: \u201cI can tell you this: We will definitely be talking more about Han. Look, I am literally the biggest Han/Sung Kang fan in the world. But I would say this: From the initial conceit of Deckard, I\u2019ve never really thought of him as a bad guy. He was definitely against our team, but he\u2019s a guy with a code who loves his family.\u201d\nStatham himself was also coy about future revelations, stating about the character\u2019s death scene: \u201cYou know, that whole episode has not fully detailed exactly what happened. I\u2019m not going to say anything more than that! But [writer-producer Chris Morgan] likes to annoy the fans and please the fans, and get all these angry protests. So, more to come.\u201d\nCould Han reemerge in the franchise? Given that the series has previously twisted timelines and brought Michelle Rodriguez\u2019s Letty back from the dead, it\u2019s not that  big a leap.

The cynics were soon put in their place by the hawks of Trumpelson News Inc., the all-devouring media group started in 2022 with a $38 billion bequest from Sheldon Adelson.

One such family was Cliona and Sue, a married lesbian couple who both breastfeed their toddler daughter and infant triplets \u2015 a boy and two girls. Johanna King Photography Cliona and Sue both nurse their toddler daughter and infant triplets. \nA breastfeeding mother herself, King came across Cliona and Sue\u2019s story through a parenting and breastfeeding support group called Cuidiu. When she reached out about photographing them in their home, they were delighted to participate . \nKing told HuffPost photographing the family was a very relaxed experience. \u201cI felt instantly welcome when Cliona opened the door, and I believe they felt at ease too,\u201d she said. \nThe photographer documented the family as Sue rotated their then-6-month-old triplets to nurse two at a time. Johanna King Photography \u201cI felt instantly welcome when Cliona opened the door, and I believe they felt at ease too,\u201d she the photographer. \n\u201cCliona and Sue\u2019s session wasn\u2019t really different from any of the other sessions apart from the fact that their family is quite extraordinary,\u201d King recalled. \u201cI don\u2019t think you will come across many families of two mothers feeding simultaneously four children with four boobs!\u201d \nStill, she added, it was like other photo shoots in its focus on capturing the reality of the family\u2019s life in that moment, so they could look back years later and remember how it felt. \nSue gave birth to their triplets and Cliona delivered their first daughter, Aoife. Both women struggled at the start of their breastfeeding journeys. When Aoife was born, Cliona turned to formula due to latch issues. Once they discovered the baby had tongue tie, lactation consultants helped Cliona deal with the issue and relactate . Johanna King Photography Both women struggled at the start of their breastfeeding journeys. \nTheir triplets were born two months early and spent about a month in the hospital. \u201cDoctors and nurses wanted to establish a routine and know exactly how much the babies were getting,\u201d said Cliona. \u201cSue expressed around the clock, despite the fact that she was exhausted, recovering from a C-section, suffering from serious nipple damage, and at one point got mastitis.\u201d \nAll of the triplets also had tongue tie, but eventually, \u201cafter a lot of tears,\u201d Sue managed to nurse the three babies. Johanna King Photography The triplets were born two months early and spent about a month in the hospital. \nHaving another breastfeeding mom in the family can be an asset for Sue, though she does the vast majority of the triplets\u2019 feedings. \n\u201cIt is great that I am able to help out now and again \u2015 for example if one of them has a hospital appointment, I can bring them in and know that I can breastfeed them if they get upset, and we don\u2019t need to bother bringing a bottle of expressed milk with us,\u201d Cliona explained. \u201cSue has also fed the older child a few times, although she doesn\u2019t show much interest as she says it is \u2018too spicy!\u2019\u201d \nOn the day of the photo shoot, King stayed for two hours documenting the family. She told HuffPost she was struck by Sue\u2019s methodical approach to rotating between all three babies as she nursed. Johanna King Photography \u201cIt was quite amazing to see how much she cared that they all got enough, even if it meant no break for her,\" the photographer recalled. \n\u201cIt was quite amazing to see how much she cared that they all got enough, even if it meant no break for her. The babies were 6 months old and exclusively breastfed. I don\u2019t think Sue got more than 30 minutes a day (and night) without a baby latched on.\u201d \nAs a sleep-deprived mother herself, King felt for Sue but said she was glad to see how much support she gets from Cliona and her own mother as well. Johanna King Photography Sue and Cliona have supported each other through their breastfeeding challenges. \nThe couple loved the finished photos of their family. \u201cI think they reflect what our house is like \u2015 the madness and sheer chaos of it,\u201d said Cliona. \u201cLike I said to Johanna, it is easy to forget with all the stress and exhaustion that there are beautiful moments too. I am so happy that we will have these gorgeous photos to remind us what it was like when the gang was so young.\u201d \nCliona hopes that people who see their photos learn that it\u2019s possible to breastfeed triplets, though it may take perseverance. \n\u201cThere is no easy way to feed triplets \u2015 when they were on bottles it was a nightmare doing all the cleaning and managing feeds \u2015 but this is definitely the best way for our family,\u201d she said. Johanna King Photography \"I am so happy that we will have these gorgeous photos to remind us what it was like when the gang was so young,\" Cliona told HuffPost. \n\u201cI also hope that people see the happiness in our family, even if the house is messy and our hair hasn\u2019t been washed in days!\u201d she added. \nThe photographer said she was honored to work with Cliona, Sue and their family. \u201cI love taking breastfeeding photos because of what it means to the mothers,\u201d she explained, adding that she hopes people feel the love in their home.

(Photo: Gregg DeGuire/FilmMagic) More It\u2019s been one year since Patton Oswalt \u2019s wife, author Michelle McNamara, died unexpectedly in her sleep. The actor has been raising their 8-year-old daughter , Alice, as a single father ever since. To mark the anniversary of McNamara\u2019s death, the 48-year-old comedian posted a message to Facebook . \u201cOne year in. Another year starting. It\u2019s awful, but it\u2019s not fatal,\u201d he writes, recalling how his day started on April 21, 2016. He let Michelle sleep in while he took their daughter to school. \u201cI stopped on the way home to buy Michelle an Americano and left it on her bedside table around 9:30 a.m. Went up to my office, did some writing, answered some e-mails, Tweeted some thoughts on Prince dying,\u201d he shares. \u201cThere was an art show at Alice\u2019s school in the afternoon and my wife and I were going to go, get dragged around the room by Alice as she chattered about her artwork and the work of her classmates. Except instead I came back down into the house and the life I knew was gone.\u201d He continues, \u201cI\u2019m one year into this new life \u2014 one I never even imagined, and I can imagine some pretty pessimistic and dark contingencies, some stomach-freezing \u2018what ifs.\u2019 But not this one. This one had such a flat, un-poetic immediacy. The world gazes at you like a hungry but indifferent reptile when you\u2019re widowed.\u201d Oswalt reveals he just took his wedding ring off for the first time. \u201cRemoving the ring was removing the last symbol of denial of who I was now, and what my life is, and what my responsibilities are,\u201d he says. \u201cI put the ring in this little box I\u2019d had made \u2026 and filled with it random trinkets and scraps of our life leading up to marriage. The first movie we went to after moving in with each other, the first movie premiere we went to, hotel keys and love notes and pictures.\u201d View photos Patton Oswalt\u2019s memory box of his wife. (Photo: Patton Oswalt via Facebook) More The comedian posted photos of the box along with one with Michelle. \u201cMichelle brought me nothing but happiness. You see it in our faces,\u201d he writes, referencing the below picture. \u201cThat was taken literally a month after we started going out. Look at us. We knew this was it.\u201d View photos Happier times: Patton Oswalt and Michelle McNamara. (Photo: Patton Oswalt via Facebook) More The ring goes with the \u201chappy stuff.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not making today any sort of dark ritual or painful memorial. No graveside visit. Those are for when Alice and I have something exciting to say to her,\u201d he reveals. \u201cNo candle lighting or balloon launching. We think of her every day\u2026 So why light a flame that will die, or release a balloon that will disappear? Michelle\u2019s gone but she wasn\u2019t the kind of soul that disappears or dies out. \u201cI\u2019m gonna pick Alice up at school later. She wants to go to a pet store and buy \u2018worms that will grow into beetles,\u2019\u201d Oswalt says. \u201cShe\u2019s becoming a cool bug girl and Michelle would have thought that was hilarious (Michelle HATED insects). Then we\u2019ll go get ice cream. Or go home and play a game. I\u2019m her dad. I want to make her days fun.\u201d Read More Still, The Goldbergs narrator acknowledges his world is different. \u201cI\u2019ve become friends with a lot of other people who share my tragedy. We\u2019re an informal, subtle little club,\u201d he says. \u201cNo rankings or initiation ceremonies or secret handshakes. And no, we don\u2019t \u2018see it [in] each other\u2019s eyes\u2019 or \u2018sense it without saying it.\u2019 We went through something that transformed us but, for the most part, we keep it together. We lost someone who made us live better in the world. It would be an insult to them [to] suddenly live badly in this world.\u201d Oswalt continues: \u201cI plan things better. I\u2019m more patient. I still sleep badly, and my weight and health need some work, but that\u2019s combat damage. There\u2019s got to be a way to fix those without being s to friends and strangers who are struggling with chaos. I\u2019ll try.\u201d McNamara was a crime writer and ran the website TrueCrimeDiary, where she discussed both breaking news and cold cases. Before her death, she was trying to track down a murderer who committed 50 rapes and killed 12 people in California between 1976 and 1986 before disappearing. She dubbed him \u201cthe Golden State Killer.\u201d \u201cShe had a mind for the details of true crime the way other people have for baseball or me for films,\u201d Oswalt says in a sneak peek at the upcoming 48 Hours: The Golden State Killer special airing on Saturday. \u201cShe could recall the details of pretty much every late 20th and 21st century crime. It was just in her head.\u201d McNamara was traveling all over California to retrace the killer\u2019s steps and was exhausted from the search. On April 20, 2016, Oswalt told her to sleep in the next day. She never woke up. An undiagnosed heart condition combined with the medications Adderall, Xanax, and the pain medication Fentanyl proved lethal. She was 46.

About his place in art history as a pioneer of Pop Art painting, there was no discussion. What he did address was the future of art itself. He was worried about what would become of museums and art foundations \u2014 not because the public lacked interest in what they offered, but rather because the quality of those offerings, owing to federal legislation, was rapidly eroding.\nWhen Jim died in March , I thought back to our conversations and began to look at the legislation he had mentioned, and that, in turn, led me to an unexpected place: Richard Nixon \u2019s 1969 tax return.\nThat return had two problems. First, it deducted the value of a gift \u2014 the donation of Nixon\u2019s vice-presidential papers to the National Archives \u2014 that was not actually made until 1970. Second, the value placed on that gift by Nixon was considered by many, most notably members of Congress, to be substantially inflated.\nAs to the first, Edward Morgan, the Nixon aide who signed the deed of gift on Nixon\u2019s behalf, was indicted and sentenced to prison .\nContinue reading the main story As to the second, Nixon was not alone: Concerns had been raised regarding the value of similar deductions taken by Lyndon Johnson and Hubert Humphrey. So Congress revised the tax code: Before 1970, writers, artists and composers could deduct the fair market value of the works they gave; after the revision, creators of donated works were limited to the costs of the materials that went into the work. Thus, the owner of a painting could donate it to a museum and deduct the painting\u2019s full market value; but if that same work had been donated by the artist, the deduction would be limited to the costs of the paints and canvas.\nSign Up for the Opinion Today Newsletter Every weekday, get thought-provoking commentary from Op-Ed columnists, the Times editorial board and contributing writers from around the world.\n The impact of the legislation was immediate \u2014 and catastrophic. Gifts by artists, writers and musicians to charitable institutions fell radically, and have never recovered.\nThe Museum of Modern Art, in the three years before the revision, received 321 gifts from artists; in the three years after the change, only 28 works were donated. The Library of Congress reported that contributions of manuscripts to the library fell from approximately 230 musical manuscripts and over 100,000 literary manuscripts annually to zero in 1971 and 1972. James Billington, the librarian of Congress emeritus, described the tax revision as the \u201csingle major impediment to developing the library\u2019s graphic art holdings.\u201d A study of the tax revision published in The Yale Law Journal concluded that the \u201cvirtual cessation of charitable giving by creators has become a fact of life for museums and university libraries nationwide.\u201d\n With recent escalations in art prices and cutbacks in public funding of cultural institutions, few museums can afford the market prices for major works of art and important manuscripts. Consequently, many are now sold to private collectors \u2014 and since many of these collectors now live outside the United States, it\u2019s unlikely that the works will ever end up in an American museum or archive.\nLegislation to restore the market value deduction to artists, writers and composers was just introduced in Congress, as similar bills have been proposed over the last decade. Jim Rosenquist had testified in support of those efforts. The current draft legislation incorporates protections to prevent the sorts of abuses that gave rise to the revision of the tax code, but the climate in Washington will make passage difficult.\nLegislation, however, may no longer be necessary, and that hope comes from an unlikely source \u2014 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, the 2010 Supreme Court decision equating corporations with individuals for purposes of the First Amendment. Citizens United made explicit a current of constitutional law that focused on government restraints based on the identity of the speaker, rather than the subject matter of the speech.\nThe application of Citizens United is straightforward: Donations are a protected form of \u201csymbolic speech\u201d (such as gifts of money, and flag-burning), and the withdrawal of the fair market tax deduction from the creators of those works is \u2014 under the precedent of Citizens United \u2014 a prohibited form of speaker discrimination. The government would have to demonstrate a \u201ccompelling state interest\u201d for removing the deduction \u2014 nearly impossible when attempting to justify the denial of the fair market value deduction to those who donate their own work to cultural institutions. All that needs to happen is for an artist who has donated work in this way to object to the I.R.S. over the denial of a fair market deduction; then the case would go to federal court. Easy, doable and should be done.\nReturning the market value deduction to artists, writers and composers would encourage them to donate culturally and historically significant works to American museums.

In November, an appeals court ordered a new trial, citing racial discrimination by prosecutors during jury selection.\nDefense lawyers had also argued the medical evidence cleared Crawford: the little boy had pneumonia and died of sepsis, they said.\nThe DA's office, which is no longer headed by Cox, said in a statement this week that given the medical evidence, it could not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a homicide had occurred.\n\"Without any evidence of intentional acts by Crawford that directly caused the death, the State faced competing possibilities of neglect by Crawford and potentially other family members in the care and treatment of the child,\" the DA's office said in a statement.\nRelated: What's Next for the Arkansas Executions\nOne of Crawford's lawyers, Cecelia Kappel, said the DA's decision was a relief for her client, who has been forced to stay in his hometown of Shreveport while free on bond but can now leave the state.\n\"It's really been an incredibly tough road for him,\" she said. \"He wasn't in the greatest situation in life as a poor black man in Shreveport who had a bit of a criminal record. And he spent almost five years on death row, in a small cell with no windows.\n\"It's been rough putting his life back together,\" she said. \"He told me, 'I can't live in Shreveport any more. I'm in danger there...I'm a target.'\"\nShe said he plans to move to Dallas, where his young daughter lives.\nRelated: Wrongfully Convicted Man Gets Just $175,000 for 13 Years in Prison\nCox, who decided not to run for re-election as DA amid a firestorm over his views on law and order, could not be reached for comment about his successor's decision to permanently drop the case.\nDuring the trial, he suggested to jurors that Jesus Christ would want them to sentence Crawford to death; after the conviction, he told the probation office that Crawford deserved \"as much human suffering as physically possible\" before death.\nAccording to the Death Penalty Information Center, Caddo Parish was responsible for three-fourths of the prisoners sent to death row in Louisiana in the last five years.

Hop on Grindr or Scruff or any other web app designed to connect men looking for love \u2015 or just someone to get off with \u2015 and it won\u2019t be long before you\u2019re asked to show exactly what you\u2019re packing. \nFor some, sharing explicit images isn\u2019t a big deal. But for those who are worried about privacy and want to avoid having their nether bits distributed to anyone \u2015 or everyone \u2015 on the internet, dick pics have been seen as a total no-go. \nGyorgy Szucs, the 28-year-old gay CEO and founder of design and code company Creative Robot, wants to help eradicate dick pic stigma while promoting sex and body positivity and what he refers to as \u201ckinkiness.\u201d He\u2019s developed a new app, called Dick Code , that lets users choose from a number of illustrations that most closely match their genitals and then generates a \u201ccode\u201d that they can send to whomever they choose without fearing that move might eventually come back to haunt them. Via Dick Code Dick Code users are asked to select the penis that most closely matches their own. \nDick Code asks each user to select from a variety of physical penis characteristics \u2015 from size and girth to hairiness and curvature \u2015 in order to create an intimate profile of their member that is as representative as possible. Dick Codes also offers additional information that a dick pic can\u2019t, like the trajectory and pattern of the individual\u2019s ejaculate. \n\u201cI started by drawing many dicks as a practice,\u201d Szucs told me in an email. \u201cFirst I started with the obvious categories, like size and circumference and then I went on to the \u2018dirty\u2019 stuff and added everything that my mind could think of absolutely shamelessly.\u201d \nSzucs, who is originally from Hungary but currently resides in Santiago, Chile, also shared with me where the inspiration for Dick Code originally came from, his thoughts on the politics of dick pics (especially involving straight men sending unwanted images to women), his upcoming plans for Vagina Code and Sex Code apps and more. \nThe Huffington Post: Where did the idea for Dick Code come from? Was there a specific \u201ca ha!\u201d moment of inspiration? Gyorgy Szucs: I received a picture from a friend with drawn penises where you could choose the right one for you. I felt it was incomplete and too complicated to communicate the result. I immediately thought it could be a great web app, especially if I put my kinkiness in it as well. via Dick Code Dick Code asks users to choose the trajectory of ejaculate that most closely matches their own. \nDo you intend for people to really use it when communicating with others online? Or is it more of an art or conversation piece? I wanted a simple, handy tool that enables people to communicate more about their sexual features. I focused on the parts we tend to be shy about, so I intentionally didn\u2019t give descriptions. I\u2019m a very rational person, so I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s an art piece \u2015 I just want to help people and bring out their kink. \nDick pics are controversial and can be problematic because they are often sent to people who don\u2019t want them \u2015 especially by straight men to straight women . What are your personal thoughts about the politics of dick pics? It depends. I believe if you receive a dick pic you didn\u2019t ask for, most likely that means the owner of it has an ugly face and/or personality. But if you\u2019re already in a conversation with someone online looking for a hookup, and passed the mental check, I see no problem in exchanging hot pics. Now you can exchange dick codes too. via Dick Code Dick Code asks users to choose the amount of pubic and testicle hair that most closely matches their own. \nDo you think that dick pics work differently among gay men versus non-gay people? How do you think women feel about this and do you think straight men would use Dick Code? Let me tell you \u2015 [by looking at Google analytics I learned that] 40 percent of the 1 million visitors I had in four days were women. I thought it would be a gay thing only, but I think now I\u2019ll have to interview straight women too to see what\u2019s going on. Based on the feedback so far, I believe that girls use it to describe their favorite dick. Straight guys don\u2019t really use it, in fact they are mostly disgusted by this, but maybe they will soon be asked by their next date to share their dick code. No escape. \nWhat has the response been? What are people saying? I\u2019m having such fun days. I\u2019m receiving like 50 messages a day about how ingenious the idea is, how easy it became for shy people to be more kinky. They are laughing a lot while still sharing features they never talked about before. And the most amazing part is that people who created and shared their dick code tell me how surprisingly positive the responses are. They believed that their dick was not impressive as it is not \u201cbig,\u201d but they had now come to the realization that people (women especially) are kinky deep inside and find certain aspects of a dick impressive, other than just the size. \nAnd of course, girls keep asking for the V[agina] Code. I\u2019m already working on that, I just need lots of help as I\u2019m not experienced in that area. Gygorgy Szucs Gyorgy Szucs, the 28-year-old gay CEO and founder of design and code company Creative Robot, who invited Dick Code \nAre there other \u201ccodes\u201d in the works and when will they roll out? Vagina Code and Sex Code. The latter will be basically about sex positions and games. Kinky games. I believe the V Code will come in the following few weeks, and the Sex Code after that. I\u2019ll update the Dick Code page with details. \nI\u2019m absolutely shocked by the fact how many women use the Dick Code. I think the V code will be fun for straight guys mostly, but I guess the Sex Code will turn into the next \u201c50 Shades of Grey.\u201d \nWhat do you ultimately want people to take away from this project? I believe it is a fun tool to bring out your kinkiness in a very safe way and share it with your partner. It\u2019s easy to tap innocent drawn images about dirty stuff. It is definitely not just a gay thing. People tell me and now I believe that I started something big, something that might reform online dating and the way we talk about sex. I\u2019ll keep adding ways to it. I hope that dating sites will realize the value and maybe add a field in people\u2019s profile for D, V and Sex Codes. \nYou can visit Dick Code here .

By Nick Visser The New England Patriots visited the White House on Wednesday to celebrate their Super Bowl win alongside President Donald Trump, an annual tradition for the winner of the NFL championship. Well, half of the Patriots did, anyway. Thirty-four Patriots players, plus several staff members and coach Bill Belichick, attended the ceremony on the White House lawn as Trump praised what he called \u201cthe greatest Super Bowl comeback of all time.\u201d The team\u2019s full roster includes 68 players , which means half of the squad skipped the celebration. Super Bowl champion players often miss the annual White House victory visit due to scheduling conflicts. But turnout for Wednesday\u2019s event appeared to be lower than for a previous Patriots visit in 2015. To some players, absences were notably linked to politics. The New York Times first pointed out the stark difference between photographs of the event this year, and those from 2015, the last time the Patriots won the Super Bowl. The earlier photo shows about 120 people, including players and staff, standing behind former President Barack Obama. On Wednesday, there were barely more than 50 people alongside Trump. Patriots' turnout for President Obama in 2015 vs. Patriots' turnout for President Trump today: https://t.co/OxMEOqZonI pic.twitter.com/pLmJWhOw1j \u2014 NYT Sports (@NYTSports) April 19, 2017 The Patriots strongly refuted a Times tweet showing the 2015 and 2017 photographs, saying the comparisons \u201clack context.\u201d The 2015 photo included more than 40 support staff members, who were seated on the lawn this year, the team said. These photos lack context. Facts: In 2015, over 40 football staff were on the stairs. In 2017, they were seated on the South Lawn. https://t.co/iIYtV0hR6Y \u2014 New England Patriots (@Patriots) April 20, 2017 \u201dOnly during the Trump presidency does the media care ... this much about who doesn\u2019t attend,\u201d Patriots spokesman Stacey James told HuffPost. \nOn Thursday, New York Times\u2019 sports editor Jason Stallman apologized for the paper\u2019s tweet, which he called \u201cterrible.\u201d \n\u201cI wish I could say it\u2019s complicated, but no, this one is pretty straightforward: I\u2019m an idiot,\u201d Stallman said in an email to The Washington Post . \u201cIt was my idea, it was my execution, it was my blunder. I made a decision in about four minutes that clearly warranted much more time. \n\u201cOnce we learned more, we tried to fix everything as much as possible as swiftly as possible and as transparently as possible. Of course, at that point the damage was done. I just needed to own it.\u201d Wednesday was the fifth time the team has gone to the White House, James said, and the number of players attending has ranged from about 27 to 50. \u201cHere\u2019s what gripes me \u2015 the scrutiny with which the visit to the White House has been handled by the press,\u201d James said. \u201cNever before have we had players being asked, \u2018Are you going to the White House?\u2019 ... There were only a few players who came out who said they don\u2019t support the president and weren\u2019t going for that reason.\u201d Notably absent Wednesday was Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who canceled at the last minute, citing \u201c personal family matters ,\u201d according to a statement obtained by ESPN. Brady also missed the festivities in 2015, but attended the three previous visits. Trump didn\u2019t mention Brady, but he did call out several players by name, including an awkward moment involving wide receiver Danny Amendola, The Boston Globe reported. Amendola was among those who missed the event. \u201cWhere\u2019s Danny? Where\u2019s Danny?\u201d Trump said. Amendola later thanked the president for the \u201cshout out\u201d in a since-deleted tweet, and said he was attending a funeral. Six other Patriots had announced they wouldn\u2019t attend the event for political reasons. The Globe reported this week that Alan Branch would skip the ceremony because of Trump\u2019s sexist remarks , and \u201cwouldn\u2019t want to spend time away from my family to shake the hand of a guy I wouldn\u2019t want to meet with or talk to.\u201d Defensive back Devin McCourty told Time in February he would stay away, explaining the \u201cbasic reason for me is I don\u2019t feel accepted in the White House.\u201d Trump has personal ties to the Patriots, as various media outlets have reported. Brady had a Make America Great Again hat in his locker for much of the 2016 season, and Trump\u2019s campaign garnered the support of both Belichick and team owner Robert Kraft . Trump responded to the controversy on Thursday with a jab at the Times. Failing @nytimes , which has been calling me wrong for two years, just got caught in a big lie concerning New England Patriots visit to W.H. \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 20, 2017 Kraft in February complained about media attention to players\u2019 decisions to skip this year\u2019s celebration, saying it was the first time people cared. \u201cEvery time we\u2019ve had the privilege of going to the White House, a dozen of our players don\u2019t go,\u201d Kraft told the \u201cToday\u201d show. \u201cThis is the first time it\u2019s gotten any media attention. You know, some of the players have the privilege of going in college because they\u2019re on national championship teams, others have family commitments. But this is America. We\u2019re all free to do whatever\u2019s best for us. We\u2019re just privileged to be in a position to be going.\u201d Matt Ferner contributed reporting.

The researchers found that instances of sexual violence and harassment were so pervasive that 1 in 6 of the teen girls surveyed said they had been harassed since Election Day . \nThe report, titled \u201c Let Her Learn: Stopping School Pushout ,\u201d was conducted in partnership with Lake Research Partners to pinpoint the reasons why girls drop out of school. Researchers surveyed 1,003 teen girls between the ages of 14 to 18 from across the United States this past January. \nAccording to the report, 1 in 5 girls between 14 and 18 years old (21 percent) reported being sexually assaulted \u2015 defined by NWLC as \u201cthey had been kissed or touched without their consent.\u201d \nGirls of color and LGBTQ girls experience sexual assault and harassment at higher than average rates. \nTwenty-four percent of Latina girls reported experiencing unwanted kissing or touching. Twenty-three percent of Native American girls, and 22 percent of black girls reported experiencing sexual assault. LGBTQ girls experienced the highest incidences of sexual assault, with 38 percent reporting they had been kissed or touched without their consent. \nThe researchers found that 6 percent of all girls surveyed said they had been raped. But, again, those numbers were higher for LGBTQ girls and girls of color: 15 percent of LGBTQ girls, 11 percent of Native American girls, 9 percent of black girls, and 7 percent of Latina girls reported being forced to have sex when they did not want to. National Womens Law Center Thirty percent of teenage girls experience their \"first rape\" at 17 years old. \nThese statistics take on new weight given that the president of the United States is an accused sexual predator . \nAccording to the survey, more than 1 in 6 teenage girls (or 17 percent) reported that they had experienced harassment since the 2016 presidential election. \nMany advocates worried that there would be an uptick in violence against women when President Donald Trump took office. Directly after the election, many incidences of sexism and harassment happened, along with an increase in hate crimes . \nPresident Trump has been accused of sexually assaulting more than a dozen women , and has publicly defended other men who have been accused of sexual harassment and assault, like Roger Ailes and the recently-ousted Bill O\u2019Reilly . \n\u201cMy concern is based on not just what [President Trump\u2019s] behavior has been, because he is an individual, but what he can do to influence other men\u2019s behaviors and other women\u2019s perceptions of their value,\u201d Rita Smith, the former executive director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, told The Huffington Post in November . \u201cEven just the election itself had an impact on how men treated and talked about women.\u201d \nNeena Chaudhry, NWLC Director of Education, explained in a press release that this data should \u201csound an urgent alarm\u201d for politicians and educators across the country. \n\u201cThe trauma that girls experience affects not only their mental and physical health but also their ability to concentrate, feel safe, and stay and do well in school,\u201d Chaudhry wrote. \u201cWe need targeted policies to help these groups of girls stay and thrive in school, and we owe them no less.\u201d \nHead over to the National Women\u2019s Law Center to read the full report, which also explores other obstacles young girls face including homelessness, unplanned pregnancy and racism. \nCORRECTION : This entry has been updated to clarify that 1 in 6 teen girls reported being harassed, which includes both sexual harassment and non-sexual harassment, since Election Day.

The plastic trash is brought in from distant regions by currents in the Atlantic Ocean, creating a sort of \u201cplastic conveyor belt,\u201d as the researchers put it, which ends up in the Arctic. \nResearchers from University of C\u00e1diz in Spain and other institutions around the world sampled pieces of plastic floating in the Arctic on an expedition in 2013, reports The Washington Post. The researchers estimate that there are around 300 billion tiny pieces of plastic on the Arctic\u2019s surface \u2015 with likely even more on the seafloor below. \nNotably, the scientists think that this plastic largely comes from waste dumped in the ocean by North Americans and Europeans. \n\u201cThis plastic is coming from us in the North Atlantic ,\u201d lead author Andr \u00e9s C\u00f3zar Caba\u00f1 as told The New York Times. \u201cAnd the more we know about what happens in the Arctic, the better chance we have\u201d of solving the problem. Marcelo Horn via Getty Images The Arctic Ocean is accumulating a high concentration of plastic, broken down over time into smaller bits called microplastics -- such as those pictured here. \nAround 8 million tons of plastic end up in the ocean each year , according to a 2016 report from the World Economic Forum. That\u2019s the equivalent of tossing the contents of a garbage truck into the ocean every minute. At this rate, oceans will contain more plastics than fish in weight by 2050. \nOne consequence of ocean pollution is that marine animals can mistake trash for food and ingest it or get tangled in it, causing injury or death, according to   Administration. \nThe researchers who studied the plastic debris accumulating in the Arctic said the problem will likely only get worse. \n\u201cIt\u2019s only been about 60 years since we started using plastic industrially, and the usage and the production has been increasing ever since,\u201d study co-author Carlos Duarte told the Post . \u201cSo, most of the plastic that we have disposed in the ocean is still now in transit to the Arctic.\u201d ALSO ON HUFFPOST Ocean Plastics And The Animals They Hurt Ocean Plastics And The Animals They Hurt 1", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "andr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carlos duarte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marcelo horn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sarah ruiz-grossman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "washington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "world economic forum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arctic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of c\u00e1diz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national oceanic and atmospheric administration", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "arctic ocean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huffpost ocean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlantic ocean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "getty images the arctic ocean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north atlantic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arctic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greenland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-20T21:07:48.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "5bcb3d54b8255bccd3f34900cdeb05bac93f8070", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOjBiVIuBT1SzRG.KdctXV4td6DSNXKsTWetS4oV9MqMb9ku.yqdS4mntJUnv0wNFGaeaPmxx9.Qx.RUl3ZyyQPKLR8skkgCR5.PHYu9zp8ccIa4a0ZIqq2jD99NsHk9XZoyXR1NDyiKlH4flhgGloZOs.1_CgYMrA0-", "site_full": "www.huffingtonpost.com", "site": "huffingtonpost.com", "site_section": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/feeds/verticals/women/index.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Women - The Huffington Post", "title": "This Mom Is Raising Money To Open An Accessible Salon For Kids With Disabilities", "title_full": "This Mom Is Raising Money To Open An Accessible Salon For Kids With Disabilities", "published": "2017-04-20T18:29:52.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/2000_1000/58f7d0192600003596c4694d.jpeg?cache=cddlqf9wn3", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 139, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 921, "comments": 0, "shares": 921}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "5bcb3d54b8255bccd3f34900cdeb05bac93f8070", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kBMzlsF_JTjQdlO8_P5DHS7vvZzrbDOjBiVIuBT1SzRG.KdctXV4td6DSNXKsTWetS4oV9MqMb9ku.yqdS4mntJUnv0wNFGaeaPmxx9.Qx.RUl3ZyyQPKLR8skkgCR5.PHYu9zp8ccIa4a0ZIqq2jD99NsHk9XZoyXR1NDyiKlH4flhgGloZOs.1_CgYMrA0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Emily McCombs", "published": "2017-04-20T18:29:52.000+03:00", "title": "This Mom Is Raising Money To Open An Accessible Salon For Kids With Disabilities", "text": "04/20/2017 11:02 am ET | Updated 23 hours ago This Mom Is Raising Money To Open An Accessible Salon For Kids With Disabilities Getting a haircut shouldn't be a challenge. Cat Miller Rongitsch says meeting her step-daughter Maddy opened her eyes to accessibility issues. 1.2k \nGetting a haircut can be a challenging experience for any child, but especially for a child with disabilities. That\u2019s why a Minnesota mom and hair stylist is trying to open an accessible salon specifically for kids with cognitive and physical differences in St. Paul. \n\u201cAs a beauty professional with daughters that have challenges, I know that there are aspects of a salon that can create obstacles for some individuals to have a positive experience. Will the building be accessible? Will there be loud music? Chemical smells? What if I need a break? How will the staff react to my differences? Getting a bad haircut can be low on the list of concerns,\u201dCat Miller Rongitsch wrote on the GoFundMe page she posted to raise money for the salon. \nRongitsch has a 9-year-old step-daughter named Maddy, who is paraplegic from spina bifida and uses a wheelchair, and a second daughter, 3-year-old Betty, who has cognitive disabilities. At the last salon she worked at, the front door wasn\u2019t accessible and Maddy had to use a side entrance. Catherine Miller Rongitsch At the last salon Rongitsch worked at, the front door wasn\u2019t accessible for her daughter Maddy. \nOver the years, the stylist has also made home visits to do haircuts for kids with autism who have difficulty in a salon environment. \n\u201cThere\u2019s so much anxiety and fear for the whole family going to the salon. It\u2019s a big deal, so having me come in helps alleviate some of that. There should be a place for that,\u201d she told The Huffington Post. \nRongitsch\u2019s salon will have accessible entrances and wide aisles, a quiet atmosphere aided by silent blow dryers and textured flooring for people with visual impairment. The salon will also offer weighted blankets and fidget toys. She hopes to create a \u201csafe space\u201d for all people with disabilities to get \u201cservices with dignity.\u201d \nRecalling a photo that went viral in 2015 of a barber lying on the floor to cut the hair of a boy with autism , she says: \u201cIt was good to see that, but at the same time it made me sad that this family was so overwhelmed by the care that this stylist took with their little boy that it went viral. It should be the standard and it\u2019s a standard I want to create.\u201d \nSo far, the reception has been good. Rongitsch says she has been overwhelmed with responses from families who can\u2019t wait to visit the salon when it is opened. As of Thursday morning, she had raised $3,895 of her $25,000 goal. \n\u201cThere are so many people reaching out to me and saying \u2018Thank you\u2019 and that they\u2019re so glad there will finally be a place for their family to go.

She crossed the street and climbed into the driver\u2019s seat of her shiny, black 12-passenger Sprinter van. Juggling two phones, she turned the key. The engine chugged awake, and she started tapping out texts to her riders. A few minutes shy of 6am on a summer Sunday, Kristal was already late. \n\nAbout six years ago, when Kristal was 22, she and her mother, Crystal Speaks, decided to try their hands at turning circumstance into opportunity. Crystal was going broke from the expense of the visits to see her son, Jarvae. He was serving a 10-year sentence in Huntingdon state prison, 200 miles from Philadelphia. Opportunity came in the form of thousands of Philadelphia families like theirs who have someone locked up far from home.\nIn the years Jarvae was at Huntingdon, Crystal got to know some of the other regulars well enough to start giving them rides. She\u2019d pick them up from their homes twice a month in her white Nissan Armada. They\u2019d pay her $50 for her gas and her trouble. It was just $5 or $10 more than the bus a local not-for-profit group offered, but they had to meet the bus in downtown Philly before daybreak. What Crystal didn\u2019t spend on the trip she\u2019d put on Jarvae\u2019s commissary account, easing the prison\u2019s bite into the paycheck she brought working long hours as a nurse\u2019s aide. \nOne day in the visiting room, Jarvae looked around at the women his mom had driven there that day. \u201cJarvae said, \u2018Man, there\u2019s a lot of people coming up here, you should turn this into a van service,\u2019\u201d Crystal remembered. Jarvae called his sister Kristal and leaned on her to help make it happen. On that bumpy road of carceral enterprise, Bridging the Gap LLC rolled to life.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kristal chews on sunflower seeds to keep her alert. On top of running the van company, she has a full-time job as a social worker.

Many of those facilities sit in rural counties deep into central Pennsylvania , where incarceration is among the most robust and lasting employers. But most of the prisoners come from Pennsylvania\u2019s cities \u2013 above all, Philadelphia.\nThe state doesn\u2019t keep numbers on prisoners\u2019 hometowns, but it does track whwhich courts send them. About 28% of Pennsylvania state prisoners were sentenced in Philly, according to an analysis of the state data by Columbia University\u2019s Brown Institute for Media Innovation. Of them, about half are in a prison more than three hours\u2019 drive from Philadelphia. \nA prison is a prison is a prison, some might say. But to the loved ones trying to maintain ties, miles make a difference. To get to prison, one must also have disposable income. To get inside, one cannot have spent time behind bars. In the neighborhoods Kristal\u2019s vans sweep through to pick up customers, the twin punches of poverty and mass incarceration have winnowed the visiting population. Those left, Kristal\u2019s customers, are nearly all working women.\nThere is an impression that those in prison live on the taxpayer\u2019s dollar. To some extent, it\u2019s true: Pennsylvania spends more than $2bn each year on corrections; nearly $300m goes to prisoners\u2019 education, training and healthcare. But more than $1bn of those dollars go to paying off the debt on buildings, and to the salaries and retirement benefits of employees, many of them in rural counties where the state opened prisons to blunt the pain of factories shuttered. \nThe women who ride for hours to visit loved ones in prison \u2013 in pictures Read more \nAs the national cost of locking people up ballooned to over $80bn a year , Pennsylvania joined systems across the country in snipping expenses where they could. Cuts came to food, laundry and healthcare. Prisons closed . Commissary prices rose.\n\nThere is, said sociologist Megan Comfort, at least a tacit acknowledgement by correctional institutions that when they cut back, families will cover the difference. Even a woman struggling to make ends meet on minimum wage can more quickly afford the $3.09 for a six-pack of boxer shorts than can a prisoner earning 50 cents an hour in a facility kitchen.\n\u201cWomen on the outside are really making prisons run,\u201d said Comfort, senior research sociologist at the non-profit Research Triangle Institute International, who studies prisons\u2019 impact on families. \u201cTheir labor and their economic power has been folded into the way the institutions are working.\u201d That holds back many of the women working hardest to rise. \u201cAll their money starts to go into the criminal justice system to support the men in their lives,\u201d Comfort added.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Day broke just before Kristal stopped to pick up two women from a brick duplex. Ms Rachel rocked from side to side toward the van, moving uncomfortably with her cane. Her body\u2019s visible aches fell short of the deeper ones that had, since the sentencing of her grandson Jeff, dragged on her soul. Jeff\u2019s girlfriend, Lois, 28, held their 18-month-old daughter Jade on her hip.\nLois\u2019s son, Cameren, had meant to come too, before his fire fizzled with the early morning alarm. Though not blood-related, Cameren considered Jeff a father. The four-hour trip each way felt like a lifetime to a seven-year-old boy, and that morning, when Lois woke him, Cameren shook his head and turned back to bed.\nThere are moments when Lois wanted to climb in beside Cameren, to cancel on Kristal, to avoid the reality of Jeff\u2019s 20-to-40-year sentence. Kristal lets kids as young as Jade ride for free. Even so, Lois thought about what else she could do with the $50 she pays Kristal for her seat. \u201cIt\u2019s just like, do I put this toward this bill or do I take Jade up there?\u201d she\u2019d ask herself each time she got her paycheck from the non-profit she worked for downtown.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Kristal with her father at Greene state prison in 1996. Because her father was incarcerated more than five hours from Philadelphia, Kristal only visited him a handful of times as a child. They have rebuilt a relationship in recent years, and he\u2019s recently been approved for release. Photograph: Photo courtesy of Kristal Bush \nGoing with Ms Rachel eased some of the burden. Jade\u2019s great-grandmother helped when the baby fussed on the ride. She paid for the visiting room food. Between them, Jeff and Jade could eat six packets of microwaved chicken wings. That cost her $24. The sodas were $2 each. Chips were $1, then they\u2019d both ask for candy. Lois ticked off that menu when Jeff called her asking when she\u2019d come next. \u201cI try to explain to him that coming up there to visit you, that\u2019s a $100 trip,\u201d she said.\nLois had goals. Upgrade her associate\u2019s degree to a bachelor\u2019s. Put in the required hours for her Habitat for Humanity house, where the monthly mortgage would buy a permanence that rent didn\u2019t. Ms Rachel knew Lois, not even 30 yet, also dreamed of a man beside her life. But she promised both herself and Jeff that would never get in the way of Jade knowing her father. \n\u201cShe\u2019s a good girl,\u201d Ms Rachel would say before voicing her doubt that Lois would stick out Jeff\u2019s whole sentence. Given the growing number of amber pill bottles clustered on her bedside table, Ms Rachel didn\u2019t know if she could either. The thought that Jeff might do those decades alone weighed on her weak heart.\nKristal held Ms Rachel\u2019s elbow as she hoisted herself into the vehicle. Three generations of women arranged themselves in the van\u2019s seats. Kristal slid the door shut; she had five more stops to go.\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Kristal was terrible with names, but she remembered each rider\u2019s story. In most, she heard echoes of her own. \nWhen she was three, Kristal\u2019s father was sent to a prison five hours from Philly. She saw him only a handful of times before she turned 18. Jarvae was in and out of lockups starting when he was a teenager. Her older brother, Gerald, also did time. She had cousins serving life. \u201cEven when I was younger with my best friend it was like, \u2018Hey girl, your dad locked up? Oh mine\u2019s, too!\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cIt was just so normal to me.\u201d \nBut driving people to prison wasn\u2019t the career Kristal envisioned for herself. If her brother Jarvae used his ambition to earn \u201cfast money\u201d in the streets, Kristal put hers toward distancing herself from them. At the charter high school she went to, teachers insisted everyone apply to college. She forged her mother\u2019s signature on the paperwork and made her way to Temple University. After she graduated, she used savings scrimped from her student loans for a down payment on a house. It was close enough to the hood to still be affordable, and far enough to feel like she was making it. \nA full-time job as a social worker covered both her mortgage and the first Bridging the Gap van that she bought for her mother down at the local auction. That\u2019s where Kristal thought her role in the business would end. \u201cI didn\u2019t want nothing to do with prisons,\u201d she said. But she was pragmatic. When her mother began to lose interest in driving, tiring from long stretches on the road, Kristal took over so that money she spent on the van didn\u2019t go to waste. \nShe took it on with the rigor of any good millennial entrepreneur. She posted pictures and videos on Instagram and Snapchat; then came an app for easy scheduling and a deal for half off your fifth ride. Incarcerated friends and relatives passed the word around the prison yard, drawing in more riders. She bought a second van, then a third. Crystal started driving again, this time as her daughter\u2019s employee, making runs to prison in between night shifts as a cleaner at a cancer clinic. \n\nThe company grew, but Kristal had loftier goals. \u201cWhatever I do, I always gotta find a purpose behind it,\u201d she said. She put that purpose on T-shirts, bags and the side of her vans, in script: \u201cBridging the Gap: bridging the gap between inmates and their loved ones.\u201d \n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 The sun was already hot when Kristal pulled into the gas station on the edge of the city to meet Crystal, who was driving a second van to the prisons in Huntington County that day. \nRiders got out to stretch their legs. Erica sauntered over to join the other ride-or-die regulars. Her bob was fresh and a flowered dress wrapped her curves. Next to her, Tysheen, Aisha and Tanesha stood in a circle, their long khimars rippling in the hot air. \u201cMy sisters looking good today,\u201d said Erica, a pastor\u2019s daughter taking in the elegance of her three Muslim friends. They smiled. The four women had become close riding the van, cliquing up, introducing their kids, sometimes staying over at one another\u2019s houses on the night before a ride to give opinions on makeup and outfits. \nAisha leaned in to look at the shoebox in Erica\u2019s arms. \u201cAll Stars,\u201d Erica said. Every week, Erica tried to wear something new for her fiance, Maurice, keeping her outfits as fresh as the bright white shoes in the box. Each woman had her tricks to compensate for all the intimacies denied.\nOn the road, prison rides settled into a rhythm. Early miles were for small talk; the hours through the rolling green mountains, for sleep. A half-hour from the prison, the women began to stir. Anxiety and excitement buzzed underneath the R&B streaming over the speakers. On a busy Sunday, late arrivals might be relegated to sitting outside in the heat if the visiting room was too full. Or worse, they might be turned away. \nLois pulled out her comb and began to twist sections of Jade\u2019s hair, clipping a barrette to each end. Tysheen spritzed herself with scent. Erica flipped her camera to selfie mode and fluffed her hair. Aisha pulled out a compact and swept gloss over her full lips. She pulled out towelettes, then passed them around so everyone could clean their palms and under their fingernails. Pennsylvania prisons swab the hands of all visitors for drugs. Even touching dirty money can get a visit denied. \n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aisha, Tysheen and Tanesha run toward the doors of Smithfield prison, not wanting to waste a moment of their visiting day. The vans usually arrive between 9am and 10am, and come back to pick riders up between 3pm and 3.30pm. Photograph: Zara Katz and Lisa Riordan Seville \n\u201cMake sure y\u2019all don\u2019t have no wire or nothing in your bra. They may be searching the vans to be prepared to have y\u2019all\u2019s stuff checked. If you all have anything, we can roll down the window, open the door and let whatever you all have out.\u201d Here Kristal would pause each week, hoping it wouldn\u2019t come to that. Then she\u2019d smile. \u201cOther than that, enjoy your visit!\u201d\nTanesha didn\u2019t even wait for Kristal to stop before pulling the van door open. She took off, black khimar billowing behind her, forgetting the bum leg that had recently kept her homebound. Tysheen, in gray, was just behind. It was 10.30 am. There was no time to waste.\nObjects to remind you of your loved one locked away in jail \u2013 in pictures Read more \nRiders sorted, Kristal pulled into her favorite spot in the parking lot to wait out the five-hour visit. She liked to look out over the green valley she found both peaceful and a little eerie. Crystal parked the second van beside her. She rolled down the window to tell Kristal how her riders had bolted out of the vans toward the prison doors. \n\u201cThey always running \u2013 Tanesha the main one, talking about, oh my leg hurts!\u201d said Kristal. She shook her head. \u201cI can\u2019t tell, not the way you running into that prison!\u201d\nMother and daughter cracked up. \u201cThey\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Kristal. \u201cI love them though.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Around the same time that Kristal took over the van service, she found out her brother Jarvae\u2019s son, Nyvae, who had lived with his mother outside the city, was on the verge of going into the foster care system.\nBarely out of college, Kristal became her nephew\u2019s official guardian. Prison took away her father, along with most of the other men in her life. Then it turned her from aunt to mother. She swore to herself it wouldn\u2019t make her a wife. But like her riders, Kristal found bonds hard to break. \nKristal had laid herself out to rest in the back seat when the phone rang. She answered the call from Khali.\nKristal met Khali through her hairdresser in the beginning of 2012. They hit it off, and moved in together fast. But after he was indicted on drug conspiracy charges in late 2013, their romance morphed into a deep friendship. Khali was facing a life sentence for dealing pain pills. Like Lois, Kristal imagined more of a life partnership than could fit in a prison visiting room. But he was still the person she talked about family with, and the one she consulted as she tried to figure out how to raise Nyvae into the man she wanted him to be. Khali\u2019s dad had been in prison when he was a kid. His grandmother was the one who insisted he make his bed and take out the garbage, chores he said Nyvae should do to balance out all the ways Kristal spoiled him. \nIn the tender bluntness of their prison-monitored conversations, Kristal found a relationship of equals. Khali was her confidant and her cheerleader. \u201cWhen they\u2019re in prison,\u201d Kristal said, \u201cthey see a different side of us because they see how strong we are.\u201d \n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The three hour-plus van ride that Kristal Bush makes from Philadelphia to Huntingdon and Smithfield state prisons \u2013 in the dark green band \u2013 is a distance many families must travel to see their loved ones. Photograph: Michael Krisch/Brown Institute for Media Innovation \nThere are, according to an analysis by the New York Times, about 36,000 black men \u201cmissing\u201d from Philadelphia , lost largely to early death or to prison. Only New York and Chicago, cities much larger than Philly, have more men gone. The women who ride Kristal\u2019s van, the majority of whom are black, have had at least one man go missing in the Philadelphia prison system. Most have seen violence take several more away. Compounded loss makes for brutal decisions, the kind that can break a woman\u2019s heart.\nAt 3pm, Kristal pulled out to retrieve her riders. On the road, women exchanged \u201cHow was your visits?\u201d The consensus, this week, was good. Some days Kristal sees tears, fuming, disappointment deep enough to bring visits to a skidding halt. Good visits made for better rides home. Women cracked their armor. \nDeep in a conversation about the importance of education with Ms Rachel, Erica hunted around in her phone until she found the photo of her nine-year-old daughter Faith\u2019s report card. She pinched the image big so the older women could see. \n\u201cWow, look at them A\u2019s!\u201d cooed Ms Rachel. \u201cPraise God.\u201d\nErica swiped again until she found photos of Faith\u2019s second-place win at the science fair and scholar of the week certificate. \n\u201cAnd you in north Philly?\u201d Ms Rachel asked, knowing what it meant to grow up in the city\u2019s most troubled quadrant. \u201cShe got a challenge and still beat the odds.\u201d\nNodding, Erica produced a video of Faith\u2019s violin concert, music lessons another amenity that had convinced Erica to bus her child the county over from Philly. \u201cWhen she started going there, the teacher said I see what part of the city you living in,\u201d Erica told Ms Rachel. \u201cShe said your daughter speak so well.\u201d\nErica had already taught Faith how to smooth and sterilize sentences so people would look past her address, her father\u2019s absence, the color of her skin. When Faith said, \u201cMom, I\u2019m either going to be a doctor or an RN, I\u2019m not aiming for nothing else,\u201d Erica told her, \u201cYou can do it.\u201d It\u2019s what she told herself on the mornings where she didn\u2019t know if she could do another 17-hour shift caring for her disabled clients, or on the nights she went home again to an empty bed.\nKnowing that all 6 feet 5 inches of Maurice would be waiting at the prison fence when she pulled up kept her riding. But doubling down on love exacted a price higher than the $400 a month Erica spent on visits, $200 twice a month for commissary, and phone calls that ran to $75 a week. She wanted to go back to school, but between work, raising Faith and the trips to Huntingdon, her ambition got pushed to the back of the line. \n\u201cYour life is on pause however long you decide to stay with this individual or until this individual comes home,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why some people do walk away.\u201d\n\u2022 \u2022 \u2022 Sixteen hours after she pulled away that morning, Kristal arrived home. At the end of some of these trips, Kristal thought about giving up on the company. Each time she got close, the phone would ring, and she\u2019d think: darn, I can\u2019t leave these people. She walked through her door, collapsed on the couch, and scrolled blankly through her social media feeds. Soon she\u2019d start sending texts to riders about the next day\u2019s trip. They expected her there. \nEight months later, one of Kristal\u2019s vans arrived to pick up Erica and Faith. Erica had recently gotten the news that Maurice, who is serving a four-to-eight-year sentence, had been denied parole. She had been telling Maurice that she was done waiting \u2013 another \u201chit\u201d from the parole board and she\u2019d walk. Instead, she decided to double down again. What she hadn\u2019t done was told Faith; Maurice wanted to do it as a family. \nErica reserved two seats on Kristal\u2019s van for 11 March. She and Faith woke before dawn to make that 200-mile drive to the visiting room at Huntingdon where Maurice waited for them, trying to figure out how to tell his daughter that daddy\u2019s not yet coming home.\nThis project was supported by the Economic Hardship Reporting Project \nTopics US prisons Philadelphia Pennsylvania Race issues features   Share   Reuse this content", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kristal bush", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "aisha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lisa riordan seville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tanesha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rachel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lois", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gerald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jarvae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyvae", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zara katz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cameren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maurice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "megan comfort", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huntingdon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lisa riordan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jade", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "erica", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pinterest kristal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tysheen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook twitter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kristal bush  going", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gap llc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nissan armada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia university\u2019s brown institute for media innovation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael krisch/brown institute for media innovation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "temple university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faith", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook twitter pinterest aisha", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "smithfield", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "research triangle institute international", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huntingdon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook twitter pinterest kristal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "instagram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook twitter pinterest", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philadelphia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cameren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huntington county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huntingdon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pennsylvania", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greene", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tysheen", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-20T14:36:34.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "820ce979290f98d60e062cc65ca7e05df40b9c05", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJKHuqNkbqk1FbTyFQSpR9J85S_MtxqVULfZOy9hnapE.eQ_8byAZB0_v3mwChQICIgB_riSudeybPcXYxOy_fJ.oI1m7fu4rR49ZzJAmhAr0-", "site_full": "www.yahoo.com", "site": "yahoo.com", "site_section": "https://www.yahoo.com/news/world/", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "World | Yahoo News - Latest News &amp; Headlines", "title": "Report: 500 ineligible voters cast ballots in North Carolina", "title_full": "Report: 500 ineligible voters cast ballots in North Carolina", "published": "2017-04-22T01:42:17.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/429oyE2czdontoTTp5T9_g--/aD0yNzcyO3c9NDQxNjtzbT0xO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en_us/News/ap_webfeeds/833e4f64326b479292cefb8f9dc571a8.jpg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 5, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 919, "comments": 0, "shares": 919}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "820ce979290f98d60e062cc65ca7e05df40b9c05", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQCR4GWh90giXQcOEADWgFJKHuqNkbqk1FbTyFQSpR9J85S_MtxqVULfZOy9hnapE.eQ_8byAZB0_v3mwChQICIgB_riSudeybPcXYxOy_fJ.oI1m7fu4rR49ZzJAmhAr0-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "JONATHAN DREW", "published": "2017-04-22T01:42:17.000+03:00", "title": "Report: 500 ineligible voters cast ballots in North Carolina", "text": "RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 North Carolina elections officials found that about 500 ineligible voters cast ballots in the 2016 general election \u2014 but not enough to change the outcome of any race, according to an audit released Friday. The State Board of Elections report said the 508 cases \u2014 the vast majority active felons \u2014 represented a small fraction of the 4.8 million ballots cast. The report didn't include any evidence of coordinated fraud, and many of the voters claimed to be confused about their eligibility.\nThe audit's findings contradict Republican claims that voter fraud runs rampant in North Carolina.\n\"That's 508 ineligible votes, so that's something that is never going to be acceptable,\" the board's executive director Kim Strach said in an interview. \"But the perspective is the number of people that we had vote in this election was unprecedented, and it's a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction.\"\nThe audit comes amid scrutiny of voting practices in North Carolina and around the country, with President Donald Trump recently claiming without evidence that scores of immigrants voted illegally nationwide. The North Carolina audit confirmed 41 votes by non-citizens.\nThe report said the board expects to refer all 441 cases of active felons voting to local prosecutors who will decide whether to pursue charges. Under North Carolina law, convicted felons must complete any probation or parole before they have the right to vote again.\nStatewide elections software will be updated this summer to improve electronic checks on felony status at the time of registration, and the report recommends better education for those who haven't finished all aspects of their sentences. The state is also revising voter registration forms to require applicants to check boxes verifying that they are citizens and not active felons.\nThe state didn't have comparable figures for ineligible voters in the 2012 election because the board didn't do the same kind of study that year, spokesman Pat Gannon said.\nThe cases were spread around the state. Guilford County, which surrounds Greensboro, had the most at 63. In the Raleigh area, Wake County had 36, while neighboring Durham County had 34.\nThe report cited 24 substantiated cases of people illegally voting multiple times in the election.\nTwo other violations involved people voting on behalf of relatives who died before Election Day. Both people, whose names were redacted, said they picked Republicans.\nOne told a Board of Elections investigator in an email that her 89-year-old mother gave the following instructions before she died: \"She said, 'OK and if anything happens you have my power of attorney and you be sure to vote for Donald Trump for me.'\"\nRepublican Senate leader Phil Berger responded to the report by saying that even a single fraudulent ballot \"is one too many, and that's why we continue to support commonsense policies like voter ID that improve voter confidence.\"\nBut Bob Hall, executive director of voting rights group Democracy North Carolina, said most cases in the report appear to be mistakes, not fraud. He noted a number of other states allow felons to vote while on probation.\n\"We don't want the report used to fan the hysteria about voter fraud or to justify irrational barriers to voting,\" he said.\nVoting practices in North Carolina were questioned by Republican activists during the close governor's race that was decided by just over 10,000 votes. Democrat Roy Cooper defeated Republican Pat McCrory's re-election bid in that contest. Hundreds of votes were challenged in postelection protests in 37 counties, but most of the challenges were dismissed or derailed by a lack of evidence.\n___\nFollow Drew at www.twitter.com/jonldrew", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "phil berger", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim strach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "roy cooper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pat gannon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bob hall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pat mccrory", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ap", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "state board of elections", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democracy north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "board of elections", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "republican", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "north carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north carolina raleigh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "n.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greensboro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guilford county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "raleigh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wake county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "durham county", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-22T01:42:17.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3634e2a23a6bbc95fa3064bf6ee82883d609c91a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxTqL_zg0lpoSCUviIN2GIHiEunvl1uu8k7IcH4tdfhCWJEJ0QiPoATN3VhLtXf7RIVt4j9ygk9OE-", "site_full": "www.nytimes.com", "site": "nytimes.com", "site_section": "http://www.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/SundayBookReview.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "NYT > Book Review", "title": "By the Book: John Waters: By the Book", "title_full": "By the Book: John Waters: By the Book", "published": "2017-04-20T12:44:42.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/23/books/review/0423-BKS-ByTheBook/0423-BKS-ByTheBook-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 98, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 917, "comments": 0, "shares": 917}, "gplus": {"shares": 3}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 18}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3634e2a23a6bbc95fa3064bf6ee82883d609c91a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPfVRrC83GDKJbKDRbkYjxTqL_zg0lpoSCUviIN2GIHiEunvl1uu8k7IcH4tdfhCWJEJ0QiPoATN3VhLtXf7RIVt4j9ygk9OE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-04-20T12:44:42.000+03:00", "title": "By the Book: John Waters: By the Book", "text": " Photo John Waters Credit Jillian Tamaki The film director and author of \u201cMake Trouble\u201d says that when a publisher asked him for a blurb for \u201cTransit,\u201d he sent back, \u201cRachel Cusk is too smart for her own good.\u201d\nWhat books are currently on your night stand?\n\u201c American Rust ,\u201d by Philipp Meyer, because his last historical novel, \u201cThe Son,\u201d was such an amazingly well-written, violently beautiful page-turner that I have to read what came before. \u201cFilm as Film: The Collected Writings of Gregory J. Markopoulos\u201d (obscure, yes, but I remember his underground films fondly from the Jonas Mekas/Film Comment days). And the ultimate bedside book \u2014 \u201c The Making of Americans ,\u201d by Gertrude Stein. I enormously respect its impenetrability. Maybe this is the best novel ever written, because you can\u2019t read it. Not even two pages. I know, I\u2019ve tried for the last 10 years.\nWhat\u2019s the last great book you read?\nMy friend Bruce Hainley had told me about a new book coming out called \u201cThis Young Monster,\u201d by Charlie Fox, but I had forgotten all about it until the publisher Fitzcarraldo Editions in London sent me this beautifully designed French-flap-style paperback original. Good God, where did this wise-beyond-his-years 25-year-old critic\u2019s voice come from? His breath of proudly putrefied air is really something to behold. Finally, a new Parker Tyler is on the scene. Yep. Mr. Fox is the real thing.\nWhat classic novel did you recently read for the first time?\nWell, I had read \u201c Swann\u2019s Way \u201d way back in the late \u201960s when I worked at Provincetown Bookshop, but I had never read Lydia Davis\u2019s translation, so I did recently because I loved her collection of short stories \u201cCan\u2019t and Won\u2019t\u201d so much. Can a translator have groupies? If so, I am hers.\nContinue reading the main story Advertisement\nContinue reading the main story What\u2019s your favorite book no one else has heard of?\n\u201cThe Joint,\u201d by James Blake. A sexy, funny gayly-incorrect prison memoir that Genet might have liked.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story What\u2019s the last book that made you laugh?\nThe book itself didn\u2019t make me laugh, but the title sure did: \u201cQueer Bergman.\u201d He wasn\u2019t.\nThe last book to make you cry?\n\u201c T he Visiting Privilege ,\u201d by Joy Williams. \u201cThe dead just forget you,\u201d a character reasons, and boy, that is a sobering, ego-crushing thing to tell someone.\nThe last book that made you furious?\n\u201c Spectacle: The Astonishing Life of Ota Benga ,\u201d by Pamela Newkirk. The true story of a Congolese man who is held captive and exhibited next to an orangutan in the Bronx Zoo in the early 1900s. Yes, I said true.\nWhat do you read for solace? For escape? For sheer pleasure?\nSolace? \u201cPol Pot,\u201d by Philip Short. I feel so lucky I didn\u2019t have to live under his rule. I don\u2019t want to \u201cescape\u201d when I read a book; I want to enter a new world that disturbs me. Sheer pleasure? Michel Houellebecq\u2019s novels always put me in a good mood.\nWhat are your favorite books about film? About art?\nI like film books at the bottom of the barrel and art books at the top. \u201cThe Ghastly One,\u201d by Jimmy McDonough, is a hilarious biography of one of the most hideous directors who ever picked up a movie camera, Andy Milligan. Even worse is \u201cA Thousand and One Night Stands,\u201d by H. A. Carson, the alarming story of porno star, drug addict and alcoholic Jon Vincent, who complains he didn\u2019t get enough credit for inventing onscreen sexual \u201cverbal abuse.\u201d On the other end of the spectrum is \u201cDaybook,\u201d by Anne Truitt, an intelligent, simple and moving record of what an artist\u2019s day-to-day life is really like.\nPlease recommend books about Baltimore or by Baltimore writers.\nAnne Tyler is now a friend (and we never agree on books we like), but I started reading her way before I met her. \u201c Ladder of Years \u201d is my favorite of hers, and it perfectly describes what it is like to be a Baltimorean; unpretentious, impervious to the outside world and layered in eccentric family traditions. Laura Lippman also writes about our fair city with a plot-driven, knowing, gritty and smart realism.\nWhich writers \u2014 novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists, poets \u2014 working today do you admire most?\nWhen her English publisher asked me for a blurb for \u201c Transit ,\u201d I sent back, \u201cRachel Cusk is too smart for her own good,\u201d and I meant this as the ultimate compliment. She doesn\u2019t suffer fools, and I like that in a writer. I gave Ottessa Moshfegh\u2019s novel \u201c Eileen \u201d to everybody as a Christmas present last year, and her new collection of short stories, \u201cHomesick for Another World,\u201d will scorch you like a blowtorch.\nPlease verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.\nInvalid email address.

And which do you avoid?\nI used to like true crime, despite having to browse in that obscure section of the bookstore way back near the restrooms, but lately there\u2019s been nothing published in that field that sends me over the moon. Science fiction is something I never understood. I would have no idea what is good or bad in that genre.\nAdvertisement\nContinue reading the main story How do you like to read?

It\u2019s really, really good.\nWhat\u2019s the best book you\u2019ve ever received as a gift?\nI collect weird sex pulp paperbacks, especially with the outdated slang word \u201cchicken\u201d in the title. I have 52 of them. Last year Kayo Books, my favorite used-book store in the world, sent me one I didn\u2019t have as a gift: \u201cChain Gang Chicken.\u201d\nWho is your favorite fictional hero or heroine? How about your favorite fictional villain?\nIgnatius J. Reilly in \u201c A Confederacy of Dunces \u201d is pretty hard to beat. Villains? Every character in Bruce Wagner\u2019s \u201cDead Stars,\u201d the cruelest book ever written.\nWhat kind of reader were you as a child?\nGrade school ruined reading for me by demanding book reports for such snore-a-thons as Benjamin Franklin\u2019s biography written for children. I wanted to read \u201cHot Rod\u201d and \u201cStreet Rod,\u201d by Henry Gregor Felsen, but my teachers hadn\u2019t heard of them. It wasn\u2019t until I was a teenager and Grove Press came along and introduced me to Burroughs, Marguerite Duras and the Marquis de Sade that I became a real bookworm.\nIf you could require the president to read one book, what would it be?\n\u201cSurgery of the Anus, Rectum and Colon,\u201d by J.
