A Chinese team boarded the vessel early on Sunday. \nThe first hijacking by Somali pirates in five years occurred last month, but this is the second raid since then. \nA spokesman for UK Marine Trade Operations (UKMTO) in Dubai, who co-ordinate safe passage for merchant vessels in the Gulf of Aden, said all on board the hijacked ship were safe and heading to an unnamed destination under escort. \nThe UKMTO said the crew was from Syria, but a statement by India's ministry of defence said they were from the Philippines. \nMaritime piracy threatens to return \nReports in India said the hijacked ship was travelling between the ports of Kenang in Malaysia and Aden in Yemen. \nThe UKMTO said navy ships from India, China and Pakistan (the last operating as part of an international combined task force) changed course to approach the Tuvalu-flagged ship soon after the alert was raised. \nThe crew had locked themselves in the citadel, a safe room inside the ship designed to protect those on board from pirates. \nThe crew from the Chinese ship boarded the hijacked ship at dawn today, freeing those on board. India's military said it is believed the hijackers fled the ship during the night. \nPiracy in the waters off Somalia and Yemen peaked in 2011, with more than 200 attacks. \nBut after five years with no raids, an oil tanker was seized and held for ransom by Somali pirates in early March and there have been a number of attempted seizures since then.

There has to be a response to such a crime. In August 2013, Ed Miliband\u2019s Labour Party and some rebel Conservatives prevented any retaliation , which has only led to further atrocities. \nSecond, Trump acted quickly, which is crucial to making a clear connection between the crime and the response.

No matter how you felt about the revival, it had a clear storyline for each generation of the Gilmore women and it delivered a satisfying inter-generational tale of grief, family, and embracing the curve-balls of life. \nTo return to Stars Hollow once more just because the show and its characters are beloved, would be a disservice to the actors and the intricate world that series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino built . As Graham said during Deadline's Emmy Contenders event, \"If it all existed in a vacuum, I would play that character until my dying day\u2026 Now it's become what could we do with this story that is satisfying, that is worth continuing. I don\u2019t know if there is a need to do more. I wouldn't want it to feel like we overstayed our welcome.\" Giphy \nNetflix definitely wants more Gilmore Girls . In March, Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos told the UK Press Association there have been \"preliminary\" talks about a sequel \u2014 although, Graham and Bledel maintain those talks have not reached the stage where the actors are involved. It's no surprise the streaming service wants to stay in the Gilmore Girls business, given how much buzz the revival generated, but creatively it doesn't make sense for the actors or Sherman-Palladino to commit to more Stars Hollow stories right now. \nGraham has a pilot, Linda From HR , in contention at Fox for the 2017-2018 TV season. Meanwhile, Bledel is set to appear in Hulu's highly anticipated adaptation of The Handmaid's Tale . The majority of the rest of the cast is just as busy: Milo Ventimiglia is deeply committed to his work on This Is Us , Matt Czuchry is working on a pilot , and Melissa McCarthy has basically confirmed she's content with how Sookie's story ended . \nLikewise, Sherman-Palladino and her husband/writing partner Daniel Palladino are awaiting news from Amazon about their new series The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel . The cast and the writers all appear to be embarking on new adventures and tackling new characters. They deserve to continue forward with their careers without feeling obligated to do more Gilmore Girls simply because of the nostalgia factor. Giphy \nWhen it comes to deciding the fate of Gilmore Girls , Bledel said it best, \"I'm just interested in telling a story that is dynamic and that I can hook into.\" \nAnything less would be a disservice to the fans, the actors, and the legacy of this amazing show. If inspiration strikes, and Sherman-Palladino comes up with another captivating chapter of the Gilmore story, then I am sure she will do everything in her power to make it happen. Until then, you can always return to Stars Hollow , and even better, you can support all of the amazing new projects the creative minds behind Gilmore Girls are working hard to bring to the screen.

Also Read: 'SNL': Writer   It's a Bad Idea (Video) \nO\u2019Reilly continued: \u201cIt was a firm no or like\u2013\u201c \n\u201cOh, man,\u201d Strong said, cutting him off and turning to an off-screen producer. \u201cCan we do that thing we talked about?\u201d The result had Strong\u2019s face and voice were blurred out. \nNext, O\u2019Reilly interviewed Trump \u2014 also Alec Baldwin \u2014 to thank him for his support during O\u2019Reilly\u2019s sexual harassment allegations. \n\u201cThank you, Mr. President, and thank you for coming to my defense even though no one ask you to,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said. \u201cYou even went as far as saying \u2018Bill O\u2019Reilly did nothing wrong.'\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s correct,\u201d Trump\u2019s Baldwin replied. \n\u201cBased upon?\u201d O\u2019Reilly asked. \n\u201cA hunch. A loose hunch,\u201d said Trump. \n\u201cYou are not familiar with the facts of the case?\u201d O\u2019Reilly continued. \n\u201cI\u2019m more familiar with this case than, say, health care,\u201d Trump told him. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t look into it much, no. I was busy being super presidential by bombing Syria.\u201d \n\u201cI appreciate your support on behalf of all women and thank you, Donald Trump, for promoting sexual assault month,\u201d Baldwin\u2019s O\u2019Reilly said. \n\u201cThat\u2019s right, Bill. It\u2019s a subject near and dear to my hand,\u201d Baldwin\u2019s Trump responded. \n\u201cThank you for stopping by \u2018The Factor, Mr. President,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said, ending the segment. \n\u201cIs that a joke?\u201d Trump asked before leaving \n\u201cExcuse me?\u201d \n\u201cA lot of people say \u2018Keep up the good work,'\u201d Trump explained, \u201cand I found out it was a joke.\u201d \nBaldwin\u2019s O\u2019Reilly finished the segment by promoting his new book, \u201cOld School: Life in the Sane Lane,\u201d about a return to \u201ctraditional values.\u201d\u201cIt couldn\u2019t have come at a better time,\u201d O\u2019Reilly said, signing off.   \nWe\u2019re in for at least (probably) four years of Donald Trump as President of the United States. That means lots of bad things and one particularly great thing: We\u2019re in for a lot more Alec Baldwin impersonations of Trump on \u201cSaturday Night Live.\u201d From the often ridiculous phrases to the weird outbursts, \u201cSNL\u201d has captured all of it. In fact, the sketches often seem to struggle to surpass reality in terms of absurdity. But they get there. Here\u2019s a list of every Baldwin-as-Trump \u201cSNL\u201d sketch, ranked from least to most hilarious, with links to the sketches. NBC \n12. Trump\u2019s Classroom Cold Open (Dec. 3) Trump retweets ridiculous people, like a 16-year-old and a white supremacist. This one\u2019s sadder than it is funny, though, because most of it doesn\u2019t even require jokes. You can watch that sketch here. NBC \n11. Donald Trump Prepares Cold Open (Nov. 19) Fresh off winning the election, Trump\u2019s completely unprepared. We already know that Mike Pence will do everything, but good effort, \u201cSNL.\u201d You can watch that sketch here. NBC \n10. Trump\u2019s Christmas Cold Open (Dec. 17) Vladimir Putin and Rex Tillerson drop by Trump Tower for Christmas. This one definitely brings to mind the phrase, \u201cNo puppet, no puppet.\u201d It's also, perhaps, the most outright terrifying of all of these. You can watch that sketch here. NBC \n9. Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton \u2014 Debate Three Cold Open (Oct. 22) Trump is winning \u201cevery single poll taken outside a Cracker Barrel,\u201d but it\u2019s Kate McKinnon as Hillary Clinton who steals this one \u2014 kind of like in real life. You can watch that sketch here. NBC \n8. Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton \u2014 Debate 1 Cold Open (Oct. 1) The first debate really found Baldwin hitting the Trump stride. It\u2019s mostly just him shouting \u201cGina\u201d in a very insistent tone (his weird pronunciation of \"China\"). \u201cYuge Gina\u201d gets a lot of mileage though. You can watch that sketch here. NBC \n7. Trump Takes the Appeals Court to 'The People's Court' (Feb.   here . NBC \n6. VP Debate Cold Open (Oct. 8) Trump nabs the spotlight from the vice presidential debate and realizes he needs to be a lot more careful about talking about sexually assaulting people while wearing hot mics. Describing himself as a gross groping hurricane is hilariously cringe-worthy. You can watch that sketch here. NBC \n5. Trump might have ties to Zorblat-9 as aliens invade (March 11) Trump spoke to American troops to rally them in a battle against super-powerful space aliens. Unfortunately, Trump's old standbys like \"we don't win anymore\" and \"we're going to bring coal back\" were not all that helpful. Most of the rhetoric is stuff we've heard before, but Leslie Jones' and Sasheer Zamata's moments near the end elevate the sketch.   NBC \n4. Hillary Clinton/Donald Trump Cold Open (Nov. 5) CNN doesn\u2019t care that Trump literally kisses the FBI, Putin and the KKK, instead pestering Hillary about emails. Alec and Kate heartwarming run through Times Square is the real sweet spot of the sketch. You can watch that sketch here. NBC \n3. Donald Trump vs. Hillary Clinton Town Hall Debate Cold Open (Oct. 15) Of all the debates, the second was the funniest. Trump lurking in the background and slipping past Hillary like he\u2019s the shark in a \u201cJaws\u201d movie completely captures the awkwardness of the real event. You can watch that sketch here. NBC \n2. Donald Trump Press Conference Cold Open (Jan. 14) It might be the lowest-brow of the sketches, but Trump accidentally talking about urine throughout his press conference is bested only by the line, \u201cI\u2019m not talking about the pee-pee, because it didn\u2019t happen and it wasn\u2019t as cool as it sounds.\u201d You can watch that sketch here. NBC \n1. Donald Trump and Steve Bannon call world leaders (Feb. 4) \n\"SNL\" channels two   other Trump news items to turn out a ton of jokes that channel absurdity while still finding new ways to be funny.

Celtic secured a first title for Rogers when Sinclair scored a hat trick at Tynecastle a week ago and the Parkhead board moved swiftly to consolidate the Northern Irishman\u2019s contractual position with an extension to 2021 . \n\u201cThe way he has got us playing he is going to be talked about going elsewhere and other teams coming in for him. That is no surprise at all but he loves the club,\u201d said Sinclair. \n\u201cHe supported them as a kid so he is always talking about that but he most enjoys developing players and getting their confidence raised again. It is great that the manager has secured his future. \n\u201cTo be honest, I think it will attract a lot of other players - especially coming from down south. People will look up here, look at the style we play, how we win games. When you bump into people they always say how well we have been doing.\u201d \nSinclair scored Celtic\u2019s second goal in Saturday\u2019s 3-1 home victory over Kilmarnock to take his tally for the season to 23 to stay on course for a personal best. \u201cEvery time I step onto the pitch I am trying to do as well as I can. I don't really have a target,\u201d he said. Celtic now and then combined \n\u201cI got 27 in my best season at Swansea and I finished off with a hat-trick in the play-off final. If I can reach that stage then great, but from my position to have 23 is not too bad. \n\u201cWhen you are in a tough time in your career you just have to dig deep. The easiest thing in football is falling off and the hardest thing is to get back on track. That is what it has come down to - going back into the gym and doing extra things on your own and one day get my rewards for working hard. \n\u201cIt is all credit to the manager. When you haven't played for a couple of years it takes time to get your form back. \n\u201cWhen I was at Villa and we got relegated, it was a tough time butI don't look back. I keep looking forward and the result is the season we are having now.\u201d \nC eltic are two wins away from a clean sweep of the Scottish honours and eight games out from the potential feat of going through a domestic campaign on three fronts without losing. Only three teams \u2013 Inverness, Rangers and Partick Thistle \u2013 have taken league points from them, but for a few minutes on Saturday it seemed Kilmarnock might be added to the list, when Jordan Jones scored midway through the second half to equalise Stuart Armstrong\u2019s opener. Scott Sinclair shoots wide Credit: PA \nH owever, Sinclair put Celtic ahead again in the 70 th minute and a James Forrest header spelt the end of the challenge from Killie, who came off the field to learn that, even had they prevailed at Parkhead, they would have been denied a finish in the top half of the Scottish Premiership by Partick Thistle\u2019s 1-0 home win against Motherwell. \n\u201cWe\u2019re devastated not to make top six,\u201d said Jones. \u201cWe can\u2019t beat ourselves up about it. We\u2019ve been doing really well and the lads have a lot of belief, so we can\u2019t allow this result to knock our confidence. \n\u201cWe\u2019re not stupid. We know we were massive underdogs, so we\u2019ve lost and it\u2019s brushed under the carpet. It\u2019s about Hearts on Friday now and we\u2019re full of confidence that we can take three points, no doubt about it.\u201d \nCeltic\u2019s next fixture sees them travel to Dingwall to meet Ross County on Easter Sunday, after which they have a double header against Rangers, first in the William Hill Scottish Cup semi-final at Hampden Park on April 23 and the final Old Firm league derby of the season at Ibrox six days later. \nRangers boosted their confidence with a significant victory over second-placed Aberdeen at Pittodrie, where Kenny Miller scored a double and Joe Dodoo netted another, all inside four minutes, to secure a 3-0 win. In only his fourth game in charge, Pedro Caixinha thus achieved a distinction \u2013 prevailing away to a direct rival \u2013 which had eluded his predecessor, Mark Warburton, in consecutive seasons in the Scottish Championship and Premiership. \n\u201cThat was a really crucial match for us because we were facing a very strong side,\u201d said Caixinha. \u201cEveryone was committed and they knew what they had to do. \n\u201cThe players did great, fantastic.

Print \nIt\u2019s three years away, and still a year before its scheduled dress rehearsal, but nervous observers are already asking: What happens to the 2020 U.S. Census under President Donald Trump? \nLast week marked three years until Census Day: April 1, 2020. Though it may sound like one of the driest bureaucratic responsibilities of the federal government, the Census has crucial implications for national politics\u2014and requires years of planning, hundreds of thousands of new employees and even a marketing campaign to ensure the broadest possible snapshot of the American population. \nAlready, Congress\u2019 inability to agree on a full-year funding measure for fiscal 2017 has forced the Census Bureau to cancel multiple field tests and delay opening three field offices. It also had to cut back on new, less labor-intensive methods for verifying household addresses, a critical undertaking that was supposed to make the 2020 Census more cost-effective and accurate. \nAnd more broadly, the Trump administration\u2019s hardline rhetoric and executive orders cracking down on undocumented immigrants may already be creating a major new risk for the census, making members of minority and immigrant communities less likely to respond. \n\u201cIf you imagine that the federal government is asking for personal information and you feel that the federal government is hostile and that if you were to answer this, perhaps they would use this against you,\u201d said Terry Ao Minnis, director of the census and voting programs at Asian Americans Advancing Justice. \u201cThat of course will make people less inclined to participate.\u201d \nThe U.S. Census is the largest civic action undertaken by the entire country\u2014a decennial event enshrined in the Constitution that aims to count every person living in the United States, regardless of race, gender or citizenships status. At least, that\u2019s been its intent since James Madison helped design the first census in 1790. \nBut census-watchers are increasingly warning that the 2020 Census could be hobbled. The Census requires a huge administrative ramp-up in the three years leading up to the national count, hiring hundreds of thousands of people and opening dozens of offices nationwide. The Census Bureau was one of few federal agencies outside the Pentagon to get an increase in Trump's 2018 budget\u2014but that $100 million increase is misleading, because the House and Senate had already each proposed to increase the Census Bureau\u2019s funding by around that amount for 2017. So at a time when the Census needs to be ramping up sharply\u2014it had requested a 21 percent increase for 2017, or $290 million\u2014Trump\u2019s 2018 budget represents no increase at all. \nBased on lack of funding and technical challenges, in January, the Government Accountability Office added the 2020 Census to its \u201chigh risk\u201d list of programs and agencies. Without extra money to ramp up, \"I am increasingly worried about a higher undercount in many communities,\u201d said Terri Ann Lowenthal, co-director of the Census Project, an organization which tracks the census. \u201cWe could be headed for a train wreck if the Census Bureau doesn't get the resources it needs.\" \nThe Census affects every corner of America, determining where hundreds of billions of federal dollars flow annually, where businesses open new stores and which states gain\u2014or lose\u2014seats in the House of Representatives in 2020 reapportionment. Businesses, trade groups and local communities have been tracking the progress for the 2020 Census for years, since its preparations first began before the completion of the 2010 Census. \nBut counting everyone is expensive, and especially so for hard-to-reach people, such as poor families who move frequently or immigrants fearful of government authorities. The government spends billions of dollars tracking down these people, eventually sending human enumerators into the field to follow-up with non-respondents. \nEach step of the process is fraught with political landmines, from where advertising dollars are spent to what kind of questions to ask people. At the end of March, for instance, the Census Bureau initially included sexual orientation questions in its list of planned topics for the 2020 Census before quickly publishing a revised version that omitted any reference to such topics, drawing sharp rebukes from LGBTQ groups and Democrats on Capitol Hill. (The Census says the original inclusion was a simple mistake.) \nImmigrant-rights groups, too, have been watching with concern. The decennial Census doesn\u2019t traditionally ask about immigration status, but Republicans, led by former Sen. David Vitter, have long wanted to do so. In January, a leaked draft executive order proposed directing the Census Bureau to include a question on immigration status on the \u201clong-form\u201d census, known as the American Community Survey, which is a longer, detailed survey for a subset of people living in the United States and is scheduled to be conducted in 2018. If the Census Bureau included an immigration-related question on the ACS but not on the census itself, it would raise questions about whether the White House intends to use the information collected on both the ACS and census to track down and deport undocumented immigrants. That could further discourage immigrants from participating in the census. \nWhite House spokesperson Michael Short did not respond to questions about whether the White House\u2019s policies and rhetoric could discourage participation in the Census, but said, \u201cThe administration has been very clear about its enforcement priorities, which are to focus on those here illegally who have criminal records as well as those who pose a threat to public safety or national security.\u201d The Census Bureau and Commerce Department both did not respond to detailed questions about their plans for the 2020 Census. \nOne other twist in the 2020 Census could raise trust issues: for the first time, Americans will be asked to respond online. This raises new cybersecurity concerns, as the Census Bureau will not only have to secure all the collected data, with tens of millions of online responses coming in in just a few days, but it will have to convince Americans that the data they submit online won\u2019t be hacked, the way other major federal personnel records systems have been. \u201cWe have never done an internet census. We presume it won\u2019t be hacked but if it gets hacked and it gets out right away, for heaven\u2019s sakes, people aren\u2019t going to send it in,\u201d said Kenneth Prewitt, a former director of the Census Bureau. If that happens, he added, the Census won\u2019t have trained enough human enumerators to go into the field and manually follow up with households. \nThe Census has had costly tech snafus before. In 2010, the agency commissioned a specially designed handheld computer for its employees going house to house to conduct follow-up surveys for non-respondents. Thanks to missed deadlines and technical problems, they abandoned the device late in the process\u2014instead sending census-takers out with paper forms. That failure ended up costing an additional $3 billion. \nThis time, Congress has told the Census it can\u2019t exceed the $12 billion it spent in 2010. It has made some major changes intended to save costs, from online forms to more efficiently updating its address book. By all accounts, it\u2019s a well-designed plan. Overall, the Census Bureau says these changes will save $5 billion\u2014though both the GAO and the Department of Commerce inspector general have questioned the Census\u2019s cost estimates. But experts said those savings will not happen unless Congress adequately funds the agency in the next few years so it can employ new techniques in updating its address book and test out its new technology.\u201cThey are missing out on some important preparation steps, and it\u2019s going to cause problems,\u201d said Howard Fienberg, a lobbyist at the Insights Association, a trade group which represents the research industry. \nThe White House rejected that critique, and says the Census has the money it needs to build out its systems now. \u201cThe increase proposed in the budget blueprint provides adequate funding for the Census Bureau to support IT system investments to conduct a modernized decennial census in 2020,\u201d said Coalter Baker, a spokesperson for the White House budget office. \nThe Census is one of the most impressive attempts any country makes to count its own people, a crucial building block for the world\u2019s largest economy that informs important business decisions, such as where to open a new store or whether a state is a good place to invest. \u201cOur Census data provides a level of transparency for our economy that gives our country a competitive edge over other countries and a failed Census puts that at risk,\u201d said a former congressional staffer who worked on census issues. \u201cIt all starts with statistics.\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s the gold standard,\u201d said Ken Fears, an economist at the National Association of Realtors, which produces a monthly housing report that uses census data for its baseline. \u201cIf the gold standard becomes silver, you have a problem.\u201d ", "entities": {"persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "trump"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "michael short"},

Ragnarok totally blew our minds when it was released this morning . It not only offers up thrilling, Hulktastic action, but also some brilliant extended looks at new characters, including Hela (Cate Blanchett), Valkyrie (Tessa Thompson) and The Grandmaster ( Jeff Goldblum ). What you may not have realized, however, is that the preview also gives us our first look at Karl Urban as Skurge - who you can see in the screenshot below: \nIf you missed this shot while watching the Thor: Ragnarok trailer for the first time, we can't really blame you. Skurge is only on screen for a brief moment around the 1:04 mark, and Karl Urban doesn't exactly look like Karl Urban with that shaved head. That being said, it's a badass shot that gets us excited to see him in action. \nWatching this first live-action version of Skurge, two things will likely pass through the minds of fans who are familiar with the character from the comics. The first is that he legitimately looks like he's been ripped off of the page of Marvel magazines, from the armor he's wearing down to the black markings on his head. The second most notable thing, however, is that he's not utilizing his most notorious weapon: his giant battle axe. \nSkurge (who is also known as the Executioner) doesn't exclusively use this battle axe in action, and he does have a history with using machine guns, but it is still surprising that our first look at the character in Thor: Ragnarok has him using a different weapon. That being said, in the comics he is also typically attached at the hip to The Enchantress (pictured above by his side), who is definitely not in the film, so we already knew going in that the film would be taking some liberties with the adaptation. \nGiven Karl Urban's talents, we are highly anticipating his performance in Thor: Ragnarok . We're hoping that the brief look at him in the trailer isn't representative of the size of his part in the finished cut... though if the Marvel Studios blockbuster is as great as its first preview, we might be waiting for one of the company's best movies to date this fall. \nWhat do you think of Skurge's look in Thor: Ragnarok ?

One Manchester restaurant has decided to ban them, but not for the reason you might think Share Get What's On updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing! Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nLook up at the dining room wall of Stockport's Where The Light Gets In , and you'll see a small wooden sign saying: 'no phones in the restaurant'. \nThat hasn't stopped people, mind. \nFacebook notifications, incoming emails and Instagram still have a seemingly irresistible call. \nBut if visitors are compelled to disobey and whip out their phone, there's no place to hide from the all-seeing kitchen, which has no dividing wall - and chef-patron Samuel Buckley often pulls people up on it. \n\"I'll just go over and say 'there's no phones in the dining room', and walk off and they realise I'm not joking. One guy just looked at me and said, 'you're kidding', like, 'how dare you'.\" \nSome might say that's an understandable reaction - whether you like it or not, mobile phones in the dining room are now the norm. \nIt's reported that 93 per cent of adults now own a mobile phone which can transmit and document our every move to family and friends all over the world. \nOne of the reasons people impulsively reach for a phone in a restaurant is to take a picture: Instagram is flooded with fodder. In 2014 it was reported that 90 new photos hashtagged #foodporn are uploaded to Instagram every minute, and with social media users rising by more than 176 million in the last year alone, it's very likely that in 2017 that number has rocketed. \nBut surprisingly, taking pictures is not why Buckley has banned phones. For him, it's more about the dining experience. Samuel Buckley, Where The Light Gets In (Photo: Dominic Salter) \nHidden in the eaves of a converted Victorian coffee warehouse, Where The Light Gets In serves diners a set tasting menu made with locally foraged and sourced ingredients. \n\"Our ethos is to make people sit and eat together \u2013 to enjoy good food and good wine,\" Buckley explains. \"People think I don't want them to take pictures of the food, but I'm not really bothered about that \u2013 they can take pictures \u2013 it's when people are on their phone talking, or on Facebook. \nHow a drunken night out led to Manchester's first rum distillery \n\"The idea of not turning tables is so that you can enjoy the whole night with your friends or family, the idea of no menus is so you don't have to decide what you eat so you can still spend time with your friends and your family without distractions. \n\"No distractions,\" he reiterates. \"And I think the phone is a massive distraction. Where The Light Gets In \n\"I've got a problem with someone who comes out with their girlfriend and sits on his phone and his girlfriend is just sat there with nothing to do. \n\"I just really wish people would enjoy a night out with their friends and family. My sentiment is pure, but it comes out as a bit pretentious.\" \nPutting Buckley's sentiments to one side, the issue of restaurateurs imposing rules on customers is enough to get some people's backs up. \n\"It's not for a restaurant owner to dictate conversation,\" says Franco Sotgiu, co-owner of Solita Bar and Grill - a wildly popular restaurant group serving beefed-up burgers, Inka grilled steaks and nachos from its four sites across Greater Manchester. Franco Sotgiu The best family friendly cafes in Manchester \n\"The customer dictates what we serve, not the other way around. We're crowd pleasers: we give people what they want. We know what our clientelle like and they like to take pictures of the food. \n\"I would say our food is quite photogenic anyway \u2013 big stupid things - and I think these days social media is a part of the dining experience. People want to tell their friends what they've had for tea, where they're going, and often before they go there's a build up on social media.\" \nAnd in terms of encouraging people to connect with each other, for Sotgiu, it's just not as easy as telling someone to put down their phone. \n\"Forced conversation never works. If someone is not a conversationalist, whether they've got a phone in front of them or not isn't going to make any difference,\" he says. \n\"I think young kids have been brought up with phones, if you tell a 14-year-old you can't sit with a phone for two hours \u2013 you're going to have a sulky kid, now I'm not saying that's right or wrong. \n\"And people are having conversations, but it may be about the pictures they have taken or the filters they have put on.\" Instagram \nIn other words, Solita - with nearly 40K likes on Facebook and 55.3K on Twitter - is a phone-friendly zone. \n\"If we had a sign up in our restaurants saying you can't use your phones, people wouldn't eat there \u2013 or not as many would. It's like having a sign saying, 'there's no wifi here, please think it's 1995 and speak to each other'.\" \n\"I understand what [Where The Light Gets In] is trying to do, and I respect it, but it just wouldn't work for us.\" \nSotgiu's opinions will ring true with many people. Customers are paying for a service - and should be able to use, take pictures of, and experience that service in any way they like. \nIn general, mobile phones have been happily accepted into our work and social lives. They help us express ourselves, keep in touch, socialise, and sometimes, they make us happy - right? \nNot according to some experts. \n\"It's a field called techno stress,\" explains Professor Sir Cary Cooper at Manchester Business School at the University of Manchester. \"For me the real problem is that families aren't talking to each other, not just families \u2013 how about couples? How about millennials? Two people sitting across the table from each other not talking but looking at their mobile phones: that's not healthy.\" \nAccording to Professor Cooper, it's not just relationships that can break down, mobile phones stop us from experiencing the moment, too. (Photo: Pexels) Manchester's first vegan dessert bar is now open \n\"People start taking pictures or selfies without actually looking at the glorious sights when they're on a walk or on holiday or eating in a restaurant. They're just constantly posting things for other people, not for themselves. They're not experiencing the moment \u2013 so that's not healthy for you. \n\"You're not getting the life satisfaction you would normally get. You're not relaxing your body, you're not enabling your body to unwind.\" \nAnd with work email notifications now popping up on our phones, some businesses have recognised the issue, Professor Cooper adds, and imposed their own mobile phone bans. \n\"Volkswagen are shutting off everyone's emails at 5pm and turning them back on at 9 - all the servers are blocked so you can't pick up any work emails. Even Rolls Royce has the 7-7 policy where you don't send emails to anyone outside those working hours,\" says Professor Cooper. \n\"The French have passed a law in parliament which forbids any manager from sending an email to any of their staff out of office hours.\" (Photo: Pexels) \nBut when it comes to mobile phones, factors affecting their usage is endless. On the negative side, there's the one-up-manship of eating out in a restaurant, the pressure to populate Instagram feeds with photos, the stress of answering calls at all hours. On the plus side, there's the advantages of free advertising for businesses, keeping in contact with friends, and documenting your own life story. \nIn reality, all of this is still relatively new, and everyone is trying to get their heads around it. In the end, one of the best ways to determine what's healthy is to look at what makes people happy, and go from there. \nAs Professor Cooper says: \"Really what people need more than anything is relationships. If you look at all the happiness surveys, what comes out number one? It's not how much money you earn, or your Twitter followers, but your relationships.

Based on the materials speed, the research team estimated that the bubbles formed from an energetic event between 6 million and 9 million years ago. \nRepresentational image \n\"Six-nine million years might sound like a long time in human years. But in terms of cosmic timescale, it is like the blink of an eye. Just to give you the scale, the universe is approximately 13.7 billion years old, and the dinosaurs became extinct around 66 million years ago. So, the last meal that the super massive black hole of the Milky Way had was after the dinosaurs became extinct,\" says Bordoloi. \n\"For the first time, we have traced the motion of cool gas throughout one of the bubbles, which allowed us to map the velocity of the gas and calculate when the bubbles formed,\" he says. \n\"It was a very strong and energetic event. It may have been a cloud of gas flowing into the black hole, which fired off jets of matter, forming the twin lobes of hot gas seen in X-ray and gamma-ray observations.

TWITTER 4/14/2017 Charlize Theron plays a superhacker who turns Vin Diesel against his 'Fast' crew in F. Gary Gray's franchise debut. \nAfter his surprisingly fun remake of The Italian Job in 2003, whose most memorable sequence revolved around a scene-stealing Mini Cooper, F. Gary Gray would seem to have been a no-brainer to direct a Fast and Furious installment \u2014 especially once Vin Diesel and his thrill-seeking clan segued from mere street racing to heists and other forms of high-speed mayhem. \nBut careers make left turns (in this case, a misfiring sequel to Get Shorty ), and it took the success of Straight Outta Compton to get Gray in, well, the driver's seat of this eighth installment of the stupendously successful cars-and-guns action franchise. The result isn't as big a gear-shift as some fans expected in the wake of original castmember Paul Walker's death. In fact, it recycles plot-twisting devices from earlier chapters and keeps action firmly in the street-hoods-save-the-world neighborhood entered a couple of years ago. Fate delivers exactly what fans have come to expect, for better and for worse, and it would be a shock to see it disappoint producers at the box office. \nAfter being forced to rejigger the last picture mid-production when Walker died, the filmmakers let him rest in peace here. His character is mentioned only twice: once, in a line that cements his retirement to idyllic family life, and later, in a predictable sentimental touch suggesting he'll always be part of the gang in spirit. \nWith due respect to the actor, who is clearly missed by his colleagues in real life, it isn't as if the Furious franchise is hurting for dramatis personae: When Dwayne Johnson came aboard in the fifth film, things started to feel crowded. Then came Jason Statham, then Kurt Russell, and now we have a villain played by Gray's Italian Job star Charlize Theron. Somebody get Bruce Willis on the horn, and we'll have ourselves a proper movie for Episode 9. \nIs it bloated? Damn straight. And even at well over two hours, Fate can barely find anything worth doing for Russell, a onetime onscreen badass who here functions as a sunglass-wearing expository device. The script actually has him say at one point that he feels obligated to \"check in on you from time to time.\" The words \"...so I can earn this easy paycheck,\" presumably, were left on the cutting-room floor. \nTheron, on the other hand, carries plenty of weight in the story; she appears, however, to have little fun doing it. Her supervillain, a genius hacker known as Cipher, sneaks up on Vin Diesel's Dominic Toretto in the middle of his Cuban honeymoon with Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and assures him he is about to go to work for her. Dom scoffs, in that one-note macho way of his, until Cipher hands him a phone whose screen we cannot see. Soon Dom is \"going rogue,\" stealing a very powerful EMP device from his buddies (who have just rescued it from evildoers at the behest of Dwayne Johnson's lawman Luke Hobbs) and delivering it to Cipher. Though scenes between Dom and Cipher give him ample opportunity to register his anger at being forced into her service, when he crosses paths with his old friends, Dom says nothing and keeps his big jaw clenched, appearing to have flipped loyalties overnight. \nYes, Furious scribe Chris Morgan used this device just two movies ago, when Letty returned from the dead as an amnesiac doing the bidding of some other villain, going so far as to shoot Dom before she eventually got her memory back and married the big lug. But let's forgive the self-plagiarism, because pushing Dom to the bad-guy side for a while briefly solves the Furious saga's biggest storytelling difficulty: convincing us there is a universe in which Diesel is more fun to watch than Johnson. Johnson had to sit out most of Furious 7 while his character recuperated from grievous wounds in a hospital; here, he leads Letty and company as they cope with Dom's defection and try to keep him from acquiring even more weapons of mass destruction. \nRelieved of this burden, viewers will happily go along with any other baloney churned up in Morgan's thick-witted script. Sure: That EMP can wipe out all the electronics on a fortified military base without disrupting the video display sitting right beside it. Yeah: Dom can somehow arrange a sensitive meeting with a powerful figure while living as Cipher's prisoner. Why not: The driver of a car who needs to communicate with supposed foes in other cars can just shout and have his instructions understood dozens of yards away, over the noise of zillion-horsepower engines and oncoming missiles. (Not to mention the submarine in hot pursuit behind them.) \nThere are no stunts here to top, or even to approach, the last film's skyscraper-to-skyscraper jumps, and it must be said that some feats \u2014 like driving a car up the ramp of an aircraft that hasn't bothered to land first \u2014 have come to feel rote. So let's focus on moments of pleasure: chief among them, a long scene in which Hobbs escapes from prison (don't ask) alongside his mortal enemy Deckard Shaw (Statham), the former Hulking out against guards and inmates alike while the latter practices his parkour. Or the few small moments early on when Tyrese Gibson gets to tweak his too-serious castmates with a throwaway quip. \"What this series needs is more Tyrese,\" you might say to yourself during the pic's middle hour or so. But then you see the actor being pulled around a frozen Russian lake, screaming in panic as he clings to the ripped-off door of an orange Lamborghini, and you say, \"This was not what I meant by 'more Tyrese.'\" \nFor a long time, it seems that the movie's wittiest moment will be a blink-and-miss-it gag involving a car's rear-view camera warning system. Then, toward the end, comes an extended sequence involving (no spoilers here) extreme violence, a wholly innocent bystander, an unexpectedly considerate brute and ear-protection devices. For a few minutes, Fate of the Furious might be funny even for someone who has never cracked a smile at one of Diesel's self-satisfied line readings. It seems unwise to count on more such moments in future installments.

Lonzo looks like a really promising NBA prospect, but he\u2019s not actually in the league yet, so why are so many people asking NBA players for their thoughts on Lonzo and his dad LaVar Ball ?\nThe truth is that Lonzo and LaVar have both touched a nerve in the NBA community and are lightning rods for conversation, so NBA players are going to continue to be asked about them. And if they want people to stop, they&apos;re going to need to follow  DeMarcus Cousins \u2019 lead and do what he did when TMZ Sports caught up with him recently and asked a couple questions about the Balls.\nRelated Can Lonzo Ball Really Be the Lakers\u2019 New Kobe? Lonzo Ball Reacts to LeBron James 'Mocking' His Shooting Form LaVar Ball Is a Genius Cousins was asked to name his top NBA Draft prospects, and he responded by throwing out the names De\u2019Aaron Fox and Malik Monk, who both played for Cousins\u2019 former school Kentucky. But when the TMZ cameraman asked him a question about Lonzo, he sidestepped it with the quickness.\n\"Never heard of him,\" Cousins said of the now-former UCLA guard before climbing into a waiting vehicle.\nHe has apparently heard of Ball\u2019s dad, though, because when LaVar\u2019s name came up, he gave a much different answer.\n\"His dad is legend!\" Cousins yelled.\nSo Cousins doesn\u2019t know Lonzo, but he does know his dad?

The income cap will be raised incrementally over the next three years, to $110,000 in 2018 and $125,000 in 2019. \nState lawmakers agreed to include the tuition-free plan, which Gov. Andrew Cuomo introduced in January, in the state budget they approved late Sunday night. The budget includes a record $7.5 billion for higher education. \n\u201cThere is no child who will go to sleep tonight and say I have great dreams, but I don\u2019t believe I\u2019ll be able to get a college education because parents can\u2019t afford it,\u201d Cuomo said in a statement on Saturday. \u201cWith this program, every child will have the opportunity that education provides.\u201d \nStudents must be enrolled full-time with at least 30 credits per year in order to qualify, and they are expected to cover housing costs. After students graduate, they are expected to live and work in New York for the same number of years funding was accepted. If students choose to leave the state, the scholarship would immediately convert into a loan. \nScholarship funds are accounting for other federal and state grants. More than 50 percent of students at State University of New York (SUNY) and City University of New York (CUNY) colleges are already paying nothing for tuition with state and federal need-based grants. Those students would not be eligible for the scholarship. \nPrivate school students from families making under the income cap would also benefit. Eligible students would get a maximum of $3,000. \nTennessee, Oregon, and Minnesota already have tuition free for two-year colleges, but New York is the first to extend coverage to four-year colleges. This comes just a week after Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) introduced the College For All Act in efforts to make tuition-free college an option for students across the U.S.", "entities": {"persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "bernie sanders"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cuomo"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "andrew cuomo"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "york"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "suny"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "city university of new york"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "state university of new york"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cuny"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "new york"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "big apple"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "minnesota"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "oregon"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "u.s."}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "tennessee"}]}}, {"url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9QCjJMm01ny2dDDlWS3UDm7Xo6WNZUtqnQMtE4d0vtlmSZdFSfJwRY7KdcllqwACdSQtsc8ehdMb9qLICLY0wMTvbHSIf2r.HZ03ZI3ETIVg--", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-10T13:26:00.000+03:00", "title": "How Merrick Garland could torment Trump", "rating": null, "thread": {"participants_count": 6, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9QCjJMm01ny2dDDlWS3UDm7Xo6WNZUtqnQMtE4d0vtlmSZdFSfJwRY7KdcllqwACdSQtsc8ehdMb9qLICLY0wMTvbHSIf2r.HZ03ZI3ETIVg--", "domain_rank": 531, "section_title": "Politics, Policy, Political News - POLITICO", "main_image": "http://static.politico.com/e7/66/0981827c4d3ca1a0282c3a352d51/170407-merrick-garland-2-gty-1160.jpg", "replies_count": 5, "site": "politico.com", "site_categories": ["news", "entertainment"], "title": "How Merrick Garland could torment Trump", "country": "US", "site_full": "www.politico.com", "spam_score": 0.0, "performance_score": 9, "uuid": "f0d97a76dc7b92c5232f708cd4f7cee747f9efae", "title_full": "How Merrick Garland could torment Trump - POLITICO", "published": "2017-04-10T13:26:00.000+03:00", "site_type": "news", "social": {"pinterest": {"shares": 6}, "gplus": {"shares": 37}, "facebook": {"comments": 318, "shares": 988, "likes": 3067}, "linkedin": {"shares": 53}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "site_section": "http://www.politico.com/"}, "language": "english", "external_links": [], "highlightText": "", "author": "Josh Gerstein", "uuid": "f0d97a76dc7b92c5232f708cd4f7cee747f9efae", "crawled": "2017-04-10T13:42:51.685+03:00", "ord_in_thread": 0, "text": "As Neil Gorsuch is sworn in to the Supreme Court, liberals are still teeming with anger over Merrick Garland being denied that same seat at the hands of Senate Republicans. However, many on the legal left are hoping the jilted Obama nominee can still play a role in thwarting one of the central thrusts of President Donald Trump\u2019s policy agenda: what top Trump adviser Steven Bannon famously called \u201cthe deconstruction of the administrative state.\u201d\nAs Trump presses to roll back regulations across the federal government \u2014 formally vowing to dismantle two rules for every new one issued \u2014 an article Garland wrote more than three decades ago has emerged as a kind of playbook for those plotting the legal resistance to Trump\u2019s campaign to unwind regulations aimed at protecting the environment, workers\u2019 rights and more.\nThe 1985 article in the Harvard Law Review, penned as the Reagan administration's deregulation initiative was gathering steam, emphasized the duties of courts to take a \"hard look\" at attempts to revoke federal rules. Garland argued that agencies revoking regulations must have at least as good a basis for killing a rule as they did for issuing it \u2014 and that the action be consistent with congressional intent.\n\u201cThe hard look demands that the agency show that the course it chose was reasonable in light of the relevant policies, alternatives, and facts,\u201d Garland wrote.\nAnother legal expert said there are unmistakable parallels between the Reagan-era deregulation effort Garland helped resist in the courts and the one Trump is embarking upon.\n\u201cThis is the world we are about to enter,\u201d said Paul Verkuil, a leading authority on the federal rulemaking process. \u201cYou have to be able to justify your decision to end a regulation. ... [Garland] pretty much knew what he was talking about. It was a dramatic and important article which got a lot of play.\u201d\nWhile Garland failed to make it to the Supreme Court, he will still wield significant authority over the Trump agenda from his current post as chief judge of the D.C. Circuit, a position he\u2019s slated to hold until 2020. Indeed, news stories from the Reagan era described the Washington-based federal appeals court as a key obstacle to that administration\u2019s regulatory agenda.\nCongress\nWhy Democrats have no regrets after McConnell's \u2018nuclear\u2019 blast By Elana Schor\nColleagues said they expect Garland to be highly engaged when challenges to Trump\u2019s deregulatory moves begin to come before the court.\n\u201cWhat I can say about it, is he would give it exacting and careful scrutiny,\u201d said Jack Quinn, a White House counsel under President Bill Clinton. \"I\u2019d be willing to say there\u2019s nobody who\u2019s more knowledgeable about this area of the law.\"\nWhile the Supreme Court sets the broad rules for the deregulatory process and takes up some of the most high-profile cases, the nitty gritty of applying those rules to individual agency actions is done by the D.C. Circuit. Often, it\u2019s the only court to review what agencies have done.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why the D.C. Circuit is commonly referred to as the second-most important court in the country,\u201d Quinn noted. \u201cIt\u2019s where the vast bulk of cases involving agency action are taken up.\u201d\nGarland declined several requests to comment for this article.\nHowever, during an argument he presided over late last month in a campaign finance case, the D.C. Circuit chief made clear he was concerned about the slippery slope of dismantling Federal Election Commission rules.\n\u201cThe question is how much of the entire structure collapses if we accept your position,\u201d Garland told an attorney pressing to loosen donation limits. \u201cThe rule of law requires me to apply the same logic in the next case that I apply in this case.\u201d\nGarland\u2019s 1985 article, one of just two full-length law review articles Garland wrote before being confirmed to the bench in 1997, stemmed from his personal involvement in a high-profile Supreme Court case on deregulation that is still routinely cited in courts, including his.\nIn that high court showdown, Garland was one of the key lawyers for State Farm insurance company in its challenge to the Reagan administration\u2019s revocation of a Carter-era requirement that new cars have air bags or automatic seat belts.\nGarland \u201cwas the intellectual center of gravity in that case on the plaintiffs side,\u201d recalled Quinn, who was on the same litigation team. \u201cHe really did have an incredibly important role.\u201d\nIn its 1983 ruling, the justices unanimously held that agency deregulatory actions were subject to substantive scrutiny by the courts, just as new regulations are. The court also took another important step, emphasizing that while agencies could change their minds about the value of a particular regulation, they could not ignore evidence they considered when putting the rule on the books in the first place.\n\u201cAn agency changing its course by rescinding a rule is obligated to supply a reasoned analysis for the change beyond that which may be required when an agency does not act in the first instance,\u201d Justice Byron White wrote.\nTrump has several ways available to him to counter or elude efforts in the courts to block his deregulation plans. And he\u2019s already using some of them.\nFirst, Trump is signing targeted pieces of legislation that knock out regulations the Obama administration put on the books in its final months in office. He\u2019s already signed 11 of these \u201cCongressional Review Act\u201d resolutions and has two more sitting on his desk.\nWith health care legislation stalled, Trump aides are billing this as the president\u2019s most significant legislative achievement in his early days in office.\n\u201cI think that this is a huge accomplishment in the first quarter,\u201d White House legislative affairs director Marc Short told reporters last week, claiming that the repealed Obama-era regulations will save the U.S. economy $10 billion over the next 20 years.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fulfilling a campaign promise,\u201d Short added. \u201cWe said this is something that is crippling the American economy and we\u2019re going to address it, and this is one of the vehicles through which we\u2019re addressing it.\u201d\nAnother way to roll back existing regulations is through a tactic known as \u201csue and settle.\u201d Some Obama rules and policies are already under challenge in the courts by business groups and conservative organizations. The Trump administration could acquiesce in the litigation, essentially allowing the courts to tie the government\u2019s hands.\nTRUMPOLOGY\nThe Happy-Go-Lucky Jewish Group That Connects Trump and Putin By Ben Schreckinger\nA third way is to simply ease up on enforcing the regulations. This kind of laxity is harder for liberal public interest groups to respond to, but also has its limits. As long as rules are on the books, most reputable businesses are going to try to follow them. So, taking a more casual approach to enforcement won\u2019t give the same kind of relief for business that the Trump administration is seeking.\nHowever, lawyers say the centerpiece of Trump\u2019s executive order on deregulation \u2014 the two-for-one requirement \u2014 gives plenty of fuel to legal challenges to any moves agencies make to roll back environmental, worker safety or other rules. It allows plaintiffs to claim that the revocation was done primarily to satisfy Trump\u2019s numerical quota.\n\u201cThat order is unconstitutional, illegal and stupid,\u201d Vladeck said. \u201cIf you really want to reduce the regulatory load, you can\u2019t use a shotgun, you have to use a scalpel.\u201d\nGarland\u2019s 1985 article notes that one court was suspicious about the seat-belt-related order in part because the White House press office issued a statement saying it was intended to help the auto industry. But auto regulators claimed the detachable automatic belts would be ineffective.\nOne lawsuit challenging Trump\u2019s executive order, and citing the case Garland was involved in, is already working its way through the courts and more are expected. As those cases head to Garland\u2019s court, some lawyers expect rough sledding that will, at a minimum, slow down Trump\u2019s deregulatory drive.\n\u201cThat actually is a hard road,\u201d said Wake Forest University law professor Sidney Shapiro. \u201cIf you hit a hostile court, they\u2019re going to find holes.\u201d", "entities": {"persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "merrick

NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough and Russian cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Andrey Borisenko are scheduled to leave the ISS in a Soyuz capsule and then make the three-and-a-half-hour journey to our planet\u2019s surface. Though if you want to watch these events unfold, it\u2019s going to be an early-morning wakeup call; the astronauts are slated to enter the Soyuz around 12:40AM ET tomorrow and then undock at 3:57AM ET.\nTomorrow\u2019s departure will wrap up a 173-day stay on board the ISS for the three leaving crew members. The trio launched to the station on the Soyuz in October of last year. This was the second mission to the ISS for both Kimbrough and Borisenko, and the first for Ryzhikov. During their stay, Kimbrough performed three spacewalks to swap out batteries and repair the outside of the ISS \u2014 bringing his total number of career spacewalks to six.\nWrapping up a 173-day stay on board the ISS With the crew set to leave tomorrow, it means that there\u2019s a new commander on the ISS. Earlier this morning, Kimbrough turned over command of the ISS to NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson, who has been on board the station since November. It\u2019s not the first time she\u2019s held this role, either. Whitson made history in 2008 when she became the first female commander of the ISS, and now she\u2019s making history again by becoming the first woman to command the station twice. It\u2019s just one of many records Whitson is breaking during her mission.\nWith the command swap, Kimbrough and the rest of the crew are all set to make the trip back to Earth tomorrow. After undocking around 4AM ET on Monday, their Soyuz will stay in orbit for a couple of hours, inching farther away from the ISS. Then at 6:28AM ET, the Soyuz capsule will ignite its engines for a few minutes, taking the vehicle out of orbit and putting it on its descent to Earth. The capsule is then scheduled to land about an hour later at 7:21AM ET in Kazakhstan.\nNASA plans to cover the entire departure and landing on its TV channel, starting with the astronauts\u2019 goodbyes after midnight. Check back then to follow the crew as they make the trip back home.", "entities": {"persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "shane kimbrough"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "sergey ryzhikov"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "peggy whitson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "andrey borisenko"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kimbrough"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "borisenko"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "whitson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ryzhikov"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "internatio"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "international space station start"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "nasa"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "iss"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "earth"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kazakhstan"}]}}, {"url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.22A_pb_llkPEmGEtZutb3mK9C_.kIt8Q3v8lBNYBLBRHd6pWKAvZgF1dt7_ssL0kfwP29IvV7QVQ1UGkZ795L1OiNduqzpChfpGAqhTUOlVx7SZAmdlAI.KPhiYSt1Ye9NnaMk3KELpR9lm4qAJcWOYIbK66ll04-", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-10T21:58:32.227+03:00", "title": "Kendrick Lamar's \"HUMBLE.\" Earns Highest Hot 100 Debut For A Rap Song In 7 Years", "rating": null, "thread": {"participants_count": 1, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.22A_pb_llkPEmGEtZutb3mK9C_.kIt8Q3v8lBNYBLBRHd6pWKAvZgF1dt7_ssL0kfwP29IvV7QVQ1UGkZ795L1OiNduqzpChfpGAqhTUOlVx7SZAmdlAI.KPhiYSt1Ye9NnaMk3KELpR9lm4qAJcWOYIbK66ll04-", "domain_rank": 892, "section_title": "HotNewHipHop.com", "main_image": "http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/image/620x412/cover/1491850029_73577ece638d07c424fc5d95c8740a38.jpg/5a506e2d2e2c6622ac0ef7397569eb5d/1491850024_9cd626b4744a177f98cff92e888fc22f.jpg", "replies_count": 0, "site": "hotnewhiphop.com", "site_categories": ["news", "media", "entertainment"], "title": "Kendrick Lamar's \"HUMBLE.\" Earns Highest Hot 100 Debut For A Rap Song In 7 Years", "country": "CA", "site_full": "www.hotnewhiphop.com", "spam_score": 0.0, "performance_score": 9, "uuid": "dd9b842786917ce0612e2e68e6b62ea852f16c61", "title_full": "Kendrick Lamar's \"HUMBLE.\" Earns Highest Hot 100 Debut For A Rap Song In 7 Years", "published": "2017-04-10T21:58:32.227+03:00", "site_type": "news", "social": {"pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 998, "likes": 998}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/realhotnewhiphop"}, "language": "english", "external_links": [], "highlightText": "", "author": "Trevor Smith", "uuid": "dd9b842786917ce0612e2e68e6b62ea852f16c61", "crawled": "2017-04-10T21:58:32.227+03:00", "ord_in_thread": 0, "text": "videos-icon x-icon Home > Music > Kendrick Lamar's \"HUMBLE.\" Earns Highest Hot 100 Debut For A Rap Song In 7 Years Kendrick Lamar's \"HUMBLE.\" Earns Highest Hot 100 Debut For A Rap Song In 7 Years 0 0 Posted by Trevor Smith   28 Views Lamar's new single enters the chart at no. 2. \nKendrick Lamar 's \"HUMBLE.\" is the rapper's highest charting solo single ever, and it's only the first week.

FilmMagic \nAccording to TMZ, Tanaka felt \u201cdisrespected\u201d when Carey and Cannon, 36, attended the Nickelodeon Kids\u2019 Choice Awards with their children on March 11. Tanaka would reportedly \u201clash back\u201d at Carey and her friendship with Cannon by flirting with other women. The site also reports that the choreographer had a penchant for expensive chains and watches, and Carey grew tried of footing the bill for his designer bling. Per TMZ, the pair have not seen or spoken to each other since they traveled to Cabo together at the end of March. '90s Pop Stars, Then and Now \nAs fans saw on season one of Carey\u2019s E! docu-series, Mariah\u2019s World , the Grammy winner\u2019s relationship with Tanaka turned flirtatious as her engagement to Aussie billionaire James Packer \u2014 whom she eventually split from last October \u2014 fizzled. Though they were spotted packing on the PDA during a romantic Hawaiian getaway in December, Carey didn\u2019t confirm that Tanaka was actually her boyfriend until a February 15 interview with the Associated Press . Celebrity Exes Reunited \n\"I'm just going to be like, 'I really don't talk about my personal life' because that's what I used to do and it really worked for a minute, back a while ago,\" she told the outlet. \"I just don't feel comfortable talking about my personal life. Can we just keep that private between us? Me and my boyfriend don't want to do that.\" \nFor his part, Carey\u2019s former spouse Cannon revealed earlier this year that he was skeptical about the \u201cHeartbreaker\u201d singer\u2019s romance with Tanaka , and the authenticity of their scenes on Mariah\u2019s World . \"First of all, I think the whole reality show is fake,\" the TV personality \u2014 who welcomed son Golden with ex-girlfriend Brittany Bell in February \u2014 said on SiriusXM's The Howard Stern Show on February 8. \"I'm a producer, so I know how [it works]. \u2026 I don't buy none of that s--t. \u2026 It feels like they wrote the story. That s--t is like a soap opera.\" \nUs Weekly has reached out to Carey's rep for comment. \nWant stories like these delivered straight to your inbox? Sign up now for the Us Weekly newsletter!

Credit: PA \nDouble Olympic champion Nicola Adams has won her professional debut fight as 'The Lioness' easily tamed her Argentinian opponent. \nThe 34-year-old underlined her potential world title credentials with a commanding 40-36 points win at Manchester Arena over Virginia Carcamo. \nAdams, who became the first female boxer to win an Olympic title at London 2012 before defending her crown at Rio 2016, has talked about her ambition of headlining a show in Las Vegas. The Lioness had her opponent comfortably cornered as the fight progressed. Credit: PA \nShe has already announced her second fight for her home city of Leeds next month. \nHer professional debut - fight without a head-guard for the first time - saw her display her 'Lioness' tag on her shorts after entering the ring in a bright white gown. \nAfter an even start to the four-round flyweight contest, Adams dominated the second round before delivering her best in the third. The double Olympian celebrated the clear first victory as she bids to one day contest a world title fight. Credit: PA \nCarcamo recovered to see the fight out but could not trouble Adams before the final bell. \nAdams was cheered on at ringside by her partner Marlen Esparza, another Olympian to have recently turned professional. \nAdams was released from her contract with GB Boxing's world class performance programme as she signed a pro contract with Frank Warren. \nHer career move means she will not be part of the Team GB squad for the build-up to the 2020 Tokyo Games.

While most were elated at the news, there were a few who took objection to the names being awarded. One among the awards that came under question was the award for Best actor which went to Akshay Kumar . In fact social networking sites were filled with trolls claiming that the National Awards Chairman Priyadarshan had been biased and granted the award to Akshay since the actor had signed him on to direct a couple of films under his banner. \nFinally clarifying on the same, Priyadarshan who has a close proximity to Akshay Kumar, laughed off the rumours stating that he isn\u2019t doing any film with Akshay Kumar. Further talking about his future projects, the filmmaker added that as of now he has just two ventures on his plate, one with Abhishek Bachchan that is tentatively titled Bachchan Singh , a commercial entertainer that is written by Rumi Jaffrey and the other with Ajay Devgn which will be a Hindi remake of Oppam . \nLater questioning the reasoning behind the rumours of him being biased and awarding Akshay Kumar, Priyadarshan flatly stated that he doesn\u2019t understand how people feel that he solely influenced a jury of 12 to take such an important call.

The teen swayed with the star, who sported a white floral corsage on her wrist, as the rest of his classmates watched in awe. \n$el (@ssoochoa) April 9, 2017 \nThe dance must've been a big night for Kylie considering she missed her own prom after dropping out of public school to be homeschooled. \nThe reality star, who flew on a private jet to Sacramento with Jordyn, dressed in a pink satin gown, cinched at the waist. Zach Effron as my prom date next ??? pic.twitter.com/fF0NgcA170 \nSyd Duhey, the sister of the girl that originally turned down Albert, tried to explain on Twitter why her sister rejected the guy who became the star of the night. \n\"she turned him down bc it was her friends older brother but STILL,\" she wrote on Twitter. Carolyn Lidster (@carolynlidster) April 9, 2017 \nThough it looks like Albert's not too heartbroken considering the amount of compliments he retweeted congratulating him on his famous date. \nThe night was also filmed for an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians .

It's evening, your baby won't sleep - so you take the little one on a night-time drive to help him or her nod off. \nBut that still means a disrupted night for the parents. Latest research shows they can typically expect little more than five hours sleep a night - and losing the equivalent of 44 days sleep - in just the first year of their child's life. \nHelp, however, could soon be at hand. SUPPLIED \nNo more night-time baby driving thanks to a smartphone app. \nFord has developed a cot that could simulate the motion, engine noise, and even the street lighting of those night\u2011time drives without anyone needing to leave home. \nTo all appearances a regular cot, the Max Motor Dreams, comes to life using a smartphone app. This enables it to record and then reproduce the comforting movement, lights and sounds of a particular journey. SUPPLIED \nMax Motor Dreams looks like an ordinary cot, but it offers special benefits. \n\"After many years of talking to mums and dads, we know that parents of newborns are often desperate for just one good night's sleep,\" says Max Motor Dreams designer Alejandro Lopez Bravo, of Spanish creative studio Espada y Santa Cruz, which produced the award-winning design. \n\"But while a quick drive in the family car can work wonders in getting baby off to sleep, the poor old parents still have to be awake and alert at the wheel. \n\"This development could make the everyday lives of a lot of people a little bit better.\" \nFor now, the Max Motor Dreams is a one-off pilot.

Then again, if you can face the Deadman on wrestling\u2019s biggest stage and not only live to tell the tale, but also come out with the win, a Twitter hater isn\u2019t scary or intimidating in the least. \n\u2014 Roman-Reigns.\u2115et (@RomanReignsNet) April 8, 2017 \nStill, even with Roman Reigns\u2019 big win at WrestleMania 33 , questions remain as far as what the WWE has planned for Roman Reigns next. There has been speculation floating around within the last few days that Kane may be eyeing a return to WWE action, and that he may bring the hellfire and brimstone to take on Roman Reigns and avenge the Undertaker\u2019s loss. \nWith Roman Reigns notching recent wins in his belt against Braun Strowman and The Undertaker, there is certainly speculation regarding who the next big dog will be that could challenge Roman Reigns, and Kane would most certainly fit the bill. \nOn the other side of that coin, Roman Reigns has also already proven that he can withstand the Choke slam and Tombstone, and perhaps his recent bout with The Undertaker could serve him well should he suit up to take on Kane. That said, however, if the hellfire and brimstone were to ever come down on Roman Reigns, he may need more than his Superman Punch and Spear to come out of the match victorious. \nEither way, with fans booing and cheering him in equal measure, it will be interesting to see just what the WWE decides to do with Roman Reigns moving forward. The odds are good that they will continue their push of the \u201cBig Dog,\u201d and it will be up to Roman Reigns to make sure that he defends his yard.

Image caption Telegram detailing death of Robert Wylie who was killed at Battle of Arras \nAmong those attending the event in Arras will be the moderator's wife, Margaret Barr. \nShe plans to lay flowers on the grave of her great uncle, David Wyllie, who lost his life in battle at the age of 29. \nBorn in 1888 and the eldest son of Robert and Jane Wyllie from North Berwick, David was fatally injured by gunshots during the six-week offensive. 'Bad trenches' \nHe joined up, despite being exempt because of his occupation as a farmhand. \nHe later sent postcards home of quaint French villages with their names blacked out so they could not be used by the enemy to target troops. Image caption Margaret Barr holds a photo of her great uncle David Wyllie who died in battle \nThe only hint of the terrible conditions he experienced was a line in a letter that said he had just been in \"bad weather and bad trenches, so we had anything but a pleasant time of it.\" \nAnd replying to a letter saying the family now had two cars, he said: \"I would not mind if I was at home again having a run around in them.\" He was killed not long after sending that letter. \nMrs Barr still has the telegram that was sent to David Wyllie's father informing him of his son's death. 'Emotional day' \nSpeaking ahead of the ceremony in France, she said: \"It's a huge privilege to go out to Arras and represent the family, and to lay a wreath. It will be quite poignant. I will go and see his grave at Duisans Cemetery and lay flowers there. \n\"I think my father would be very proud and happy that one of his family will be there at the ceremony. \n\"It will be a very emotional day.\" Image caption Donald Mackay enlisted in 1914 and served for 31 months without leave before being killed \nJoining the commemorations in Edinburgh will be Margery Mackay, whose Uncle Donald also fought in the battle and died on 28 April 1917 after being caught in an ambush. \nHe had joined up in September 1914 and went 31 months without leave before he found himself on the front line in Arras. \nShe said: \"It was only after the loses in the Somme that the regiment was moved to Arras.\" \nMrs Mackay became interested in his story after finding and reading his last letter home. Image caption Last letter written by Donald Mackay who was killed in Arras \nShe said: \"He seemed to be just an average ordinary man of the day, who really felt that they had to go and fight. In his letter he talks about his family and really seemed to care for them.\" \nShe added: \"I really don't think they knew what they were getting into and they ended up in such horrific conditions, but in his letter he talks about being in the army for 31 months, not having had any leave and that his conduct was good. \n\"He still sounded quite sane and he still sounded as if he was prepared to do his duty and I just feel this is almost like a last chance to remember him.\" Related Topics", "entities": {"persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "david"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "margery mackay"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "margaret barr"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "robert"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "donald mackay"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "mrs mackay"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "david wyllie"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "jane wyllie"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "uncle donald"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "robert wylie"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "mrs barr"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "place des heros"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "faubourg d'amiens commonwealth war graves cemetery"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "western front"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "arras"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "north berwick"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "france"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "scotland"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "duisans cemetery"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "edinburgh castle esplanade"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "edinburgh castle"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "edinburgh"}]}}, {"url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8PNFiyeppbHp7XHxzz_R3qTYcqYWLeiAbxPeCsxSFSFOJsc_B9YzFLBBbZi7asnW08UotEZ3j9ryMum6cReP4uRqvBzmh3sDKdlw_dFM_PeM3yyNa7ZmKXa2YpeSg9B8U-", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-11T10:33:25.944+03:00", "title": "Bullies threaten child with hockey stick at Blenheim park", "rating": null, "thread": {"participants_count": 1, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8PNFiyeppbHp7XHxzz_R3qTYcqYWLeiAbxPeCsxSFSFOJsc_B9YzFLBBbZi7asnW08UotEZ3j9ryMum6cReP4uRqvBzmh3sDKdlw_dFM_PeM3yyNa7ZmKXa2YpeSg9B8U-", "domain_rank": 2757, "section_title": "Stuff.co.nz - Stuff", "main_image": "https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/i/g/l/x/k/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.620x349.1ifrrn.png/1491895558280.jpg", "replies_count": 0, "site": "stuff.co.nz", "site_categories": ["news", "entertainment"], "title": "Bullies threaten child with hockey stick at Blenheim park", "country": "NZ", "site_full": "www.stuff.co.nz", "spam_score": 0.0, "performance_score": 9, "uuid": "eb4ede88a924ec004eb23f66bc158bf0f9934c13", "title_full": "Bullies threaten child with hockey stick at Blenheim park", "published": "2017-04-11T10:33:25.944+03:00", "site_type": "news", "social": {"pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 975, "likes": 975}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "site_section": "http://www.stuff.co.nz/rss/"}, "language": "english", "external_links": [], "highlightText": "", "author": "JENNIFER EDER", "uuid": "eb4ede88a924ec004eb23f66bc158bf0f9934c13", "crawled": "2017-04-11T10:33:25.944+03:00", "ord_in_thread": 0, "text": "Bullies threaten child with hockey stick at Blenheim park JENNIFER EDER Last updated 19:25, April 11 2017 SCOTT HAMMOND/Stuff.co.nz \nBlenheim pupil Jaxson Dinmore, 10, used his jiu jutsu training to defend himself when bullies attacked him at a local park. \nA young Blenheim boy has used his jiu-jitsu skills to fend off a couple of bullies trying to start fights in the park. \nJaxson Dinmore, 10, was playing at Oliver Park, in Blenheim, with friends on Monday afternoon when two boys about his age came over. \n\"I'd seen them before at the park.

Then they threatened to kill me,\" Jaxson said. \nOne of the boys hit Jaxson's bike repeatedly with the hockey stick, breaking the brake cable and denting the wheel. \nJaxson ran home with the bike. \nThe Dinmores told police what happened but did not lay a formal complaint. \n\"We just want them to be aware in case something else happens.\" \n\u200bHis father Nick Dinmore said he was impressed the high school students stopped to help, and hoped others would follow their example. \n\"It's quite incredible, college kids stepping in like that.

I'm speechless. There are good people out there,\" she said.\u200b \nJaxson's parents told him to come straight home if he saw the bullies again. \n\"What do you do?

The eighth installment of the action series, The Fate of the Furious , is arriving in theaters this Friday, and anticipation is high with the movies being as popular as ever. That being said, past installments have a checkered past with film critics, so it's always a curiosity when reviews start to break for the new titles. We're now in the midst of getting that reaction as the first write-ups have started to arrive online, and it appears that the feelings are fairly mixed. \nWith about five days to go before director F. Gary Gray 's The Fate of the Furious arrives in theaters, Universal Pictures has lifted the review embargo for the blockbuster, and so far the internet features opinions both disappointed and excited by movie number eight. In his review for Variety , for example, Owen Gleiberman questions whether the move away from the franchise's street racing origins has ultimately been a positive thing, but also notes that the new adventures is still thrilling in its own right: \nIn the end, I'm not sure how I feel about our heroes being made into a pack of world-saving James Bonds, but what's clear is that there's probably no turning back. Most franchises, after eight films, are feeling a twinge of exhaustion, but this one has achieved a level of success --- and perpetual kinetic creative energy --- that's a testament to its commercial/cultural/demographic resonance. \nWhile giving it a modest C- grade, David Ehrlich's review for Indiewire is far less kind to The Fate of the Furious . Many will agree that the franchise has a bit of a rocky history where quality is concerned, but Ehrlich calls it the worst movie that we've seen so far in the series, and says that it even goes as far as to undermine the key themes that have been hammered into audiences for 16 years: \n\"F8\" is the worst of these films since \"2 Fast 2 Furious,\" and it may be even worse than that. It's the \"Die Another Day\" of its franchise --- an empty, generic shell of its former self that disrespects its own proud heritage at every turn. How did the great F. Gary Gray, whose surprisingly strong remake of \"The Italian Job\" displayed a tremendous flair for comedic vehicular mayhem, waste the biggest budget of his career on such boring smash-ups? How did Diesel and co. manage to learn all of the wrong lessons from the last two movies, delivering an episode where everything feels so fake that even the \"family\" matters seem forced? \nWriting for Entertainment Weekly , Leah Greenblatt isn't exactly effusive about the film, but does give it a passing grade. In particular, she praises the performances and contributions of both Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham, who were late additions to the franchises (arriving in Fast Five and Furious 7 , respectively), but still wind up stealing the show from Vin Diesel and Co. In her Fate of the Furious review, she wrote: \nThankfully, it's frequently also much funnier and lighter on its feet than previous outings, and a lot of that credit goes to Statham and Johnson, whose love-hate bromance feels like the real core of the movie: Statham revels in his Cockney-you-wish-you'd-never-messed-with shtick, and Johnson is, as always, the human Humvee with a heart of gold: snapping handcuffs in half like breadsticks, bench-pressing cinder blocks for kicks, and lifting opponents by the scruff of the neck as if they were wayward kittens. (He's also super committed to his daughter's soccer team.) \nEven with these reviews out in the atmosphere telling audiences that the film isn't exactly the best chapter yet, The Fate of the Furious is a film that will very likely wind up being critic-proof as it arrives in theaters this Friday, April 14th .

'Sesame Street' introduces its newest muppet character, Julia, a little girl who has autism, and skillfully sidesteps some common representational traps. \nA TV show that\u2019s set an example with diversity casting and inclusiveness pretty much from the day it started in 1969, Sesame Street has once again helped to make the world a little bit sunnier, a little bit better. On April 10 on HBO, the show will introduce viewers to Julia, a muppet character with autism, thereby helping children and parents to understand a condition they\u2019ve probably encountered many times before (it\u2019s thought to affect 1 in 68 children in the U.S.), but may not completely understand yet. \nJulia first appeared in 2015 in an online storybook called We\u2019re Amazing, 1, 2, 3! where she meets Street regular Abby for the first time through Elmo. The red muppet explains that, \u201cElmo\u2019s daddy told Elmo that Julia has autism, so she does things a little differently.\u201d Note that there\u2019s no judgement in that statement, no stigma or censure. Julia does things differently, but that doesn\u2019t make her wrong or weird or any kind of problem. If she likes to make her blocks into a wall instead of tower, or spin the tires on toy cars instead of scuttling them on the ground, then viva la difference says Elmo and his friends. As you would expect from the brand that\u2019s always been completely in step with the latest thinking on positive representation, it\u2019s never even hinted here that autism is even a disability or a disorder; it\u2019s just an explanation as to why she may not react to things the same way as everyone else. \nThis descriptive, pleasingly matter-of-fact approach extends to how Julia is brought into the world of the TV show. Practically replicating her first encounter with Abby, when she first meets Big Bird she doesn\u2019t react when he speaks to her and instead just walks away. Big Bird immediately assumes, just as Abby did in the storybook, that Julia must not like him. But friendly grown-up Alan (Alan Muraoka) explains that it might seem that way because she just met him, but there\u2019s more to it than the fact that she may be \u201cshy.\u201d It\u2019s because she has autism, he explains. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s autism?\u201d asks Big Bird. \nAlan takes a deep breath, one many teachers and parents will instantly relate to. Instead of going into anything about brain chemistry, genetics or the triad of impairments, Alan (and by extension, the show) keep things sensibly concrete and in terms kids can understand. Julia\u2019s autism means that she may not answer people when they talk to her, and that she might not do things they expect. When she does talk, her speech may be limited or echo things other people say. At one point in the episode, Julia gets very agitated when an emergency vehicle goes by with its siren blaring. All the others recover and ignore it, but Julia stays upset and needs to go away to her quiet spot to calm down and stroke Fluffster, her toy bunny. \nLike many children on the spectrum, Julia flaps her hands, something Big Bird, being of avian descent himself, can definitely relate to. In news features elsewhere, it\u2019s been reported that the character designers had to find a way of letting the Julia puppet move both arms for her flapping motion, whereas most muppets move only one arm at a time. Incidentally, Stacey Gorden, the puppeteer who operates and voices Julia, not only has a son of her own on the spectrum, but before he was even born she worked with children diagnosed with autism \u2014 facts that consolidate the show\u2019s bona fides and the sense that Julia has evolved from the input of many hands who understand the condition well, from the inside out. \nWe should expect, because it seems to be par for the course these days, that there will be those who will take issue with the show, decrying, for instance, that Julia is operated by someone who is \u201cmerely\u201d the parent of someone with autism, and not a puppeteer with autism herself. There will always be diversity representation purists, for want of a better term, who will never be content until there\u2019s a total 1:1 equivalence in all casting, so only people with cerebral palsy, say, can play people with cerebral palsy, and only actors with Down Syndrome play people with Down Syndrome, lesbians play lesbians and so on. \nControversy could be milked from the smallest details here, so there may be those who complain that once again, Sesame Street is reinforcing the misleading clich\u00e9 that autistic people have special gifts that compensate for the things they\u2019re not good at. For example, Julia may not speak as fluently as the other 4-year-old characters on the show, but the picture she draws of Fluffster when we first meet her is artistically and developmentally years ahead of the self-portrait and landscape that Abby and Elmo have drawn. That\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t people on the spectrum who are great at drawing, because of course there are, but it\u2019s often a source of frustration within the community of those affected by autism that outsiders so often expect freakish, savant-like abilities like in Rain Man where more often than not, none exist. \nOn the other hand, scrutineers might applaud the fact that the producers have chosen to make Julia someone who has noticeable verbal and social impairment, a child who is clearly challenged by language and the rules of social engagement rather than one of those people with a degree of autism that\u2019s easily manageable for public consumption. On the slim amount of evidence seen here (and I hasten to point out that I am not a pediatrician or a psychiatrist, only a mother of a child on the spectrum), Julia seems to less able than, say, Sheldon in The Big Bang Theory , who only a few years ago would have been described as someone with Asperger Syndrome rather than someone with autism. (They are now seen as just points in the same big spectrum by the American Psychiatric Association's latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders or DSM-5 .) \nToo often, the less able people with autism have been barely represented in film and TV depictions outside a small handful of titles (like, for instance, the excellent Australian film The Black Balloon ), so it\u2019s refreshing to see Sesame Street taking a step in this direction in a manageable, G-rated way. The show is highly unlikely to show Julia still needing diapers as an adolescent because she can\u2019t be potty-trained, but that\u2019s probably a good thing. Let\u2019s accentuate the positive. \nCast: Big Bird (Caroll Spinney), Julia (Stacey Gorden), Elmo, Abby Cadabby, Alan Muraoka, Tw0-Headed Monster, Fluffster, Cookie Monster, Roscoe Orman, Alison Bartlett, Emilio Delgado, Bob McGrath, Loretta Long, Chris Knowings, Suki Lopez Creator: The Children\u2019s Television Workshop Showrunner: Sesame Workshop", "entities": {"persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "abby cadabby"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "julia"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "bob mcgrath"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "abby"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "emilio delgado"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "sheldon"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "suki lopez"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "caroll spinney"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "alan muraoka"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "alison bartlett"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "elmo"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "alan"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "roscoe orman"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "loretta long"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "stacey gorden"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "chris knowings"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "sensitivity youtube"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "children\u2019s television workshop"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "hbo"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "american psychiatric association"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "u.s."}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "big bird"}]}}, {"url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRULI3Cl7YN6x1S4FCvs99G1Xq9E2.6xagQiLpGlitf.lBn3idoUXGb9hNu3a_tzRIPKBhn2Ktkiw--", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-09T04:13:46.848+03:00", "title": "This Numbers Test Will Determine If You're An Introvert Or Extrovert", "rating": null, "thread": {"participants_count": 0, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRULI3Cl7YN6x1S4FCvs99G1Xq9E2.6xagQiLpGlitf.lBn3idoUXGb9hNu3a_tzRIPKBhn2Ktkiw--", "domain_rank": 137, "section_title": "BuzzFeed - Latest", "main_image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-04/6/14/tmp/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/tmp-name-2-29139-1491503489-3_dblbig.jpg", "replies_count": 0, "site": "buzzfeed.com", "site_categories": ["news", "entertainment"], "title": "This Numbers Test Will Determine If You're An Introvert Or Extrovert", "country": "US", "site_full": "www.buzzfeed.com", "spam_score": 0.0, "performance_score": 9, "uuid": "975bde16114b8da0bd11d88a3f2df83fd66bfce4", "title_full": "This Numbers Test Will Determine If You're An Introvert Or Extrovert", "published": "2017-04-09T04:13:46.848+03:00", "site_type": "news", "social": {"pinterest": {"shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"comments": 29, "shares": 915, "likes": 915}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/buzzfeed/UteY"}, "language": "english", "external_links": [], "highlightText": "", "author": "", "uuid": "975bde16114b8da0bd11d88a3f2df83fd66bfce4", "crawled": "2017-04-09T04:13:46.848+03:00", "ord_in_thread": 0, "text": "This Numbers Test Will Determine If You're An Introvert Or Extrovert You got: Introvert \nThat's right.

She's been chummy with him for sure, mostly for the benefit of their twins. They vacation as a family and go to dinner and parties together, sometimes without the kids. We're told it drove Bryan insane. \nWe're told Bryan would lash back at her by flirting and even coming onto women in plain view of Mariah. \nThe last straw came at the Kids' Choice Awards last month, when Nick and Mariah took the twins. We're told Bryan felt the display \"disrespected\" him and during the event he demanded she come home. \nAs for the cash register part, we're told Mariah got sick of footing the bills for her BF ... for things like Gucci and Balmain and super expensive shoes. Bryan also loves jewelry, and we're told he was always in the market for expensive watches and chains ... and guess who footed the bills? \nShe also felt Bryan slid in after she broke up with James Packer , and his endgame was fame. \nThey haven't seen or spoken to each other since they went to Cabo together at the end of March. \nThey were together for a little over 5 months .

Image caption The drink has been made by the Benedictine monks of Buckfast Abbey in Devon since the 1920s and a new winery was built in 2011 Buckfast wine In the 1920s Benedictine brothers developed tonic wine sold from the abbey The base wine was first imported from Spain, and nowadays from France Ingredients include red wine, phosphates, caffeine and vanillin In 1927, distribution and sales were passed to J Chandler in Andover, Hampshire In 2011, a new winery was completed at the abbey. The site has four vats, each holding 130,000 litres of wine \nIts vice president Alistair McBay said: \"The monks should be setting an example as a religious organisation but the opposite is happening.\" \n\"The question needs to be asked 'Are they serving God or Mamon?\" \nLast year the abbey said it supported alcohol education charities like Drinkaware , a fact disputed by the charity. \nIt has made about \u00a388m since 2004 from royalties made on each bottle of Buckfast sold, according to the Charity Commission. \nThe trust justifies its existence as a charity in its annual report, stating its aim is the \"advancement of the Roman Catholic religion\". Image copyright PA Image caption Buckfast Tonic Wine has been made by Benedictine monks at Buckfast Abbey in Devon for almost 100 years and is particularly popular in Scotland and Northern Ireland \nIn a statement, it said it would contact the Charity Commission. \nA Scottish sheriff said last year there was a \"very definite association between Buckfast and violence\". \nIn 2015, the Scottish Prison Service found 43.4% of inmates had consumed Buckfast before their last offence, despite it accounting for less than 1% of total alcohol sales nationally. \nThe Charity Commission said it took \"all complaints about registered charities seriously\" and would \"assess the information about the Buckfast Abbey Trust to determine if there is a regulatory role for the Commission\".", "entities": {"persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "jonathan morris"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "alistair mcbay"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "bucky"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "j chandler"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "bbc news online"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "benedictine"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "charity commission"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "buckfast abbey trust"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "national secular society"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "prison service"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "pa image"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "france"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "scotland"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "andover"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "spain"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "northern ireland"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "hampshire"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "buckfast abbey"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "devon"}]}}, {"url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.4snjSUV.tkGFD_3yflZe4HBJUv2DGXWJtqE4mQ6jWlJBZRgmHHPhKiZeyVFwd5_YWnQYH.t3BTTrXCx5cE45CBHOo2dynA3g-", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-09T16:04:07.881+03:00", "title": "Boy asks teen girl for picture of 'what's under your towel?' and is left wishing he hadn't", "rating": null, "thread": {"participants_count": 1, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.4snjSUV.tkGFD_3yflZe4HBJUv2DGXWJtqE4mQ6jWlJBZRgmHHPhKiZeyVFwd5_YWnQYH.t3BTTrXCx5cE45CBHOo2dynA3g-", "domain_rank": 804, "section_title": "mirror - Home", "main_image": "http://i1.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10189690.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/JS116530502.jpg", "replies_count": 0, "site": "mirror.co.uk", "site_categories": ["news", "entertainment", "sports"], "title": "Boy asks teen girl for picture of 'what's under your towel?' and is left wishing he hadn't", "country": "GB", "site_full": "www.mirror.co.uk", "spam_score": 0.0, "performance_score": 9, "uuid": "a0eb5724228a6d2eddfdb755166bdc35688066d0", "title_full": "Boy asks teen girl for picture of 'what's under your towel?' and is left wishing he hadn't - Mirror Online", "published": "2017-04-09T16:04:07.881+03:00", "site_type": "news", "social": {"pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 2}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 979, "likes": 979}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/co/xBxtI"}, "language": "english", "external_links": [], "highlightText": "", "author": "mirror.co.uk", "uuid": "a0eb5724228a6d2eddfdb755166bdc35688066d0", "crawled": "2017-04-09T16:04:07.881+03:00", "ord_in_thread": 0, "text": "Boy asks teen girl for picture of 'what's under your towel?' and is left wishing he hadn't Michael was certainly persistent   Share   Comments By Zahra Mulroy 13:42, 9 APR 2017 Updated 13:43, 9 APR 2017 News Teen girl has perfect response to man asking her 'what's under your towel http://shitty-dad.tumblr.com/   Share   Comments Get daily   The perfect way of dealing with an unsolicited request for nude pictures is to have 19 towels to hand and a bath robe.\nThis was how 16 year-old Jacquie Ross chose to handle several texts from a boy she knows asking her \"what's under your towel?\" \nThe North Carolina teen had just got out of the shower and was discussing outfits with Michael, who is on the prom committee at her school.\nWhen he asked her to show him her outfit, Jacquie replied \"I am not fit for being seen right now believe me\" and sent him a photo of her in a towel with a face mask on.\nThings escalated from that point on. Ignoring the fact Jacquie probably just wanted a quiet home spa session, Michael decided to push his luck and ask \"what's below the picture?\"\nMichael pushes his luck A stickler for detail, Michael then asked \"what's under the towel?\" Jacquie's response was to sass him with another towel.\nTa-da! And again. Jacquie's response was perfect Michael, however, is nothing if not persistent and despite the fact Jacquie is clearly toying with him, he decides to ask repeat his question.\n18 towels Read More Woman's response to receiving unsolicited nude photo from male stranger gets HER banned from Facebook 19 towels down Surely most people by now would have given up and accepted the fact that Jacquie clearly REALLY loves towels.\nTo shake things up a bit, Jacquie introduces a bath robe.

Construction is set to begin in 2019 and expected to be completed by 2021, when another iconic arts venue, the Singapore Art Museum, will likewise reopen after its own revamp.\nSituated along the Esplanade Waterfront, the 3,000 sq m space will be integrated into the art centre\u2019s Annexe area, which comprises existing F&B outlets as well as the Annexe Studio, the revamped former Queen club that opened last year and serves as a venue for live music, immersive performances and rehearsals.\nThe project is estimated to cost around S$30 million, with the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) committing S$10 million to kickstart the effort. The Esplanade will be raising the remaining amount through various fundraising activities, which will include reaching out to the public.\n\u201cThe Esplanade has created shared experiences for Singaporeans from all walks of life, and has played a pivotal role in growing our performing arts scene over the past 14 years. It is truly a national arts centre that belongs to all Singaporeans and is loved by all. This new waterfront theatre will meet the needs of our theatre companies and community arts groups that often require a smaller venue to showcase their works,\u201d said MCCY Minister Grace Fu in a statement.\nThe new waterfront theatre will be situated behind the Esplanade's power house, as part of the arts centre's Annexe section. (Photo: The Esplanade) A 550-SEATER GAMECHANGER\nEsplanade chief executive officer Benson Puah described the addition of a mid-sized theatre as a \u201cgamechanger\u201d, which will bridge the gap between the arts centre\u2019s available performance venues.\nCurrently, it has the Concert Hall and Theatre, which seat 1,600 and 2,000 people, respectively. At the other end of the spectrum are the 240-seater Recital Hall and 220-seater Studio.\nA 550-seater space, which can be configured for various types of performances, will serve as an alternative option for local groups who want to go beyond intimate black box performances but may shy away from the bigger - and costlier - venues.\n\u201cHow much work can we bring to a 2,000-seat theatre? And how many local companies are interested to do work on that scale?\u201d said Puah.\n\u201cFor the artistic community, (the waterfront theatre) is a space that will give them opportunities to hone their craft. You can do four or five shows.\u201d\nEsplanade deputy CEO Yvonne Tham added that the new space will also allow them to programme more productions for young children and students, work more with community and traditional arts groups, and encourage collaborations between regional and Singapore artists, who often create shows more suitable for mid-sized theatres.\n\u201cWe hope to be able to present a greater diversity of works, and in terms of audiences, develop a wider taste,\u201d she said.\nWhen asked why the Esplanade has not considered using existing mid-sized venues such as the Drama Centre and the Victoria Theatre and Concert Hall, which it is managing before the Arts House Limited takes over in August, Puah said: \u201cThe remit was we will not programme shows in those spaces.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cWhen we were first appointed (as place managers), the arts community were very concerned that if we did so, we would crowd them out.\u201d\nThe arts centre's outdoor theatre venue draws crowds to the waterfront area. (Photo: The Esplanade) GETTING THE PUBLIC ON BOARD\nThe Esplanade will be putting out a call for design proposals later this year, but the idea is for the theatre space to be \u201ccasual, raw and porous\u201d, said Tham.\n\u201cLots of people walk by the waterfront everyday so it\u2019s a great opportunity for any member of the public to connect with it.\u201d\nWith the Esplanade\u2019s spiked domes already a signature look, and the fact that the new theatre will face the architectural flamboyance of Marina Bay Sands and ArtScience Museum, should people expect an unusual structure?\n\u201cIt will not be a designer building, we can\u2019t afford that,\u201d said Puah. \u201cBut being a performing arts centre, it will be tastefully done. It still has to fit in but it need not be expensively done.\u201d\nBudget is something that the Esplanade has had to compromise on since day one. In fact, the proposed waterfront theatre is actually a Plan B of sorts.\nWhen the Esplanade was first mooted in the 1990s, the original plan was to build a larger complex that included venues and studios of various sizes. The lack of budget meant that it had to be built in phases, the first of which resulted in the current S$600 million arts centre, which opened in 2002.\nA recent feasibility study revealed that it would be financially impossible to begin work at the moment on the second phase of development, which would cost around the same.\nSaid Puah: \u201cWe were meant to have all these spaces but the reality is, Phase 2 in today\u2019s context will be tough. The government understands the needs of the arts community but the reality of today is there are other national priorities. Now is not the time to lobby for a large chunk of our national budget, so we looked at the waterfront theatre in lieu of a full Phase 2.\u201d\nWith the need to raise S$20 million on the Esplanade\u2019s part, Puah admitted the decision to build a waterfront theatre is a \u201ccalculated risk\u201d.\n\u201cIt will be challenging but not undoable. And this is important enough for us to really get it done.\u201d\nCome 2021, there will be a new waterfront theatre on this site. (Photo: The Esplanade) The Esplanade will be announcing several new fundraising initiatives in October, when it officially celebrates its 15th anniversary. Aside from wooing corporate sponsors, it will actively reach out to the public, possibly through crowdfunding.\nCiting the enthusiastic public support for the defunct National Theatre, which included the \u201ca-dollar-a-brick\u201d campaign, Puah hopes people would also get behind the Esplanade\u2019s new theatre.\nAfter all, while it took a while for Singaporeans to warm up to the Durian at the start, it has since become a popular place, drawing to date 88 million visitors to thousands of performances.\n\u201cWhen we first started out, it wasn\u2019t easy to go out to ask for donations without demonstrating where our heart lies and how relevant we are to the community. I think we\u2019ve done enough to demonstrate that relationship to now go out and say, support us so we can do more,\u201d he said.\nAdded Tham: \u201cBecause it\u2019s a theatre that\u2019s for everyone, we will explore ways in which members of the public can be part of it. We really want this theatre to be something where people can say \u2018I helped build it\u2019.\u201d\n- CNA/mm\nEmail More", "entities": {"persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "tham"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "said puah"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "yvonne tham"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "puah"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "benson puah"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "grace fu"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "ministry of culture"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "esplanade waterfront"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "annexe studio"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "concert hall"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "singapore"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "artscience museum"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "singapore"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "marina bay sands"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "singapore art museum"}]}}, {"url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9tj.R1dPVNZVv.rsXKwrZaPZkyh6NGERv82cHtYTr3K4uHS0bqIn0qjiGQlXh5N1kA9q6fqs3WcJwNjdWsiMJClbBvfDf11mI-", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "title": "Everything We've Learned About Family Is From Vin Diesel in the 'Furious' Franchise", "rating": null, "thread": {"participants_count": 1, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9tj.R1dPVNZVv.rsXKwrZaPZkyh6NGERv82cHtYTr3K4uHS0bqIn0qjiGQlXh5N1kA9q6fqs3WcJwNjdWsiMJClbBvfDf11mI-", "domain_rank": 1649, "section_title": "Complex Pop Culture", "main_image": "//images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1,q_auto/ppslul6t0bffdgwaqaoo/family-dom-toretto", "replies_count": 0, "site": "complex.com", "site_categories": ["news", "media", "entertainment"], "title": "Everything We've Learned About Family Is From Vin Diesel in the 'Furious' Franchise", "country": "US", "site_full": "www.complex.com", "spam_score": 0.62, "performance_score": 9, "uuid": "1e673e2ff9278957f3622eebef7c0c7f24b5ac53", "title_full": "Everything We've Learned About Family Is From Vin Diesel in the 'Furious' Franchise | Complex", "published": "2017-04-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "site_type": "news", "social": {"pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "facebook": {"comments": 20, "shares": 939, "likes": 939}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "site_section": "http://assets.complex.com/feeds/channels/pop-culture.xml"}, "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fast_and_the_Furious#Box_office_performance", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SN53TQoohgE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bjqsWtO5Xjg", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVg5X7dUlLM", "http://fastandfurious.wikia.com/wiki/Kenny_Linder", "https://twitter.com/nicecoolfriend"], "highlightText": "", "author": "John Flynn", "uuid": "1e673e2ff9278957f3622eebef7c0c7f24b5ac53", "crawled": "2017-04-10T19:23:43.966+03:00", "ord_in_thread": 0, "text": "Everything We've Learned About Family Is From Vin Diesel in the 'Furious' Franchise By John Flynn John Flynn is nice, cool and friendly. Follow him on twitter @nicecoolfriend .\nApr 10, 2017 Share Tweet Image via Complex Original Vin Diesel\u2019s Dom Toretto is the boulder-shaped man upon which the Fast and Furious franchise has been built. After starting as a relatively straightforward series about driving cool cars at reckless speeds, the films\u2019 absurdity has increased along with their budget, leading to sequences like the team skydiving inside their vehicles or the Rock destroying a drone with an ambulance or Dom jumping a gold-plated, ruby-encrusted Lykan Hypersport between three Abu Dhabi skyscrapers.\nBut other than an excuse to string together stunts, the franchise is about a lovey-dovey, street-racing supercrew who only go after people worse than they are. In these films, Dom talks about his team as family a lot\u2014partially because a fair amount of his team is family, but also because it seems the unabashedly sentimental bonds between the drivers make them successful, both in their capers and in their films, which have grossed nearly $4 billion worldwide .\nBut before we get into Dom\u2019s distinctly hammy Quote: s, a little context. In 2001\u2019s T he Fast and The Furious , back when Dom was about 60 percent less thick, we learn how his father died:\n\u201cHe was coming up in the pro-stock circuit. Last race of the season, he was coming into the final turn when a driver named Kenny Linder tapped his bumper and put him into the wall at a hundred and twenty miles an hour. I watched my father burn to death. I can still remember him screaming. The people who were there said my father died long before the tanks blew. They said it was me that was screaming.\u201d\nA week later, Dom dealt with this by repeatedly bashing Linder\u2019s face with a wrench, leaving him a bulgy, bloody mess, robbing him of his ability to drive. Not the healthiest way to cope with a loss. The retaliation gets Dom banned from the professional racing circuit.\nSo he starts street-racing and hijacking trucks, which catches the attention of the LAPD. They send in undercover cop Brian O\u2019Connor (Paul Walker), who at first seeks to arrest Dom, but then decides he really likes Dom\u2019s sister, Mia, as well as driving cars illegally fast, sparking the beginning of that trio\u2019s bond and Dom\u2019s development into a family man.\nNow that you know where he\u2019s coming from, here\u2019s Dom\u2019s five best family Quote: s.\nNext Slide Watch Now Tags: Features , Lists , Fast And Furious , Movies , Vin Diesel , Fast 8", "entities": {"persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "john flynn jo"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "vin diesel"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kenny linder"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "linder"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "mia"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "flynn"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dom toretto"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "brian o\u2019connor"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dom"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "paul walker"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "lapd"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "complex original vin diesel"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "abu dhabi"}]}}, {"url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT7LPYakljWjybzhtyDBPCDfPICB7rIWDCKuxl1q2SAjDTExhG9Cyy4Fzt3HBI3IjZp2nWhjtWnQScy2qFN6bSYhmRAVv60E08-", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-10T16:27:12.608+03:00", "title": "What It's Really Like to Work in an Abattoir", "rating": null, "thread": {"participants_count": 1, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT7LPYakljWjybzhtyDBPCDfPICB7rIWDCKuxl1q2SAjDTExhG9Cyy4Fzt3HBI3IjZp2nWhjtWnQScy2qFN6bSYhmRAVv60E08-", "domain_rank": 173, "section_title": "vice", "main_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/58e76970d94c7915b5219f0a/lede/1491563857787-meat-640721_1920.jpeg?crop=1xw:0.8443xh;0xw,0.0782xh&resize=1200:*", "replies_count": 0, "site": "vice.com", "site_categories": ["news", "entertainment", "education"], "title": "What It's Really Like to Work in an Abattoir", "country": "US", "site_full": "www.vice.com", "spam_score": 0.0, "performance_score": 9, "uuid": "9ad6080d61aae44b28f8e311a8c5414a5d9e93dd", "title_full": "What It's Really Like to Work in an Abattoir - Vice", "published": "2017-04-10T16:27:12.608+03:00", "site_type": "news", "social": {"pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 995, "likes": 995}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "site_section": "http://www.vice.com/en_uk/rss"}, "language": "english", "external_links": [], "highlightText": "", "author": "Hannah Ewens", "uuid": "9ad6080d61aae44b28f8e311a8c5414a5d9e93dd", "crawled": "2017-04-10T16:27:12.608+03:00", "ord_in_thread": 0, "text": "(Top photo by Jai79, via Pixabay) \nAn account from 36-year-oldBrad, as told to Hannah Ewens. \nJust like a hospital has a distinctive smell, abattoirs smell like warm blood. There's iron in the air all the time even over the bleach you can still smell it.\nYou hear stories of people throwing up on their first day or freaking out and leaving straight away. But most know what they're getting into. These are rough jobs, so while they're all good, honest lads who work in abattoirs, they kill things for a living. You have to have a bit of a different mindset for it. I grew up in the Lake District so I was hunting my whole life and used to have my own farm where I'd butcher my own animals. It's an early start 4:30AM and anearly finish 2PM and that suits me.\nThere arealways two parts inside an abattoir: a clean side and a dirty side. Animals have to go through the dirty side first before you go into where it's going to be prepared for human consumption. The dirty side is where all the gutsand the hair and the skin's removed. It's a proper production line, really.\nFirst they get electric shocks. Cows used to be done with a bolt gun. It was basically like the end of a shotgun barrel and you'd put that on the forehead of the cow and then hit the top of it with a hammer and it would send a bolt slowly into its brain. Obviously they could see it happening and were scared shitless. It was quite horrible 20 years ago, but regulations in place at work now make it a lot better. You've got to keep an animal de-stressed, because there's nothing worse than a stressed animal before it's slaughtered. You ruin the meat, so it's worth nothing anyway. Now, they use the electrocution method, which is a lot more humane.\n\"When you'd fix the pig dehairer, because of all the fats,oils and bits of pig on it, as soon as you started welding somethingit'd turn into basically smelling like a rotten bacon sandwich.\"\nThen you slit and bleed them it usually takes four or five hours to bleeda cow or a pig, or something of that size. Then you've got all of this dirty stuff to do, which is quite a nasty process. You have to take all their innards out and throw it together as contaminated waste. So you have barrels of guts basically just hanging around. Next is the processing: de-skin, de-furring. Dice them up and bag them up. If they weren't doing human food say, cat or dog food then all the regulations change;everything speeds up and you could get away with a lot more. \nA lot of what I was doing was machinery repairs, which was gruesome. Some were huge band saws, which could cut a whole cow in half easily. I had to fix the pig dehairer often. Once the pig had been bledit was put into this cylinder-shaped machine that looked like the inside of a cheese grater but not quite as sharp. The pig was spun in it to take the fine hair off. So you'd have a pig that was bouncing around in this cylinder three to four feet in the air, as it was going round and obviously that's a lot of weight coming down, so it used to break quite regularly. When you'd fix it, because of all the fats and the oils and bits of pig that were on it, as soon as you started welding something and putting heat into itit'd turn into basically smelling like a rotten bacon sandwich. It was quite grim. Almost enough to put you off but not quite! \n\"Like any office there's banter and practical jokes. It's quite regular that someone will open their lunch box and find acow's tongue in there or something.\"\nTo be fair, the hygiene side of it is phenomenal. You literally can't get away with anything. Abattoirs are inspected so regularly it's mental. Most people don't realise you spend a lot of your day cleaning. \nIt all sounds awful, but like any office there's banter and practical jokes. It's quite regular that someone will open their lunch box and find a cow's tongue in there or something. \nThe darkest time was during the foot-and-mouth crisis in the early 2000s. So many lads lost their jobs,but lots of us were paid a ridiculously huge amount of money to go to the farms and help kill all the animals. You'd be killing 300 to400 cows a day, for weeks. I was a loader, so I'd load bodies onto the fire, which is the only way you could kill the disease. There were just piles and piles of burning bodies, big black acidic smoke and the smell of barbecue in the air. You had to keep going over to make sure the bodies were still burning. Most people couldn't cut it, crying, and had to leave. \nThat was when the bolt guns started coming out again because you just couldn't do it any other way at its height there were up to 50 new cases a day. Cows aren't stupid;they could hear the bangs going off, probably thinking, 'All my mates go through that curtain and then the bangs go off.' Some animals were deep into the foot-and-mouth symptoms. It attacks the nervous system, and the back legs are usually first to go, so they can hardly walk and are falling over.You had to almost pick them up to take them to get killed.\n\"We saved thousands of British farms but it was not the nicest situation for man or beast. I wouldn't want to live through itagain.\"\nThere was a human side to it, too, dealing with the farmers affected and their families. They were losing their entire stock of animals, literally going bankrupt overnight. I was going back round to my farm very worried about whether I had it on me what if I am carrying it home, bringing it into my area? \nWe saved thousands of British farms,but it wasn't the nicest situation for man or beast. It was a very hard time because you never really see death on that sort of scale, even if you're at an abattoir every single day. I wouldn't want to live through itagain.\nBut honestly? I find the whole process of the job quite a rewarding thing. You go out, you kill an animal, you butcher it, you eat it.It's not got all the chemicals and preservatives. The biggest problem is that people don't know where their food is from;they don't think about the process.Food is all too easy. None of them really know that milk and meat comes from a cow. They don't think of me, they don't think of my job in there.\n@hannahrosewens \nMore fromVICE: \nYour Job Is Pointless \nThe Isolating Life of a Railway Engineer \n10 Questions YouAlways Wanted to Ask a Gynaecologist", "entities": {"persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "hannah ewens"}], "organizations": [], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "pixabay"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "lake district"}]}}, {"url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_kNOYMWIthylTUGkFjTM60jqqdDuDF8RID7YNRMqCL56tj55KJPSMgaI69NGTxVFPAEyX1v9Gibd3WmhSl4u3NfMdpR5IAvBH7FItKx5ljW2VmWNg_DmFiKEk4ag.r4HzUQIRW1k_HbScvbPjO0KkCkdfGU_1kqLooJ22V07H60Os1ezPuVK1H4ylxW1QJM4kwIcXdL1fzBQ--", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-10T13:07:00.401+03:00", "title": "Great Barrier Reef: Second mass bleaching in 12 months devastates two thirds of coral", "rating": null, "thread": {"participants_count": 1, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_kNOYMWIthylTUGkFjTM60jqqdDuDF8RID7YNRMqCL56tj55KJPSMgaI69NGTxVFPAEyX1v9Gibd3WmhSl4u3NfMdpR5IAvBH7FItKx5ljW2VmWNg_DmFiKEk4ag.r4HzUQIRW1k_HbScvbPjO0KkCkdfGU_1kqLooJ22V07H60Os1ezPuVK1H4ylxW1QJM4kwIcXdL1fzBQ--", "domain_rank": 568, "section_title": "The Independent - News", "main_image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/10/10/coral-reef-bleaching.jpg", "replies_count": 0, "site": "independent.co.uk", "site_categories": ["news", "entertainment", "education"], "title": "Great Barrier Reef: Second mass bleaching in 12 months devastates two thirds of coral", "country": "GB", "site_full": "www.independent.co.uk", "spam_score": 0.0, "performance_score": 9, "uuid": "25e0759c0cb2485f56076ffbcd2b20846b726e77", "title_full": "Great Barrier Reef: Second mass bleaching in 12 months devastates two thirds of coral | The Independent", "published": "2017-04-10T13:07:00.401+03:00", "site_type": "news", "social": {"pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 944, "likes": 944}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "site_section": "http://www.independent.co.uk/news/rss"}, "language": "english", "external_links": [], "highlightText": "", "author": "Loulla-Mae Eleftheriou-Smith", "uuid": "25e0759c0cb2485f56076ffbcd2b20846b726e77", "crawled": "2017-04-10T13:07:00.401+03:00", "ord_in_thread": 0, "text": "Two thirds of Australia\u2019s Great Barrier Reef has been severely affected by two consecutive years of mass bleaching, according to new aerial surveys.\nBleaching is caused by abnormal environmental conditions, such as heightened sea temperatures, which causes coral to drive out the algae known as zooxanthallae that gives them colour, leaving the coral bleached and looking white.\nLast year mass bleaching left 35 per cent of the northern and central parts of the coral either dead or dying. It is possible for coral that has been bleached to recover if the algae can recolonize it, but it can take years and requires the water temperature to drop. This year\u2019s bleaching marks the fourth time the Great Barrier Reef has experienced severe bleaching since 1998, and the second mass bleaching that has happened in the space of 12 months. \nProfessor Terry Hughes and Dr James Kerry at the ARC Centre for Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University carried out the aerial surveys that covered more than 8,000km. This year, only the southern third of the reef has been left untouched. Mr Hughes claimed that while the reef is struggling with multiple impacts, such as the effects of Tropical Cyclone Debbie that recently hit the area or last year\u2019s El Nino, the record-breaking temperatures driven by global warming is the most pressing problem.\nSpeaking to The Guardian , Mr Hughes said there is concern over the frequency of bleaching of the reef when it takes around 10 years for some of the coral to recover from these events. \n\u201cThe significance of bleaching this year is that it\u2019s back to back, so there\u2019s been zero time for recovery,\u201d he said, adding that while it is too early to tell the extent of the damage that will be caused by this year\u2019s bleaching, the effects will be seen up to 500km south of the areas damaged last year.\nHe told the BBC this is the shortest gap that has been seen between mass bleaching. \u201cThe sooner we take action on global greenhouse gas emissions and transition away from fossil fuels to renewables, the better.\u201d\nRandi Rotjan, a marine biologist at Boston University in Massachusetts called the news \u201creally scary,\u201d and likened the bleaching to the reef \u201closing its insurance policy\u201d.\n\u201cThe scale of the devastation means its losing its potential to reseed the parts of the reef that were previously damaged,\u201d he told New Scientist .", "entities": {"persons":

He opposed military action in 2013 and campaigned on a platform of fixing problems in the US, not Syria.\nDuring the election campaign he expressed wariness that US military action in Syria might lead to conflict with Russia.\nAnd while viewing the airbase strike as decisive, most commentators are not seeing a radical change in the US approach to Syria.\nIs Trump slipping into Syria quagmire?\nTrump acts decisively in Syria: Now what?\nWhat are Syria and its allies saying?

This is a movie that knows how hot it is too, so if you were worried that there wouldn't be quite enough nudity then know that The Rock has got you covered. The Baywatch movie is guaranteeing two things: slow motion running and beautiful people taking their clothes off . Here's how much dirtier Baywatch will be from the original Baywatch TV show. \nWe worked hard to make sure the flesh quota was high, there's more gratuitous boobs, bums, abs, whatever per minute than you can imagine. Plot was important, don't get me wrong, but so was sorting out our slow motion runs. \nHmmm, I'm pretty sure that plot isn't too important a concern for this movie, but who's seeing this for the plot in the first place? \nOne of the key ways that the Baywatch movie will differ from the classic television show is that it will be an R-rated comedy. Baywatch is going for broke and turning the ridiculousness of the concept up a few pegs, leaning hard into its R-rating. Dwayne Johnson told The Sun that they did not hold back on the nudity, making sure that viewers would always have something to ogle at on-screen. Johnson also makes an illuminating comparison to the show, which was technically a family show on at a family time. \nDwayne Johnson, also known as the busiest man in Hollywood , has been working hard on his Baywatch movie, and can hardly fault him for being excited over it. The film takes the 21 Jump Street approach by adapting a typically serious but accidentally hilarious TV show and making it into a purposefully hilarious and self-aware movie. The trailers and marketing have done everything they can to sell the movie as this summer's big uproarious comedy , but we'll see how it all shakes down this May. \nWant to see a preview of some of that nudity-filled Baywatch ? Check out one of the trailers for the film below, though without the actual nudity, you'll have to buy a ticket to see that. \nBaywatch is directed by Seth Gordon and stars Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron , Alexandria Daddario, Kelly Rohrbach, Priyanka Chopra, and Jon Bass, with cameos from original series stars David Hasselhoff and Pamela Anderson. The film is expected to help kick off the summer on May 26, 2017.

While fans would prefer the singer continue her time at Planet Hollywood until the world ends, Spears will end her Las Vegas residency in December when her contract expires. Spears' \"Piece of Me\" show has been a staple in the city for four years, and it's become an extremely popular destination for visitors. The show sells out nearly every night, and tourists hit the musical event every time they're in Vegas. \nAccording to Vulture, Spears won't leave Las Vegas without fanfare. Her last show will be a blowout extravaganza on New Years Eve, and given the star's penchant for glitter, it's sure to do her time in the city of lights justice. Spears' manager Larry Rudolph spoke to the Las Vegas Review-Journal about the star's final performance, and her plans for the \"Piece of Me\" show moving forward. \u201cWe are done with this show, and our next move is undecided,\" Rudolph said in the interview. \"We are still talking with Caesars Entertainment and other interested parties in Las Vegas.\u201d Ethan Miller/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images \nIt's unclear whether or not Spears will continue to perform in Vegas in some capacity. Right now, she has a tour of Tel Aviv, Israel in the works, but in the interview with the Review-Journal , Rudolph evaded questions about Spears' future in Las Vegas. \"\u201cAnything is possible. We have made zero decisions,\u201d he told the publication. \u201cWe expect a lot of interest from all parties. Britney basically sells out every show, and she loves Las Vegas, she loves performing in Vegas, and Vegas is a possibility going forward.\u201d \nWhile Rudolph insisted that Vegas could certainly be in Spears' future, it's clear the star is pretty booked moving forward. This summer she'll tour in Japan and the Philippines as well as Israel, and there are rumors of another album in the works . With all the touring and potential future recordings, so it might be a while before she settles back down in Las Vegas for another run like the residency at Planet Hollywood. Fortunately, given the love the city has for the singer, Vegas fans aren't likely to hold it against the singer. \nWith Britney Spears' future in the city uncertain, those tickets are going to be a hot commodity. For those fans lucky enough to snag a seat, it will be a coveted chance to see the singer one more time.

As it got to about 9.25am, when the class was about to begin, I decided I was into the routine and I would just stick with it.\u201d Read More Horrifying pictures of little boy who was left with bleeding lump on his head after 'school bully pushed him into metal pole' \nVicki, whose partner Dave Parr, 35, is an investment banker, joined a gym after the birth of her youngest son Noah, now four. \nAs her fitness improved, she saw a post on Facebook about the fire service and decided to join up. Vicki had a four operation to have titanium rods placed in her back (Photo: PA Real Life) \nShe officially became a firefighter in January last year at Birchwood Fire station and as one of just 32 female firefighters in Cheshire, she has been working to encourage more women to join up. \nHer intense job meant she needed to stay fit and strong, so she went to the gym every day. \nOn this occasion, though, one of her regular routines went drastically wrong. \nVicki, also a mum to Luke, 10, said: \u201cI was doing step-ups on an aerobic step and I had a bar on the back of my neck, carrying 130kg, which is about 20 stone. Vicki with her children Noah and Luke, on holiday in Majorca last year (Photo: PA Real Life) \n\u201cI stepped up with my right leg and left leg and got straight back down, but I wobbled and because of the weight of the bar, I fell forwards rather than backwards. \n\u201cIt basically folded me in half. It\u2019s like leaning down and touching your toes and someone coming and shoving you that extra little bit further.\u201d \nThe bar rolled down Vicki\u2019s neck and over her head and she was flung backwards onto the floor, screaming in pain. \nShe added: \u201cThe next thing I remember is another gym goer next to me telling me to stay still. I kept trying to get up and they were telling me to stay where I was. \n\u201cIt felt like I\u2019d been laid on cold concrete for so long my body was numb. I didn\u2019t understand what I had done.\u201d Vicki Williams at the gym working out last autumn (Photo: PA Real Life) \nStaff called the paramedics and they arrived within 15 minutes and when they started to treat her, they realised how serious Vicki\u2019s injuries were \n\u201cThe paramedics came and said they needed to move my legs and when they did, I thought my feet were still on the floor, but they had moved me. I knew something was very wrong,\u201d Vicki said. \n\u201cThe only thing I could think of was that I wouldn\u2019t be able to go to a training weekend at fire college. I was really looking forward to it. It sounds ridiculous right now but I didn\u2019t even think I was never going to walk again.\u201d \nRushed to Aintree hospital, she was given strong painkillers, including ketamine, and taken straight for CT and MRI scans, to assess the damage to her back. \n\u201cThe surgeon told my family and that it was really bad. They said they needed to get me into surgery straight away,\u201d she explained. \nDuring a four-hour operation, doctors placed titanium rods in her back, but a dislocated bone had damaged her spinal cord. \nVicki remained in intensive care for 11 days, before being moved to a spinal ward. Vicki Griffith's colleagues at Birchwood Fire Station in Cheshire (Photo: PA Real Life) \nLast week, she was moved to Southport spinal injuries rehabilitation unit to continue her recovery. \nHer injuries mean she is unable to move from her belly button down and doctors are still assessing her and she is undergoing rehab but they believe it is unlikely she will be able to walk again. \nShe said: \u201cThings could change. Your body is still in shock for the first eight weeks. I will be tested again after the eight weeks and there is a slim chance that with intense physio and a lot of work, I may be able to walk. \nVicki and her partner, Dave, are in the process of buying their first home together and friends and family have set up a JustGiving page, to raise money to make adjustments for Vicki in their new home.

But we need to be able to make more long term adjustments at the new house, to make it more wheelchair-friendly, to help me get around.\u201d \nAnd she has set herself the target of May 28 to return to her rented house. \n\u201cI think it will take some work, but I am very determined. They had said the end of June but I think I can do it by the end of May. \n\u201cLuke has been staying with his dad who is helping him understand and my family have been great with helping to look after Noah. \n\u201cI have had so much support from everyone, especially my family and Dave, so I know I can get there.\u201d \nA spokesperson from LiveWire, who operate the gym at Birchwood, said: \u201cWe wish Victoria all the best in her recovery.\u201d \nTo donate to Vicki\u2019s page, visit https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/vicki-peers-3-peaks Like us on Facebook", "entities": {"persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "vicki"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "vicki williams"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "vicki griffith"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dave"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "noah"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "luke"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "victoria griffiths"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dave parr"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "pa real life"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "warrington"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "aintree university hospital"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "birchwood leisure"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "birchwood fire station"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "instagram"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "facebook"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "southport"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "majorca"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cheshire"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "birchwood"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "liverpool"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "aintree"}]}}, {"url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApv9JGiiuUOz5YtKRoW7uV9b9ZIRAq7dKUutsMJhc527nI7FBOxdUloWolOYELTeS4xluCRZKCCaSA--", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-09T13:02:48.346+03:00", "title": "\u0e44\u0e21\u0e48\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e14\u0e32!

This meant it would directly clash with Rajinikanth and Akshay Kumar\u2019s mega movie \u2013 2.0 . Diwalis have always been a date for a BIG release and over the past few years, we have seen some mighty clashes. And looks like we have another one on our hands this year. Though 2.0 and Secret Superstar cater to different sets of audience, the two will compete with each other courtesy the star power of each actor associated with the film. Rajinikanth is worshipped as a God down South, while Aamir is known to give some power-packed content, which drive in the collections. But the question on everyone\u2019s mind is \u2013 who will win this box office duel? So we decided to analyse the clash and tell you what we think about it. And from our reckoning, looks like both the films will have fantastic run at the box office. But obviously, 2.0 is going to be the big ticket movie which will rake in huge amounts of money. \nWhile the clash is being touted as the biggest yet, we don\u2019t feel that it will have any affect on either of the films. As trade anlayst, Akshaye Rathi (exhibitor and distributor), reasons, \u201cI really don\u2019t think that either of the film will affect each other. The kind of fan following that Rajinikanth has is unparalleled. In fact, the cream of the business for 2.0 is going to come from down South, while the cream of the business for Secret Superstar is going to come in from Northern and Western India, basically the Hindi-speaking belt. A good 50 per cent of the market of each film is very different from each other. And the bit that coincides, I am sure, if both the films are good, people will watch both of them. 2.0 is a compulsive watch down South and even up North, courtesy the presence of Akshay Kumar , it will have a tremendous run. I see no reason why it should not make Rs 100 crore in the Hindi market alone, thanks to Akshay\u2019s presence and what the film is touted to be. Secret Superstar , by the looks of it, is a niche film. The audience base is different, the geographical areas that they target are also different, so I am sure both 2.0 and Secret Superstar will do well.\u201d (ALSO READ \u2013 Biggest box office clash alert! Aamir Khan to take on Rajinikanth this Diwali ) \nHowever, it is 2.0 which will perform better at the box office, considering the fact that it will have a wider release. But, with a bigger budget, there will be pressure on the makers to recover their money too. As Akshaye adds, \u201cThe big ticket money is riding on 2.0 considering the huge budget. The overall spend on the film, including the cost of production plus other stuff, is more than five times of what the makers of Secret Superstar spent. So the revenues has to be in that ratio for the film to be able to make money. Let\u2019s see what happens. Secret Superstar has a significant role by Aamir Khan, but it is actually an extended cameo. So it is not an Aamir Khan film, but a film which will also feature Aamir. Similar to what Dear Zindagi was for Shah Rukh Khan . So don\u2019t expect huge numbers. It is actually a film that will grow with a good word-of-mouth publicity, if it manages to garner some. Anyway, to conclude, both films look interesting and it is a great period of release (Diwali), so I am sure both the films will do exceedingly well.\u201d \nTalking about the expected collections from both the movies, Akshaye predicts, \u201c 2.0 will make significantly more than Rs 300 crore at the box office from all the versions (Tamil, Hindi and others) in India itself. The overseas will be different. It\u2019s a bit premature to talk about Secret Superstar without seeing the trailers and promos.\u201d (ALSO READ \u2013 Whaaat?

But there was one possible \u201cgotcha\u201d that Go devotees could hold onto: Lee Se-dol was once, but is no longer, quite considered the greatest player on the planet.\nThat distinction is now considered to belong to Ke Jie, a 19-year-old Chinese player ranked number 1 worldwide. A professional since the age of ten, Ke has beaten Lee several times in high-profile matches in recent years, including three finals victories in the three months leading up to Lee\u2019s AlphaGo match. And next month, Ke will get his own showdown with DeepMind's AI.\nAt the Future of Go Summit in Wuzhen, China, Ke will face off against AlphaGo in a three-game match. Another game will see five of China\u2019s top pros attempt to team up to take down AlphaGo, while another will see a pro-vs-pro match where each player alternates turns with an AlphaGo teammate. \nAfter its comprehensive victory over Lee, AlphaGo will be the favorite for the match with Ke, who recently lost a few unofficial online games against the AI. But whatever happens, the wider variety of game formats this time will give some fascinating insights into how the AI performs in different situations. How will it react to taking on multiple play styles at once, or having every other move made by a human incapable of plotting the same strategy? And what will humans be able to learn about their own capabilities?\n\u201cArtificial intelligence has actually made human players stronger and more creative.\u201d \u201cInstead of diminishing the game, as some feared, artificial intelligence has actually made human players stronger and more creative,\u201d DeepMind CEO and co-founder Demis Hassabis says. \u201cIt\u2019s humbling to see how pros and amateurs alike, who have pored over every detail of AlphaGo\u2019s innovative game play, have actually learned new knowledge and strategies about perhaps the most studied and contemplated game in history. Clearly, there remains much more to learn from this partnership between Go\u2019s best human players and its most creative A.I. competitor.\u201c\nThe Future of Go Summit is a collaboration between Google, the China Go Association, and the Chinese government, and will also include a forum on the future of artificial intelligence that we can likely expect Google to use as an opportunity to check in on the technology\u2019s progress.

They are getting on and doing that.\" \nMr Boleat also said it was important the UK reached an early agreement over the terms of its exit from the bloc and on the rights of EU nationals. \nThat would minimise disruption to \"business and consumers in this country - and in Europe,\" he said. \nOn Friday, the Bank of England governor warned of sector-wide consequences if the UK left without a trade deal, but was optimistic for an agreement. \nMark Carney said the \"vast majority\" of City firms already had contingency plans in place. \nHowever, he said some financial firms still needed to prepare in case of a \"more extreme\" outcome. \nThe Bank has written to the UK's biggest financial firms, urging them to plan for \"all eventualities\" from the UK leaving the bloc.

By Aarti Iyengar | Updated: April 10, 2017 7:59 pm PHOTOS: Tiger Shroff takes rumoured girlfriend Disha Patani on a dinner date \nTiger Shroff\u2019s last venture, A Flying Jatt may not have touched hearts of adults but it definitely struck a chord with the young fans! The actor, who is known to have a bigger fanbase among fans, proves why that\u2019s the case. We got out hands on this making video of an ad for Sony YAY! for which the actor just got roped in as the brand ambassador. In the video, we see Tiger and the kids have a gala time. In the video, Tiger is seen shaking hands with a young boy but soon pranks him as he takes the same hand and scratches his butt. And then obviously, there were those moments where he flaunted his flexible moves by somersaulting in the air. But that\u2019s just the making. We\u2019re expecting to see a lot more from him in the ad, as and when it is out. \nWhat we noticed here was how he was totally chill with the kids. It all seemed very natural as he instantly created a rapport with the kids. Plus, his dance moves and pranks surely made the young lads all the more excited to share the frame with him. The channel is smart to have roped in Shroff as their brand\u2019s face. Considering how easily he is able to gel with the kids, its not a surprise that the brand decided to bring him in. Leena Lele Dutta, Business Head, SPN Kids Genre had earlier quoted, \u201cWe are excited to have Tiger Shroff as Sony YAY!\u2019s brand ambassador. Kids, across the country, relate to him and consider Tiger as their icon. Given his affinity with kids, we could not have found a better representative for our channel\u201d.
