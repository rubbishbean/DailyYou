Informal egg roll parties were recorded at the White House during the early Lincoln administration.\nDuring the post-Civil War years, the Easter egg games were played on the grounds surrounding the U.S. Capitol Building. In 1876, an act of Congress outlawed the Capitol grounds and terraces from being used as playgrounds to protect the property from destruction. In 1878, President Rutherford B. Hayes officially opened the White House grounds to local children for egg rolling on Easter Monday.\nDuring World War I and II, the events were canceled. Dwight D. Eisenhower and First Lady Mamie Eisenhower revived the event in 1953 after a 12-year absence. In 1969, Pat Nixon's staff introduced the White House Easter Bunny, a staffer dressed in a white fleece bunny costume who roamed the grounds and welcomed the egg rollers and posed for photographs. By 1974 the activities evolved into organized egg-rolling races. The 1981 eggstravaganza included assorted clowns and characters, balloon vendors, Broadway show vignettes, a petting zoo, exhibits of antique cars, and an eggxposition of specially decorated eggs (one for each state). Each egg roller received a goody bag filled with a program, toy products supplied by corporate sponsors, and food- whose wrappers littered the lawn. Since 1987 the event's theme has been inscripted on each egg, and by 1989 George and Barbara Bush added their facsimile signatures. Today the official eggs are given one to a child (under 12) as they leave the South Lawn.\nRead More About Easter in Washington, DC\nRelated Articles Washington, DC's 2017 Major Annual Events Celebrating Easter in Washington, DC Easter in the United States Explore the White House Gardens on a Public Tour Fun Easter Egg Hunts Near Washington, DC Learn About Washington DC's Pro Sports Teams Our Expert Recommends Spring Family Fun in the DC Area 15 Best Places to Go with Kids in the DC Area Top 10 Things to Do in the DC Area Easter Brunch in Washington, DC Spring Break in Washington, DC National Cherry Blossom Festival Best Museums for Kids in Washington DC April Festivals and Events in Washington DC May Festivals and Events in Washington DC Washington, Holidays/Seasonal Events White House Easter Egg Roll 2017: Tickets, Talent & More ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/+aboutdotcom", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/oYzpiARhtxGpQeyrSaU7ax2jwAQ=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/ParkHyattStKitts-58b2e7d45f9b5860466bac6c.jpg", "https://www.pinterest.com/aboutcomtravel/", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/tc9olltZDWIsnC-lpqpHGdcIjOs=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/capitol-building-170402241-58ddb7bf5f9b58468374c174.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/dos5cAktIxswAe8PhAgGW-BdTG0=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/GettyImages-124846685-589394d65f9b5874ee0312d4.jpg", "https://twitter.com/abouttravel", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/XIxTHATVZBzII49_HCZ3uCOW8KE=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/GettyImages-580470451-58b6e55b5f9b58604653eb93.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/gUX0Ao8BKEZApmnFRPG1vqpmBIQ=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/GettyImages-154917476-58b4b0e25f9b5860466f84fb.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/ZiY_kfxwIggjWClkBSXr9ztiwm4=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/GettyImages-148636845-58c2e1fa3df78c353c0c3cdd.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/hqNB_4tRQ2YBIW_e3MxKo5aWMDA=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/Cherry-Blossoms-56a239785f9b58b7d0c80d7a.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/QzeTKXfwH7Sgu3HurED0Aj4EKNM=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/DC-58e3adf23df78c5162fea85a.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/sO6iA4Dph60kcoPv90bMWjaGBiM=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/family-fun-56a239723df78cf772736c6f.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/aboutdotcomtravel", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/RCTKIMw-ogHb-i_rm4-GbKmaMQk=/385x0/filters:no_upscale()/about/White-House-Easter-56a236bf5f9b58b7d0c7f711.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/1if2aEpRLtZ26xItzN7O22tleQ0=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/kids-family.bmp-56a239533df78cf772736b33.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/stCpuzs7mVILFS9xc5p2ltdUfqs=/640x0/filters:no_upscale()/about/White-House-Easter-56a236bf5f9b58b7d0c7f711.jpg"], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-20T03:12:12.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "7cdf867606a6fef25dbd8bbfba0eed91ade5119f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qcW6.peZm_Q6zEgk3jHcvTIr8WYcNro8Gm4dduOOYgLsVX5bn1g8iR1TKdkZ1pIkhOw8G5EnE3IyNXiYN_rMl5A-", "site_full": "www.bbc.com", "site": "bbc.com", "site_section": "http://news.ycombinator.com/rss", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Hacker News", "title": "What a stranger taught me about Japan", "title_full": "What a stranger taught me about Japan", "published": "2017-04-21T00:25:09.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/live/624_351/images/live/p0/50/3m/p0503mj1.jpg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 130, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 980, "comments": 0, "shares": 980}, "gplus": {"shares": 3}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 16}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "7cdf867606a6fef25dbd8bbfba0eed91ade5119f", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_Lw5DuKD76qcW6.peZm_Q6zEgk3jHcvTIr8WYcNro8Gm4dduOOYgLsVX5bn1g8iR1TKdkZ1pIkhOw8G5EnE3IyNXiYN_rMl5A-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-04-21T00:25:09.000+03:00", "title": "What a stranger taught me about Japan", "text": "Japan The mysterious man who gave me Japan Travel writer Pico Iyer meets a human haiku, who shows him the living, seldom-seen heart of traditional Japan. By Pico Iyer 20 April 2017 \nAn elegant middle-aged man, in a spotless black jacket, came up to me, hand extended, to say hello, and I was startled. My neighbours in Japan tend to be formal and reticent; few of them are eager to take the initiative. And we were simply standing around an art gallery on Kitayama Street in northern Kyoto, 20 years ago, where a handful of us had gathered to see an exhibition of a friend\u2019s pen-and-ink drawings. In the classical sumi-e style, they were deliberately sketchy and full of emptiness; the heart of the paintings was the negative space at their centre, which every viewer could fill in according to his whim or choice. View image of Iyer met the mysterious man in an art gallery in Kyoto 20 years ago (Credit: Chinnaphong Mungsiri/Getty) \nOne of the blessings of a writer\u2019s life is that so many people are keen to tell you their story. But in this case, the more the intriguing stranger shared \u2013 in a calm and fluent English \u2013 the less I could be sure of. He had been born, he soon began telling me, in Shanghai in the 1930s, and when he sailed out of the exploding city as a boy, it was to land in a Japan that was equally desperate and broken. In his late teens, he had fallen in love with the daughter of the chairman of one of the most celebrated companies in Japan and followed her all the way to New York City. But soon her sense of duty and her role claimed her again, and he had to leave Fifth Avenue, alone. \nOne of the blessings of a writer\u2019s life is that so many people are keen to tell you their story. \nBefore much longer, he was on the West Coast, at art school, he said, just as the Summer of Love was coming to a climax. I didn\u2019t know quite what to make of any of this \u2013 there was no mention of a family, a home where he lived now, anything resembling a job \u2013 but I wasn\u2019t surprised when a common friend told me that Shinsuke was a classical archer: He carried himself with the straight-backed clarity of a traditional master. \nOur conversation ended, and I didn\u2019t see Shinsuke for many years. But when my wife and I got married, two years after that chance encounter in the art gallery, suddenly a huge, Rothko-worthy colour field painting \u2013 one enigmatic red square, one enigmatic black one \u2013 arrived on our doorstep. Shinsuke, whom I\u2019d met just once, had heard of our union and wanted to honour it, and he did so with the most arresting wedding present we were to receive. View image of Shinsuke wrote letters to Iyer for the rest of his life (Credit: Chiara Salvadori/Getty) \nMany years on, the phone rang in our generally quiet apartment. \u201cI do hope I\u2019m not disturbing you,\u201d said a deep voice, not quite Japanese, and not quite not, \u201cbut I am coming to Nara, and I wonder if you might have an hour free?\u201d When I arrived at the station, Shinsuke was seated in a caf\u00e9, with a book, in a beret, looking every inch the artist in Paris that, I was now to learn, he had been for many years. \nThe beauty of a haiku is that it doesn\u2019t have to spell much out. \nWe walked among the 1,200 wild deer who govern central Nara, about 45km south of Kyoto, and my new friend, always courteous and quiet, opened himself up again in a few bold, intimate strokes. He came from a samurai family, he said, and his father always took great pains not to show emotion. Even at his death, he\u2019d told his son nothing. He himself, Shinsuke continued, had a deep interest in shamanism and would be happy to introduce me to an old female mystic who was a distant member of the imperial family. When we parted, he handed me a card that contained just his name and that of the small island outside Tokyo on which he lived \u2013 with, he said, a beautiful young woman he took strange pains to refer to as his \u2018adopted daughter\u2019. \nIn any other circumstance, I\u2019d have been sceptical: The more savoury the details a writer hears, the more he\u2019s likely to be on alert. Mystification is the opposite of real mystery. But my friends who knew Shinsuke well assured me that none of his story was false; like most Japanese people, especially of his refined background, he was not given to exaggeration or self-promotion. View image of Iyer: \"I learned a little more about a culture in which the truest sign of intimacy is not needing to say a thing\u201d (Credit: Credit: Glowimages/Getty) \nMore years passed, and I heard that my mysterious friend had been airlifted out of his island after what sounded like a heart attack. But he kept on, as he\u2019d graciously requested my permission to do, sending me letters, written in a calligraphic hand that covered barely two suggestive sentences on each small rectangle of paper, as if this son of a samurai were eager not to make the same mistake as his self-enclosed father. \nAnd then one day there came a call and a courteous apology: Shinsuke was back in Nara, this time with a young woman he was to introduce as his best friend\u2019s daughter. But the woman called him her \u2018guru\u2019 and they looked far closer than any college girl and elderly honorary godfather might be expected to be. As we sat in a dark, near-silent restaurant \u2013 all partitions and soft lanterns \u2013 Shinsuke abruptly stood up and stole away. \nWhen he came back, the bill was paid. \u201cI just sold a painting,\u201d he insisted, \u201cand I want to give you something in return.\u201d For what, I wondered? All he would say was that he\u2019d read an old book of mine on Japan, twice, and wanted to repay the debt. View image of Iyer: \"[Shinsuke] whispers inside me as few of the Japanese among whom I\u2019ve lived for almost 30 years ever do\" (Credit: Credit: Artem Vorobiev/Getty) \nMy years in Japan went on, and I learned a little more about a culture in which the truest sign of intimacy is not needing to say a thing. The beauty of a haiku is that it doesn\u2019t have to spell much out. \nThen I received a call again, and it was that confident but unpresuming voice, apologising for the disturbance. \n\u201cHow are you?\u201d I said. \n\u201cI\u2019m dead,\u201d Shinsuke replied. \nHe heard the pause at the other end and chuckled. \n\u201cI mean, I died last week. I stopped breathing; they thought I was gone. But then they pumped me full of drugs, and now I\u2019m okay. Not myself; not in your world. I\u2019m having some quite interesting visions.\u201d \nThat didn\u2019t give me much to say in return, but Shinsuke had always had the gift of carrying himself as if in a parallel universe. \n\u201cTake care,\u201d I said, after we chatted for a while. \u201cAnd please give me a call as soon as you\u2019re out of the hospital.\u201d View image of Iyer: \u201cShinsuke had given me the most startling post-wedding present I ever received: the living, seldom-seen (Credit: Credit: Drazen_/Getty) \nBut the next call I got, one week later, reported that Shinsuke, apparently a well-known painter as renowned for his elegance as for his mastery of both Eastern and Western forms, was dead. \nMy friend, a human haiku, always told me just enough to remind me of all I didn\u2019t and could never know. \nNow, some years later, he whispers inside me as few of the Japanese among whom I\u2019ve lived for almost 30 years ever do \u2013 in part because our every meeting came out of nowhere, except what seemed like the imagination; and in part because my friend, a human haiku, always told me just enough to remind me of all I didn\u2019t and could never know. It took me a long time to realize that Shinsuke had given me the most startling post-wedding present I ever received: the living, seldom-seen heart of traditional Japan. \nPico Iyer is the author of 12 books, including most recently The Art of Stillness and The Man Within My Head . \n  called \"If   Week\".

Michelle Williams is in the cast so I knew movie was going to be depressing. But wow-this movie is a bitter cup of tea that has steeped too long and grown cold. And Williams is nominated for Best Supporting Actress! OY ! She gives us 10 minutes of her whiny, crying, depression...which is all she ever does...and that gets her a nom. Sigh. There were far too many other contenders....Critics rave over Afflecks performance of a man processing grief. While his performance is convincing, movie took forever and a day to reveal why. So when the big reveal arrives, I was exhausted. And you know what? Affleck looks exhausted throughout the entire movie. Just let the guy act, already. This movie could have been filmed in any city and called anything. However, in order to tie in the pompous title, the director had to drag us past every scenic point in the city of Manchester, thus prolonging the reveal even more. Yawn. The critics gave this movie such high praises, which makes me think the Manchester Commerce is paying them off. While this movie is not my cup of tea, I am taking it a step further against the Oscars by saying I do not recommend this movie. Depressing... by SPetche If you want to watch something to make yourself depressed then this is your movie. Basically a movie about how a bunch of horrible stuff happens to one person and absolutely nothing is resolved by the time the credits roll. The flashback editing is absolutely jarring and terrible as well. Loved Margaret and You Can Count On Me by ponte vecchio This one is so self-serious, I got fatigued. You could tell it was written for Matt Damon. The gay men at the bar are staring at him. The single mom is crushing on him. Very male adolescent fantasy in terms of the brooding antihero that some people are still attracted to even though he's bad news. He has a hair trigger temper and gets in bar fights... and you know how it goes.

You pride yourself on being light hearted, funny, and able to chat with anyone about anything, so you hop from group to group and have a wide circle of acquaintances. You grow through communication and prefer talking through ideas at work than sticking to a regimen. You may often dwell a little too much on the importance of having everyone so despite your active and fulfilling social life, you feel like you so you can really only be yourself around a small group of people. You got: Your most dominant trait is your kindness! \nYou always try to think of other people\u2019s feelings before speaking and you go above and beyond to do favours for your loved ones. People may mistake your sincerity for being a pushover, but you actually have a sharp eye and you know when someone is trying to take advantage of you. You do, however, have a tendency to put others\u2019 needs before your own and it\u2019s important that you take the time to do things for yourself every once in awhile. You got: Your most dominant trait is your introversion! \nBeing an introvert is by far your most dominant trait, showcasing itself in many aspects of your life. It allows you to spend time enjoying your own company, be self aware, and makes you a strong judge of character. You do often wish you were more sociable but you wouldn\u2019t actually want to give up your down time, and your close group of friends is all you really need when you do want to spend time with others. You got: Your most dominant trait is your meticulousness! \nYou have a tendency to plan every little aspect of your life and you feel uncomfortable beginning a project without planning out each step of the process and noting down solutions for any obstacle you may face. This enables you to achieve great success in your career and makes you a great leader for social groups, but often causes unnecessary stress when unforeseen challenges inevitably appear. You sometimes wish you could be a little more carefree, but you treasure the triumphs your organisation has allowed you to accomplish. You got: Your most dominant trait is your competitiveness! \nYou\u2019re led primarily by your assertive competitive streak that has rewarded you with great successes. You tend to compare yourself to others and often measure your happiness in academic, material, and social rankings. This has actually allowed you to be good at pretty much everything you do and although you thrive in the fun of competition, you sometimes wish you took it less seriously so you could focus more on the camaraderie than simply on winning. You got: Your most dominant trait is your passion! \nYou make decisions based predominantly on emotion and your intuition.

A fulfillment centre is basically what Amazon calls the big ol' warehouse it uses to store and ship products. There's been no decision on which city headquarters will be in, according to Fairfax. \nA country manager will also be hired, as well as hundreds of other employees to flesh out the Aussie expansion. \nAustralians have already been able to use an Australian Kindle store on the Amazon website, which launched in 2012, and there are already almost 1000 employees in the country. \n\"The next step is to bring a retail offering to Australia and we are making those plans now,\" Amazon said in a statement. \nAmazon's retail expansion will come as good news to small business owners, while existing, larger retailers will no doubt be worried by the online marketplace's effect here. Macy's, Walmart and larger stores across America have all closed hundreds of stores in the wake of Amazon's (and other online outlets') domination of the retail industry.

April 18, 2017 at 09:41AM By The Lafayette , writer at creators.co 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' [Credit: Disney / Lucasfilm] By The Lafayette , writer at Creators.co I'm an Entertainment Journalist and novelist, I love Star Wars and anything Superhero related! (Secretly also an Agent of Shield) \nWith the recent release of the teaser trailer for Star Wars: The Last Jedi , there has been a lot of conversation about the concept of \u201cGray Jedi.\u201d This was perpetrated by the following quote in the trailer: \nLuke Skywalker: \"Breath. Just breath. Now, reach out. What do you see?\" \nRey: \"Light. Darkness. A balance.\" Ultimate Guide To 'Star Wars 8: The Last Jedi': News, Trailer, Cast & All You Need To Know \nThis quote seems to indicate that there is much more to The Force then just the Jedi and Sith. Moreover, the two opposing orders may be just the tip of a very large iceberg regarding The Force and its place in the universe. With the mention of balance between the light and darkness in the trailer, many began to wonder if #Disney was bringing in the controversial Gray Jedi. \nThe idea of the Gray Jedi is very prolific in the old Expanded Universe and in the MMO, The Old Republic, which may or may not be in the new canon. Much of the idea of balance \u2014 which is being discussed in the new #StarWars canon under Disney \u2014 has its roots in the philosophy of the Gray Jedi. So, for those who are unfamiliar with the concept here is EVERYTHING you need to know about Gray Jedi. Gray Jedi Is Not A Title 'Star Wars: The Phantom Menace' [Credit: Lucasfilm] \nGray Jedi is not a title for a Jedi knight but rather a description of how they use The Force. Typically, it is used to describe a Jedi that dabbles in both the light and dark side of the force. Gray Jedi call on the dark side of the Force, but are not corrupted by it and do not embrace it entirely. A good example of this is Mace Windu, a Jedi who uses the dark side when in combat but abandons it when the battle is finished. Though it is debated, many have called Qui-Gon Jinn a Gray due to his dabbling in immortality. In fact, Tyvokka once said: \n\"Jinn always does things his own way, always sure he is right, always incredulous if we do not see it his way. Some think he is a Gray Jedi.\" A Gray Jedi Is Still A Jedi 'Star Wars: The Phantom Menace' [Credit: Lucasfilm] \nGray Jedi are not another order like the Sith, they are Jedi who embrace both views of the force and use both dark and light to their advantage. To a Gray Jedi the Force is just the Force; it is the individual that creates the dark side and the light side. In the acclaimed game, Knights of the Old Republic II , Gray Jedi are described as such: \nGray Jedi are those who, though having completed the teachings of the Jedi, operate independently and outside of the Jedi Council. They are typically seen as misguided, though they have not necessarily succumbed to the dark side. Their Use Of The Force 'Star Wars: The Clone Wars' [Credit: Lucasfilm] \nAll Gray Jedi display the use of both light and dark side Force abilities, and demonstrate skill in techniques common to both Jedi and Sith. These included: Force choke, Force lightning, healing, mind tricks, controlling animals and Force throws. While Gray Jedi do not adhere solely to the light side of The Force, they are free from the malevolent influences of the dark side. It is important to distinguish that Jedi who have suffered any corruption from the dark side \u2014 even if they are redeemed \u2014 are not considered to be #GrayJedi . Examples Of Gray Jedi 'Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith' [Credit: Lucasfilm] \nThe Imperial Knights: These were an order of Force practitioners loyal to the Emperor of the Fel Empire. They used the force in combat and leaned towards the light side. The Jedi council tolerated them and viewed them as Gray. \nMace Windu: Mace used a form of lightsaber combat known as Vaapad. It was a form that channeled the dark side in allowing the user to feel the thrill of battle and victory. Windu was the only user to not fall to the dark side of The Force. \nQui-Gon Jinn: It is up for debate if Jinn was truly considered a Gray Jedi. He was at odds with the council for many years and was known to study arts that were frowned upon by the Jedi (such as the path to immortality). \nJolee Bindo: A self-described Gray Jedi, Bindo separated himself from the Jedi council and operated as a smuggler and ally of the former Jedi and Sith Lord Revan. What Does This All Mean? \nThe Gray Jedi sought to expand the understanding of The Force and how it operates. The order was created to show that just because someone was a Jedi or Sith did not make them fully evil or good. It began to show that the Jedi were not all white knights and the Sith were not always the black hats. While much of this information is found in the old canon, Lucasfilm has been converting much of the old Expanded Universe into the new canon. Much of the philosophy of the force found in Star Wars Rebels and in the Force Awakens is from the old canon. \nDo you think that Gray Jedi are coming to the film universe?

The question of the day was how to regulate the people who move weed around the state, and it didn\u2019t take long for a theme to emerge. \n\u201cI talk to my law enforcement guys, and they say, 'We need to be able to tell the good guys from the bad guys.' And to me, that's what this is about,\u201d said George Runner, the vice chair of the BOE. \n\u201cWe can pass whatever regulation we want or don\u2019t want to, but that won\u2019t stop the trafficking, so if you want your industry, help us keep the bad guys out,\u201d said Diane Harkey, another member of the BOE. \n\u201cDespite the best efforts by a lot of people that are here today to do this in a legitimate manner, there still are quite a few people out there who are, for lack of a better term, drug dealers,\u201d said Capt. Kevin Davis, of the California Highway Patrol. \nThe Distributor crossed his arms over his chest. He couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that, considering there were no rules governing how cannabis should be moved around the state, the distinction between \u201cgood guy\u201d and \u201cbad guy\u201d had more to do with skin color than with an ability to follow the law. \nThen, a pugnacious man in high-waisted jeans strode down the center aisle. It was Barry Broad, the influential Teamsters lobbyist. The tone grew tense. Addressing someone who complained about the cost of following federal regulations for commercial drivers, Broad said, \u201cYou don\u2019t want people\u2019s loads hijacked, driving around the middle of the night \u2026 These drivers, they\u2019re not going to be people who smoke marijuana.\u201d \nOnce he was a few blocks away, the Distributor let his calm facade drop. \n\u201cOh my god, are they serious?\u201d he said. \u201cAre those Teamster union for real serious? Like, they want a piece of this? Everybody want a part of this. Regulation, regulation, regulation, and more regulation, huh?\u201d \nHe shook his head, overwhelmed, and lit a joint. He had come so far, and yet it would be at least two years before he could say he ran a legal business. He had so much left to do. \nThe Distributor got back in his car and drove a few more hours north. As soon as he got off the freeway, he was in pot country. Trails wove in and out of the base of the mountains. He took a side road, then another, and another. Finally he slowed down and pulled onto his supplier\u2019s property, down what appeared to be a normal driveway but soon turned into a winding, slushy dirt road he shifted into manual to navigate. Up and down, around and around, over creeks and under sycamore trees and through gates, skidding past pickup trucks and luxury sedans and a collapsed shack. Half an hour later, he came to a clearing on a hilltop with a small hut surrounded by pine, oak, and piles of trash. \nTwo blonde children were playing in the trees. Weed was hanging from clotheslines, scattered on the ground, sitting out on card tables, heaped in plastic bags. \n\"Where\u2019s your dad?\u201d the Distributor said. The older child, a girl, hopped down from the branches, leading him to where her father, a white man in his thirties, was using a chainsaw to break up a fallen tree. The Supplier wore a dirty T-shirt and smelled like he didn\u2019t believe in showers. Like many of the estimated 60,000 cannabis farmers living in Northern California's Humboldt, Mendocino and Trinity Counties, his parents were homesteaders who chased the dream of a simpler life into the mountains in the late 1970s. \n\u201cI\u2019ve been around pot for my whole life pretty much,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have our kids around it, and as far as what\u2019s going on around here right now, I mean, the herb is super primo, and I think it\u2019s, like, consistent and good in the market, but it\u2019s not my best.\u201d \nTwo mastiffs followed him back to the hut, patrolling a maze of black buckets, overturned mattresses, camping chairs, coolers, and other garbage. A few steps behind, the daughter said that she does a lot to help out. It\u2019s her job to turn the generator on every night. A hundred feet away there was a trampoline, the kind surrounded by a wall of mesh, covered in sleeping bags. \nThe Supplier walked off to get something to smoke, and the Distributor quietly said, \u201cIf the blacks have their kids working in the marijuana industry from that type of age, you know what type of condemnation would come down on them?\u201d He pursed his lips. \"My kids, they never see me smoke. They never see me with money or marijuana.\" \nThe Supplier came back with two kinds of pot, and the Distributor started rolling a joint. \u201cYeah, I went to Sacramento, went to this meeting, talking about transportation. How we gonna move this marijuana, how they gonna regulate it,\u201d he said. \nThe Supplier was unimpressed. The Distributor had made an attempt to explain the new laws to him, but he had no interest in getting a license, which means the Distributor will ultimately need to stop working with him. He likes and trusts the Distributor, though, and often goes to other farms to pick up a variety of product for him. \"If you\u2019re black, and you go up to Humboldt, it\u2019s just not a good idea,\u201d the Supplier said. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of a Gestapo sort of vibe with the corrupt local sheriff\u2019s departments. That\u2019s just the way it is, for fucking ever.\" \nNearby, a Latino guy wearing a leather tool belt snipped the leaves and stems off branches of cannabis with small scissors. He was a trimmer, part of a temporary underclass of vagrants and nomads who drift into town at the end of each summer looking to get high and prune pot for $20 an hour. Cannabis farmers tend to look down on trimmers. Most get treated like shit. \nSpotting the lit joint, the Trimmer walked over. \n\u201cHow is it?\u201d he asked. \u201cNot there?\" \n\u201cIt really sticky,\u201d the Distributor said, passing it to him. \"Let\u2019s roll a bigger one.\" \n\u201cI\u2019ll see what I can find,\u201d the Supplier said, walking off. He came back with a freshly picked bud. The Distributor brought it to his nose, inhaled, and then picked up another pair of scissors to remove the leaves. \n\u201cHow you think about me trimming?\u201d he asked the Trimmer, smiling. \n\u201cI don't want to sound racist, but you fit the picture,\u201d the Trimmer responded. \nA few more leaves cascaded onto the ground. The Distributor kept smiling. \n\u201cThank you,\u201d he said. \u201cThat's what I was working for, you know.\" \nIt was nearly 5 p.m., and the sun was sending streaks of orange into the sky. The Trimmer started whistling \u201cRaindrops Keep Falling on My Head.\u201d The Distributor took a big hit of the joint, and then turned to pass it, looking the Trimmer up and down. For a few moments, he stared. Then, with a sigh, he turned away. On the Trimmer\u2019s leather tool belt, tucked into a side holster, was a revolver. \u25cf ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "kevin davis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george runner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "barry broad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diane harkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "broad", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "california highway patrol", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "teamsters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trinity counties", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gestapo", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "america", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mendocino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sacramento", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "northern california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "humboldt", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-20T22:08:50.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "d83f69b3fc1b6715ded69e0922c9e2afe2d031ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRULI3Cl7YN6x1S4FCvs99Gc7PqaYpXsZ8PXwkijgLYTNc4teTYcr0m2CAksMO4cJ8-", "site_full": "www.buzzfeed.com", "site": "buzzfeed.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/buzzfeed/UteY", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BuzzFeed - Latest", "title": "If You Were A Pokemon, What Type Would You Be?", "title_full": "If You Were A Pokemon, What Type Would You Be?", "published": "2017-04-20T23:09:59.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-04/19/16/campaign_images/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/if-you-were-a-pokemon-what-type-would-you-be-2-11042-1492635033-1_dblbig.jpg", "performance_score": 9, "domain_rank": 137, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 904, "comments": 24, "shares": 904}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "d83f69b3fc1b6715ded69e0922c9e2afe2d031ce", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRULI3Cl7YN6x1S4FCvs99Gc7PqaYpXsZ8PXwkijgLYTNc4teTYcr0m2CAksMO4cJ8-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-04-20T23:09:59.000+03:00", "title": "If You Were A Pokemon, What Type Would You Be?", "text": "If You Were A Pokemon, What Type Would You Be?

Facebook: antoniojferme Twitter: antonio_Ferme [email protected] \nThis week has been packed full of #Marvel news. Captain Marvel found its directing duo , the first press screenings for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 hit , the New Warriors series characters revealed , and now, the first trailer for its upcoming #CloakandDagger TV series has officially been released. First Trailer For 'Cloak And Dagger' Has Hit The Web \nThis trailer is more like an extended sneak peak, but it did manage to give us a general idea of what the new series will be about. For those unfamiliar with the story in the #comicbooks , this is a coming-of-age drama revolving around two troubled teenagers, Tandy and Tyrone, who bump into each other, gain super powers, and go on the run. As the trailer also hinted at, the two will find a love for one another during the first season. Is that Roxxon? [Credit: Freeform] \nJust like the CW, Freeform is the home of many dramas and now, with Cloak & Dagger , Freeform can make the #Marvel series a flagship, which is why they decided to drop a teaser already, though the show isn't set to come out next year. Even know the show will focus on drama, we shouldn't be too worried as the CW shows have shown the world how you can mix drama into a YA-oriented superhero show in good ways. \nThe description of the show gives us some more insight on what to expect: \nCloak & Dagger is a coming-of-age series based on the beloved Marvel characters. Tandy Bowen (Olivia Holt) and Tyrone Johnson (Aubrey Joseph) come from starkly different backgrounds, each growing up with a secret they never dared share with another soul. \nOnce a privileged little girl, Tandy Bowen watched as her family was destroyed by a disastrous storm that uprooted her life. Now in her late teens, an unexpected encounter with a boy named Tyrone sparks a life changing event. \nYoung Tyrone Johnson wanted nothing more than to prove he was fearless. But when everything he held close was taken away, life taught Tyrone to be afraid. Now older and more sheltered, Tyrone closes himself off. But when he meets a girl named Tandy his life changes forever. Credit: Marvel \nBesides Holt and Joseph, the cast also includes Andrea Roth ( Blue Bloods ) as Melissa Bowen, Tandy\u2019s mom; Gloria Reuben ( ER ) as Tyrone\u2019s mother, Adina Johnson; Miles Mussenden ( Bloodline ) as Tyrone\u2019s father, Michael Johnson; Carl Lundstedt ( Grey\u2019s Anatomy ) as Liam, Tandy\u2019s partner in crime; James Saito ( Life of Pi ) as Dr. Bernard Sanjo, and J.D.

Throughout the video, Kendrick is dressed in a Kung Fu Kenny costume\u2014an homage to Cheadle\u2019s character from the 2001 movie Rush Hour 2 . Today, Cheadle spoke to Pitchfork over the phone about his appearance in the video, how he had two days to learn the lyrics, the ad-libbed dialogue from the video, his text conversations with Kendrick, the time he offered Kendrick an acting job, and how he only just figured out that he\u2019s the inspiration behind Kung Fu Kenny. \nPitchfork: You obviously learned the trumpet for your portrayal of Miles Davis in last year's biopic Miles Ahead. How did you prepare to rap in a Kendrick video? \nDon Cheadle: Well, it was a very different process. I didn\u2019t have to figure out how to play anything like I did for Miles Ahead . As opposed to about eight years to try to figure out the movie and get ready for that, I had two days to get ready for the video. Kendrick just hit me out of the blue and just said, \u201cHey man, I\u2019m going to do this video, do you wanna be in it?\u201d And I said, \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d And then he said, \u201cDo you want to know what the part is?\u201d He was like, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re gonna come in and play a cop, and you\u2019re interrogating me, and then you\u2019re just gonna spit my rap.\u201d \nI was like, \u201cUh OK, you know you\u2019re like the best rapper in the world, so what are you talking about.\u201d He sent me the lyrics and was like, \u201cYou just have to get this much of it down,\u201d which was like half of it [ laughs ]. I was like, \u201cAre you gonna have a teleprompter?\u201d And he said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s gonna be fine.\u201d \nSo I crammed like we have to do as actors. It\u2019s tricky, because it\u2019s not a linear process. His thought process is not linear. That was probably the trickiest part of it\u2014to figure out how thoughts led to each other. As a human being, he\u2019s pretty normal and straight ahead, but when you listen to his rhymes, he\u2019s constructing ideas in ways that are not immediately understandable. It takes a deep dive to kind of figure out why one verse creates the other verse and what it comes out of and all of that. So it\u2019s tricky to memorize because it\u2019s so specific to the way he thinks. But then when we got in there, we really just started playing. We just started improvising, really. \nIt\u2019s crazy that you only had two days. I wondered if you had this album weeks before everybody. \nNo. I literally had that song. They sent me that and said, \u201cCan you do it?\u201d And they sent me a couple of video clips of him literally just sitting in a trailer, just kind of moving. They said, \u201cWe want you to get his movements, \u2019cause you\u2019re kind of going to be mirroring him at some point.\u201d So they sent me a couple clips of the way he moved and him doing the rhyme, just really casual and laid back. And then we showed up and it happened really fast because they had the entire rest of that video they had to shoot with cars and all of that stuff. So we just kind of improv\u2019d it. The cameras moved around a lot. Nabil, who directed it, was just really clever about how to cover it. We did it like five or six times and that was it. \nThe part where you ask if he knows what \u201cDNA\u201d stands for\u2014was that something you came up with or was that Kendrick? \nThat was me. He just said, \u201cYou\u2019re a cop, and you\u2019re going to be messing with him and getting in his face. So just fuck with him.\u201d So I said, \u201cOK, well this would be a pretty fucked up thing to say\u201d [ laughs ]. So I just improv\u2019d all the dialogue, everything I said. I did it once, and after we finished it, Kendrick was like, \u201cYeah, say that again. Say exactly that. Do that one again.\u201d \nDid you see that Geraldo criticized Kendrick again ? \nKendrick sent that to me. It\u2019s just hilarious. It\u2019s like, \u201cWow dude, you don\u2019t have anything better to do? That\u2019s not your lane, bro.\u201d \nYou introduced Kendrick\u2019s amazing performance at the Grammys last year. What was it like being right there? \nIt was amazing, and again, it was a complete surprise. I was walking the red carpet and everybody was saying, \u201cHave you seen it? Do you know what he\u2019s going to do?\u201d And I was like, \u201cNo.\u201d It did not disappoint. \nRight before I announced it, they stuck me somewhere\u2014I had to go stand somewhere before I walked on stage\u2014and Robert Glasper just happened to be standing in front of me. Neither one of us knew, and as soon as it was over, he just turned around and looked at me, and we just stared at each other for 10 seconds. Like, \u201cWhat did we just see?\u201d Incredible. \nDid you already know Kendrick before then? \nDre had connected us because I wanted to use Kendrick in some project I was doing\u2014his music, for sure. I maybe wanted him to try his hand at acting, which he was very reticent to do at that time. He didn\u2019t feel like that was his lane and said he wasn\u2019t ready. I really appreciated that, because a lot of people are like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d just because they want that shine. He was like, \u201cNah, I don\u2019t do anything unless I know I can do it.\u201d \nBut we just stayed in touch from that point on. We texted, \u201cHey what\u2019s happening,\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201coh I\u2019m on tour, I\u2019m working on this music.\u201d I\u2019d be somewhere and I\u2019d get a text just out of the blue saying, \u201cwhat\u2019s up big bro, what\u2019s happening.\u201d So we just kind of stayed in touch like that over a couple years, and then a month ago, he said, \u201cOh I\u2019m gonna do this video, do you wanna do it?\u201d \nWhat\u2019s your take on the second half of the video? It shows this much more varied life than Geraldo or whoever is saying Kendrick represents. What\u2019s your take on what the video means? \nI loved it. I love the whole video. Like I said, to me, he is real. He\u2019s just real and straight-up and honest and truthful and generous to the degree that he lets you in. He lets you see the cracks in the armor. He lets you see his insecurities and all that stuff. It\u2019s just rare to have any kind of artist do that\u2014especially a hip-hop artist. He\u2019s kind of the anti-hip-hop artist in that way. \nWhat thoughts do you have about the rest of the album? \nI haven\u2019t heard it! I didn\u2019t even know that I was the Kung Fu Kenny model. I didn\u2019t know that until the next day. He got that from my character in Rush Hour 2 . He was like, \u201cDuh!\u201d He texted me like, \u201cDude are you serious? You didn\u2019t know that?\u201d I totally forgot about that. I\u2019ve been working too long, I didn\u2019t even remember that. \nHe\u2019s dressed like your character, right? \nYes! When he hit me, before the video, he said, \u201cThe video, it\u2019s gonna be here, and I\u2019ve got a little surprise for you.\u201d I was like, \u201cCool.\u201d So I showed up, I did the thing, then I left, and I did not put it together. Then I went to Coachella and saw him perform, and I saw the video before the thing and still didn\u2019t figure it out. And then I went on Twitter and someone had randomly tweeted, \u201cDon Cheadle is the original Kung Fu Kenny.\u201d I went, \u201cWait a minute, I did play a character named Kenny who did kung fu and spoke Chinese.\u201d \nAnd I texted Kendrick and was like, \u201cHey man, am I the inspiration for Kung Fu Kenny? Because I\u2019m going to say I am whether I am or not.\u201d He was like, \u201cFam, that was the surprise. So, surprise!\u201d Oh shit! I feel stupid now. \nI wonder what he was thinking the whole two days when we were together and I hadn\u2019t said anything about it. He was like, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this dude? Is he senile? Does he hate it? Is he not a fan?\u201d It was obvious. Now, when you say it, it\u2019s obvious. \nYou talked about Kendrick and Kamasi Washington while you did press for Miles Ahead , and you worked with Robert Glasper. How do you find new music? \nThrough them. It\u2019s kind of like how Joseph Campbell talked about how he became a scholar. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m a scholar, but he\u2019d read all the people he liked and then he\u2019d go and read all the people that they read. Then he\u2019d read that person and see who that person read. That\u2019s kind of how it is. I look at the people that Rob has worked with. You look at the tracks and see who the people are. You find them and what their music is and who they\u2019ve worked with. It just kind of works like that. Christian Sands, Christian McBride, Walter Smith III, Kamasi Washington\u2014all these young cats that are really doing it now. And the guys who have still been doing for a long time. I still listen to Wynton [Marsalis], who I love. \nAre we going to see you rapping again anytime soon? \n[ Laughs ] I have no plans, but never say never.

April 19 2017 8:04 PM The Mysterious Case of the Wayward Aircraft Carrier This is a dangerous way for the world\u2019s most powerful military to operate. The USS Carl Vinson in the South China Sea on April 8. Mass Communication Specialist 3rd Class Matt Brown/U.S. Navy via Getty Images \nThere is a sobering reality beyond this week\u2019s strange \u201cWhere\u2019s Waldo?\u201d story of the USS Carl Vinson and its strike group: For a period of time, significant confusion existed as to the location of a U.S. aircraft carrier strike group, one of the most potent weapons in the American arsenal, at a moment of high tension on the Korean Peninsula. \nAlthough not (yet) a major crisis, this incident portends deep problems with the White House, its chain of command, and its approach to national security. At best, The Vinson episode suggests policy gaps between the president and his top military advisers over how to act toward North Korea. Worse, it appears the president has not firmly established control over the chain of command\u2014or that he possibly overdelegated authority to his generals and admirals. Further, this incident sends deeply disturbing signals to allies and adversaries regarding the president\u2019s control over the military and the credibility of his statements, diluting the deterrent value of American words and actions. Advertisement \nLet\u2019s start with two fundamental premises of U.S. civil-military relations. First, the president is the elected commander in chief of the military; short of declaring war, he has the power to order military deployments and operations, and be held politically accountable for them. Second, the president ought to know with accuracy the locations and readiness of major U.S. military assets, and have the ability to command those forces as needed to protect the country. \nAny departure from these norms stands out as potentially threatening to national security. When, in 2007, the Air Force lost track of nuclear weapons and inadvertently allowed them to fly over the continental United States mounted on a bomber, then\u2013Defense Secretary Robert Gates rightfully saw the incident as an abomination and fired the Air Force leadership. Get Slate in your inbox. \nIn the case of the Vinson , any movement toward similar accountability starts in a complete muddle. Did President Trump and Press Secretary Sean Spicer deliberately mislead the public with their statements about the carrier\u2019s whereabouts? Were they misinformed by the Pentagon? Or were they carelessly freelancing with their comments to be more bellicose toward Korea? Any of these scenarios is fraught with peril; all depart from established norms of civil-military relations that dictate the president speak with authority and accuracy about the military forces he commands. It\u2019s also unclear who, exactly, ordered the Vinson and its battle group to steam toward North Korea, let alone whether that was fully coordinated with the Pentagon or other parts of the government. \nOne possibility is that U.S. Pacific Command, led by Adm. Harry Harris, ordered the Vinson maneuvers to create options for the White House in anticipation of a tougher policy on Korea. The sequence of events bears this out, given that Harris\u2019 announcement preceded any notice from the White House or Pentagon, suggesting there was little coordination in advance. This accords with the general hawkishness of Pacific Command on issues relating to China and North Korea\u2014hawkishness which differed greatly from the Obama administration. This scenario would align with President Trump\u2019s recent aloofness toward his role in the chain of command, as well as the preferences of top advisers like Steve Bannon and H.R. McMaster, who, respectively, want to \u201c de-operationalize \u201d the National Security Council and implement a \u201c mission command \u201d style of direction for the military. The recent delegation of authority to commanders overseeing the Afghanistan war\u2014who, in turn, decided to drop the \u201cMassive Ordnance Air Blast\u201d bomb in ISIS fighters near the Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan border\u2014fits this pattern as well. Advertisement \nA second possibility is that the Trump administration, perhaps led by Defense Secretary James Mattis, ordered the carrier move. If so, this does not represent a civil-military relations problem per se; ordering around aircraft carriers is unquestionably a presidential prerogative. However, it does highlight weaknesses in the White House\u2019s competence and expertise in the use of military force. The disconnects between the White House and Pentagon statements suggest a lack of close coordination, much less any substantive follow-up such as complementary movement of air and ground forces. (Although troop movements are generally kept classified, significant moves like these are hard to conceal, and they are often publicized because there is greater deterrent value in making such moves openly.) This lack of coordination isn\u2019t helped by the unfilled appointments throughout the Trump administration, nor the infancy of the administration itself, which makes the whole enterprise function as something less than a \u201c fine-tuned machine .\u201d In Moscow and Beijing, President Trump\u2019s word now carries less force. \nSimilarly, it\u2019s unclear whether McMaster or Mattis fully played out the scenario surrounding the Vinson \u2019s dispatch and the potential commitment of two other carriers to the waters near Korea. Sending three carriers to the Western Pacific deprives the Navy\u2014with its 11 total carriers\u2014of the ability to rotate carriers through other missions, including support for the actual wars being fought in Iraq/Syria and Afghanistan. Just as the Army and Marines surged in Iraq and Afghanistan during tough fighting periods, so too can the Navy surge its carrier groups in a crisis\u2014but it cannot maintain this posture indefinitely. And although President Trump pledged to build a larger Navy during the campaign, he can\u2019t build one overnight, or possibly even during his presidency . Trump\u2019s impulsive and seemingly uncoordinated commitment of a carrier here could constrain his options for years to come. \nThe Vinson episode also illustrates, once again, how questions about the president\u2019s truthfulness can have adverse strategic consequences. Our friends and allies, including South Korea , can hardly take comfort in knowing the American cavalry is coming when the administration speaks so cavalierly. Conversely, America\u2019s adversaries listen to every presidential word\u2014whether he wants to be taken literally or not. They also check those words against their intelligence, gathered via their own satellites, spies, and other means. The Russians and Chinese watch the Vinson \u2019s movements closely and surely noticed the gap between the statements from Pacific Command, the Pentagon, and the White House. Bluffing works in statecraft, but only when your opponent can\u2019t see your cards. In Moscow and Beijing, President Trump\u2019s word now carries less force because he has devalued it by making statements that are demonstrably untrue about the deployment of American military forces. Top Comment \nThis is from Kevin D Williamson, A right wing Writer at National Review: Every day, the incoherence deepens: He\u2019s going to cover \u201ceveryone,\u201d but he\u2019s going to push 24 million people off their health insurance. More... Join In \nIf the current tension with North Korea resolves on its own, the curious case of the wayward carrier may not matter much. But if we are indeed headed for a major crisis like the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis or the 1994 showdown with North Korea over nukes, then it matters greatly that the White House, Pentagon, and Pacific Command are marching to the beats of separate drummers. Imagine if, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the military had inadvertently moved forces in Europe to create options for the Kennedy administration or otherwise signaled hostile intent to the Soviets. That crisis might have ended far differently, with potentially catastrophic consequences. \nThe presidency\u2019s national security responsibilities are too complex to be handled like a family real-estate business or reality television show . President Trump and his advisers need to communicate much more clearly with each other, and he must personally exercise greater control over the forces he commands, or else his presidency (and possibly the world ) will end in disaster. \nPhillip Carter is a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and adjunct professor of law at Georgetown University.

A flurry of comments followed, reassuring the lady that all will be well. \nMeanwhile, the admins of \u201cApril Giraffe Friends,\u201d who were alerted to the post, decided to take matters into their own hands. They sent her a text on Facebook Messenger. However, the lady did not respond. \nConcerned, the admins managed to pull up the woman\u2019s details from her Facebook page and alerted the police. \nThe cops at Darby Police Department, Pennsylvania, went to the lady\u2019s last known address, but she wasn\u2019t around. After a couple of hours, the police managed to get in touch with her son and his family, who were living in a different jurisdiction. \nSpeaking to the Inquisitr , on condition of anonymity, the admin who alerted the cops said, \u201cThe police got back to me later. The lady wasn\u2019t staying at her son\u2019s place, but the family knew where she was at and they were very concerned about her. She is fine now.\u201d \n\u201cWhat I found strange was the lady had posted many times within that evening\u2014all happy things and then suddenly, this post,\u201d said the admin, who mostly saw posts related to April and the calf. \nFor Carla Pelham, the chief admin of April Giraffe Friends group, tackling the situation was quite challenging. \n\u201cI felt that we had a duty of care to this person. We needed to make sure she was fine. There was no way we could ignore someone who was brave enough to reach out. The police were amazing and told us we had done the right thing and, if we experienced this again, we must report it. They even gave us an update saying that contact was made with the lady. No further details were released to us due to privacy laws,\u201d she said. \nShedding light on people who post suicidal remarks on social media, Prof Jonathan J. Detrixhe, clinical supervisor and adjunct professor at Long Island University, said, \u201cPeople who post their suicidal intentions to strangers, rather than friends and family members, may have no one else to turn to for an intervention \u2014 or they may be looking for a judgement-free place to discuss their interest in suicide.\u201d \nBut social media isn\u2019t the place for that sort of in-depth sharing of complicated feelings, he said. \n\u201cIn my experience with suicidal patients, the situation needs to be directed offline. Friends and family need to respond directly, in person or by phone. The goal would be to validate the person\u2019s feelings,\u201d he said. \nIt\u2019s not just the old people who display suicidal tendencies online. \nAccording to Angela Robinson Giuffra, a licensed clinical social worker, even teens and young adults take to social media to express their frustration or thoughts of suicide. \u201cAs an adolescent and young adult specialist, I have seen the isolating effects of social media use on this population. Depressed, anxious young people who are withdrawn and not engaged in the outside world take to the internet. They use Youtube for entertainment and chat rooms for supports groups for mental health disorders, etc. They come to see the internet as their connection to the outside world,\u201d she said. \nIn an effort to help people with suicidal tendencies, Facebook recently launched a new set of tools. \n\u201cWhen someone is thinking of suicide or hurting themselves, we already have tools that let friends reach out directly or report a post to us so we can help. But with billions of posts, comments and messages every day, we\u2019re limited by what people actually report to us.

The media conglomerate has converted some of its classic animated films into live-action movies over the years. And with its latest adaptation in the works, Will Smith may play the Genie in Aladdin , according to Deadline . His background in music makes him the obvious choice, if you ask me. \nAs reported by Deadline , Smith is reportedly currently in talks to play the lovable Genie, a role once made famous by the late Robin Williams . And while Williams' shoes are pretty big to fill, there's certainly no doubt that Smith's comedic timing and musical background more than qualify him for the part. For the few of you who may not know, Jaden and Willow Smith's dad was quite the accomplished rapper prior to bursting onto the acting scene in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in the early '90s. \nI'm not 100 percent sure, but Smith's addition to the Aladdin cast could perhaps be part of a strategic plan to infuse a bit of hip-hop flair into the whimsical character's persona. And this could be just what the film needs to give the entire movie a much-needed update since it first premiered nearly 25 years ago. Kinda like... Fresh Prince meets Aladdin , you know? I don't know about you, but I'm totally here for it. Giphy \nWhile all of the details surrounding Smith's potential involvement remain unclear, there's one thing that appears to be totally evident: Disney adaptations equal success \u2014 both monetarily and in terms of fan excitement. In less than two months since its release in February of this year, Beauty and the Beast has grossed more than $1 billion worldwide , Vanity Fair reported. \nThe 1992 animated version of Aladdin was also a huge success for the media giant, grossing over $504 million, according to Box Office Mojo. With that said, the live-action adaptation could prove to make out pretty swell at the box office \u2014 that is, if all goes well with the production and casting. Giphy \nIt doesn't hurt that the second coming will be directed by Guy Ritchie , with Jonathan Eirich and Dan Lin serving as producers, The Hollywood Reporter reported. The film is also said to be scripted straight from the original version by John August, so it certainly seems to be lining itself up for success. \nNow, all we need is for Smith to grant us one of our three wishes and sign on to play the magical role.

If you're going to remake one of the best westerns ever, which itself is a remake of one of the best movies ever, you ought to do it right. It seems clear to me that the makers of this movie just didn\u2019t get the original films. Of course a remake does not have to be a duplication, but the best parts - the heart and soul - should be there, and in this movie they were not. Beyond that, I just didn't belive in a single character. What do I remember? Something about a gatling gun. Well, I own the movie now, so there's ample opportunity to watch it again. Yippee. More Than I Expected.. by *gracie* Was not expecting to like this movie but it was my dad's choice that day for the movie theatre, so we saw this. There was action, jokes, amazing characters and a great script. I was laughing at some scenes, biting my nails at others and cheering for the characters at other points. I am normally a rom-com/Disney kind of girl or something with a lot of car chases but this I enjoyed and would recomend to anyone. 23 year old female. by ProfPolish As the weeks and months and years roll by we lose a little bit more of what used to be.Before cgi, there was practical fx. Character development, writing, casting, and location. You handed that to a director and cinematographer and said make a movie. Now maybe it's because I'm 40 and don't think like a millennial but I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Will it win an oscar? No... it doesn't have to, I was captivated by it. It was an old timey western. I love Chris Pratt and Denzel, and I actually welled up at the end, the voice over with those 4 tombstones in the sunset, there was something poetic about it.

For those not as up to date on the goings on within the Teen Mom OG world, Abraham purchased her own 14-carat diamond sparkler in hopes of Simon popping the question. When Simon failed to make good on his promise to propose and pay her back, they went their separate ways. \n\"I found that ring that I kept thinking that you we're going to get it and reimburse me for it,\" she quips, to which Simon responds, \"You're still bringing that up, huh?\" \n\"I'm not going to be hung up on somebody who's not really going to commit,\" Abraham continues. \nTo find out how Farrah and Simon's blowout ends, watch the clip above! \nTeen Mom OG airs Monday nights at 9 p.m. on MTV.

But after the March for Science movement began in the US, some are organising protests to stand up for their colleagues across the pond \u2013 and for themselves. Posted on Share On link \nWhen Story Sylwester set up a Facebook group five days after President Trump\u2019s inauguration, she didn\u2019t intend to organise a march on parliament, she just knew she had to do something . \nBut this Saturday, April 22, thanks to the efforts of Sylwester and dozens of other volunteers around the UK, thousands of people are expected to march in London, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Manchester, and Bristol in support of science. They join thousands more scientists at over 400 satellite marches around the world, as well as at the main event in Washington, DC. \nSylwester is originally from the US and moved to the UK to do an MSc in paleopathology \u2013 looking at bones for evidence of disease \u2013 at Durham University. Seeing events in the US unfold from across the pond \u2013 a short-lived order preventing US Department of Agriculture employees communicating science to the public, for example, or Trump appointing a new head of the US Environmental Protection Agency who\u2019s expressed doubts that humans are causing global warming \u2013 Sylwester says she needed to feel like she was taking action. \n\u201cI was very excited that a movement for science was happening. It occurred to me that if I wanted to go to a march, then it might be good to just start a group myself,\u201d she tells BuzzFeed News. \u201cI wasn\u2019t intending, originally, to take a role in the planning of our London march. \n\u201cI\u2019ve never done anything like this before.\u201d Share \nStory Sylwester, an organiser for the London science march, at Durham University where she studies paleopathology. \nSince then the movement, in the US at least, has been mired in debate about how organisers have dealt with diversity , or whether it\u2019s too political , and even about whether scientists should be marching at all. Geologist Robert Young argued in an op-ed in the New York Times that \u201ca march by scientists, while well intentioned, will serve only to trivialize and politicize the science we care so much about, turn scientists into another group caught up in the culture wars.\u201d \nMeanwhile, in the UK, many scientists like Sylwester are picking up placards and getting involved in organising for the first time. \n\u201cScientists are not famous for their camaraderie,\u201d David Reay, professor of carbon management at the University of Edinburgh told the Science Media Centre. \u201cWe are trained to question, criticise and, where needed, contest each other\u2019s work. We compete for funding, vie for tenure and race to be first to a new discovery. That we are now marching together is testament to just how threatened our disparate community feels.\u201d \nAs well as standing in solidarity with fellow scientists in the US and celebrating the positives of science at a time when experts are feeling increasingly ignored, they are highlighting local issues \u2013 including how Brexit is affecting their labs and how important science is for the UK economy. Share \nCardiff organisers Edward Jones, Jenny Wymant, and Sarah Jaffa outside the Cardiff Welsh Assembly. \nRoberto Cahuantzi, a PhD student at the University of Sheffield, originally from Mexico, is one of them. When he heard about the March for Science movement, he knew he wanted to go to one. But when it looked like nobody else was going to set anything up near him, he did it himself, creating the Facebook group that became the March for Science in Manchester . \n\u201cI have been feeling this trend in society about how a lot of politicians are blatantly disregarding the advice of experts. I have felt very impotent in front of these things, like Brexit, the Trump presidency, the problems that Mexican politics has,\u201d he says. \u201cI am trying to feel that I am doing something for a greater good.\u201d \nCahuantzi says climate change is the biggest issue the world is facing right now, and he thinks politicians are ignoring the advice of scientists on it. \u201cI think it\u2019s very, very important for us to speak up, to let them know that we want solutions, real solutions, not procrastination and scapegoating,\u201d he says. \nAll three members of the team behind the Cardiff march are new to protest organising, too. \u201cI think a lot of scientists aren't normally involved in this kind of activity; it's like there's been a big jump in awareness of the issues around this,\u201d Sarah Jaffa, a PhD student in astrophysics at Cardiff University, told BuzzFeed News. \nJenny Wymant, a cancer researcher, also at Cardiff, says they\u2019ve been getting help from people around the country as they begin to navigate this new sphere. \n\u201cIt's really nice because that's how science works too,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you don't know how to do a thing, you go and find an engineer that does, or you go and find a chemist who can help you make a thing, and the march is like a little reflection of that.\u201d ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "",

Mensch Has A List Of Suspected Russian Agents", "text": "Tech Louise Mensch Has A List Of Suspected Russian Agents The former British MP leads an outraged online investigation into Trump's connection to Russia. Is it pulling in innocent people? Originally posted on April 21, 2017, 22:43 GMT Updated on Share \nSince last November\u2019s election, the former British politician Louise Mensch has transformed herself into the leader of a wide-ranging internet investigation into Russian espionage and influence in American politics, media, and business. Every day, Mensch and her network of online detectives unravel what they claim is a massive conspiracy linking the Kremlin, the Republican Party, armies of internet trolls, and moneyed puppet masters around the world. \nMensch, who sometimes tweets hundreds of times a day, has claimed or implied that targets ranging from top government officials to journalists to teenagers to anonymous Twitter users are in thrall to Vladimir Putin. \nJust since Inauguration Day, according to an extensive review of her tweets, the New York\u2013based Mensch has accused at least 210 people and organizations of being under Russian government influence. \nMensch's campaign has played out largely on Twitter and, since January of this year, a blog called Patribotics . But she has also been validated at the highest levels of English-language media: She published an op-ed in the New York Times , appeared on MSNBC and Real Time With Bill Maher earlier this year, and was the subject of a flattering Guardian profile . And her relentless tweets and passionate following have made her a central figure in a new obsession with Russian influence that recalls Cold War\u2013era divisions over Communist infiltration. That \u201cred scare\u201d reached its paranoid height in the late 1940s and early 1950s, when substantive fears of (real) Soviet intelligence operations turned into a politicized hall of mirrors in which figures like Sen. Joe McCarthy ruined the lives and careers of thousands of Americans with baseless allegations of working for Moscow. (The era also persuaded some on the \u201canti-anti-Communist\u201d left that real Soviet spies were innocent victims of hysteria; their guilt was settled with the opening of the Soviet archives at the end of the Cold War.) \nMensch\u2019s list includes 35 American politicians and government officials, 26 journalists, 26 organizations and corporations (among them think tanks, banks, media outlets, foreign intelligence agencies, and security firms), 18 Russians, 18 US citizens notable for political donations or affiliations, 80 low-profile Twitter accounts Mensch has characterized as \u201cPutinbots\u201d or similar (many of which appear to belong to Americans who support President Trump), and two British politicians. The list includes figures as disparate as Bernie Sanders and Sean Hannity. \nAmong the 210 named by Mensch are individuals and entities who do have obvious or reported ties to the Russian government and intelligence agencies, ranging from WikiLeaks \u2014 which has denied that accusation \u2014 to the anonymous hacker Guccifer 2.0 to the Kremlin-owned news agency Sputnik . Mensch\u2019s specific allegations draw on the reality of a large-scale and widely documented Russian campaign to influence the US election. But in many cases, she lacks strong, or any, evidence connecting her targets to that campaign. \nIn addition to the journalists, media personalities, and politicians, among those fingered are a Twitter comedian, a fake White House staff account, and a 15-year-old girl who Mensch suggested does not actually exist except as a Kremlin fabrication (BuzzFeed News interviewed the teenager via phone after first visiting her home). \nMensch\u2019s criteria for accusing someone of being under Russian influence vary. Sometimes she cites her own and others\u2019 reporting. In some cases, she points out suspicious geotags and catfishing attempts. In others, mangled English syntax appears to be enough to prove Russia ties. She has accused people of being affiliated with Russia simply for disagreeing with her or calling her theories far-fetched, but she has also called someone a Russian agent for being too enthusiastic about her own theories. \nMany of the people Mensch has accused vociferously deny involvement with the Russian government. Many of those share the attribute that nobody other than Mensch has ever accused them of it. \n\u201cI am proud of my service to this country and to be a loyal first generation American, to suggest anything otherwise is both absolutely false and offensive to me, my family and first generation and naturalized citizens who continue to serve this great country,\u201d Naveed Jamali, a former FBI double agent whom Mensch has accused of being a Russian spy, wrote to BuzzFeed in an email . \nThe political strategist Evan Siegfried denied Mensch\u2019s accusation that he is a \u201cKremlin troll.\u201d \n\u201cIn no way, shape or form am I or have I ever been a Kremlin operative, Russian agent or party to aiding Putin and/or Russia. Any and all accusations are not only false, but strain credulity. The closest I've come to Russia was the time I went to NYC's Russian Tea Room in 1993. I was ten,\u201d he said in an email. \nReached for comment by Twitter direct message, Mensch said that, if anything, the number of Russian agents she identified was understated. \n\"No, I doubt that number is accurate. I am quite certain the number is going to be a lot larger than 210 people or organizations once the trials are finished. It takes a village to elect a President who is working hand in glove with the Kremlin both in terms of propaganda and hacking collusion - and that's before we even get to the money laundering.\" \nMensch went on to say that her criteria for determining whether or not someone was a Russian agent depended on \"Intelligence, from sources; actions; words, such as tweets; and other primary source material.\" \nAsked about her accusations against Jamali, Mensch referred BuzzFeed News to earlier tweets about a dispute between the two. She provided no evidence that Jamali is a Russian spy, and did not address a query about why she thinks Siegfried is a Russian agent. \nMensch had a colorful and storied career in British public life, which reached its peak when, as a Tory member of Parliament, she grilled Rupert Murdoch over his role in the News of the World phone-hacking scandal. She moved to the US in 2012, at one point founded a social network intended to rival Twitter, and in April 2016 started a conservative news site for Murdoch\u2019s company, News Corp. (She left the site, Heat Street, in January, and tweeted in March that she had left News Corp, which a company spokesman confirmed.) \nAn ally of intelligence services and a fierce critic of Edward Snowden and the press who published his leaked material, Mensch in 2016 established herself as a prominent voice on the Trump campaign\u2019s ties to Russia. Her following grew in November, when she published a blockbuster story alleging that the FBI had been granted a FISA warrant in order to examine connections between Trump and Russia. Other media outlets later reported that the US government had indeed obtained a FISA warrant in connection with the Trump campaign, though the details of those reports have differed from hers. That story won her legitimacy among close followers of the Trump-Russia story (BuzzFeed News reporters, among others, spoke to her to see if she had information that could advance reporting on Russia), and she has continued to use it as a calling card. And Mensch told BuzzFeed News that her reporting on Trump's connections to Russia are being borne out. \nBut recently \u2014 and particularly over the last month \u2014 Mensch has become increasingly outspoken in labeling accounts who disagree with her \u201cKremlin shills,\u201d \u201cPutinbots,\u201d and \u201cRIS,\u201d Russian intelligence services. \nSome of her targets say they are puzzled and alarmed by her attention. \n\u201cIt\u2019s been very frustrating to encounter people who assume I\u2019m a Kremlin propagandist simply because one of my jobs has the word 'Moscow' in it,\u201d said Kevin Rothrock, the web editor of the Moscow Times , whom Mensch referred to as \u201c Vlad \u201d \u2014 her oft-used shorthand for an agent of Vladimir Putin \u2014 after Rothrock chided Mensch for \u201ctweeting the dumbest shit.\u201d The Moscow Times , which is known as a training ground for foreign correspondents, has a reputation as a rare independent voice in Russian media. Mensch did not respond to a query about why she thinks Rothrock may be a Russian agent. \nMensch\u2019s critics have accused her of fomenting an anti-Russia panic. In an article last month in Rolling Stone , journalist Matt Taibbi warned of a resurgent \u201ccase of mass hysteria\u201d about Russia among politicians and journalists. \n(Mensch has speculated that Taibbi, who once lived and worked in Russia, \u201cmight be a Russian agent.\u201d \n\u201cI am not a Russian agent,\u201d Taibbi said to BuzzFeed News. \u201cI have never been engaged in any kind of espionage work.\u201d \nMensch did not respond to a query about why she thinks Taibbi may be a Russian agent.) \nSome have accused Mensch of going too far. Cassandra Fairbanks, an American social media personality and journalist, filed a complaint with the FBI against Mensch, alleging a \"months long campaign of cyber stalking and harassment.\" (Fairbanks works for the Russian-owned Sputnik.) Others, including Taibbi, suspect that going too far may be part of what has made Mensch such a popular figure. \n\u201cA lot of her success has come from some of the same instincts that have given Trump success,\u201d Taibbi said. \u201cThe ability to generate headlines [is] a quality that is good to have if you are an attention-seeking person in the internet age.\u201d \nAnd one way to generate headlines and amass a following in a bitterly divided political climate \u2014 as Donald Trump has demonstrated \u2014 is to find someone to blame. Indeed, if her tweets are to be believed, the number of people Louise Mensch believes to be agents of Russian influence may exceed 210 astronomically:", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "louise mensch", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rothrock", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murdoch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evan siegfried", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joe mccarthy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sean hannity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mensch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naveed jamali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rupert murdoch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill maher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cassandra fairbanks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bernie sanders", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "edward snowden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "siegfried", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taibbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "matt taibbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guccifer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jamali", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin rothrock", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "news corp", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wikileaks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buzzfeed news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "msnbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mensch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fbi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "news corp.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "times", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nyc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kremlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "parliament", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump-russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kremlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-22T01:54:19.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "3f41bcd497c1cb25e1848ed1d6bacb930f82496a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRULI3Cl7YN6x1S4FCvs99GQFFqyXCFhWZt.Sf6LAYK9HOQJZmBOoLZn07rDxyvYzS36Wmr5FnFvc.azyi4oAI6A09SkkRDEe4-", "site_full": "www.buzzfeed.com", "site": "buzzfeed.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/buzzfeed/UteY", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BuzzFeed - Latest", "title": "11 Things People With Rosacea Should Know", "title_full": "11 Things People With Rosacea Should Know", "published": "2017-04-21T17:37:58.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-04/12/19/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-web-14/original-23241-1492038624-1.jpg?crop=640:335;0,182", "performance_score": 7, "domain_rank": 137, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 789, "comments": 33, "shares": 789}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "3f41bcd497c1cb25e1848ed1d6bacb930f82496a", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRULI3Cl7YN6x1S4FCvs99GQFFqyXCFhWZt.Sf6LAYK9HOQJZmBOoLZn07rDxyvYzS36Wmr5FnFvc.azyi4oAI6A09SkkRDEe4-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-04-21T17:37:58.000+03:00", "title": "11 Things People With Rosacea Should Know", "text": "11 Things People With Rosacea Should Know The things I wish I'd known years ago. Posted on Share On link \nWe hope you love the products we recommend! Just so you know, BuzzFeed may collect a share of sales from the links on this page. 1. As it's Rosacea Awareness Month I wanted to write a post with all the information I wish someone had told me years ago. Share \nI found out I had rosacea when I was 21 and my doctor diagnosed me with a skin condition I'd never even heard of. 12 years later I have tried a lot of products, experienced countless flare ups and even built a career from talking about my passion for skincare and beauty on my blog . If you have rosacea, you will know all too well that every person is unique and therefore experiences symptoms in very different ways so I've tried to keep the advice quite generic but I hope it helps. There are some links at the bottom for further information if you would like to do more research. 2. Find your triggers. instagram.com \nThis is easily the most important piece of advice I give to people. Rosacea is characterised by flare ups that are a result of internal or external effects. There are many common triggers that most people with rosacea share (e.g. exposure to the sun, emotional stress, alcohol, exercise). However, everyone is different so it's vital that you pinpoint exactly what affects your skin and how it manifests itself so that you can notice patterns. I kept a diary where I noted everything I could think of that could have had an impact \u2013 which is how I noticed triggers that I never would have considered, like lack of sleep. 3. Pick your battles. instagram.com \nOnce you've found your triggers, try not to feel overwhelmed. Identifying your triggers doesn't mean you *have* to remove them, it's all about personal choice. For me, I notice the difference in my skin when I consume dairy so I choose not to eat it 95% of the time. But for that 5% of the time, when I have an utterly terrible week and just need cheese (we've all been there) I go for it. But I also understand that I will have to accept the consequences, a bit like a hangover. On my face. 4. SPF is your BFF. instagram.com \nIn the words of Baz Luhrmann, wear sunscreen. The moment I go out in the sun, I can feel my skin prickling, itching and getting warm. I wear SPF 50 every single day and never ever sunbathe because it's guaranteed to play havoc with my skin. Those with rosacea or sensitive skin should look for mineral sunscreens \u2013 often called physical sunscreens \u2013 as they reflect the sun's rays to protect you, as opposed to chemical sunscreens that absorb the rays which can in turn heat up your skin.

[Credit: Marvel] By Eleanor Tremeer , writer at Creators.co MP staff. I talk about Star Wars a lot. Sometimes I'm paid for it. \nMarvel may have got the head start (by almost a decade), but DC is catching up to the franchise titan with several movies under the #DCEU 's belt and a ton more announced to be developed in the next few years. One such movie is Batgirl , a proposed film focusing on the young budding sleuth who follows in Batman's footsteps \u2014 and in news that delighted and distressed people in almost equal measure, Joss Whedon was tapped to direct. But before all the debates lit up the internet in a storm of flame wars, most people were just surprised Warner Bros. went to Joss Whedon considering his history with Marvel Studios. \nJoss Whedon is nothing if not a prolific director \u2014 after Buffy The Vampire Slayer became a pop culture sensation, the director went on to showrun several popular TV shows before launching the #MCU into team-up movie tradition with 2012's The Avengers . Whedon & Marvel: A Love/Hate Story \nThe Avengers was hugely successful, earning over a billion dollars at the box office and beginning what was possibly the MCU's golden age of solo movies. His second outing with Age of Ultron , however, was less successful critically (though it still earned over a billion), with many people critiquing the convoluted plot, weak villain, and tired quippy dialogue \u2014 and the less said of poor Black Widow's awkward romantic subplot the better. \nWhedon blamed much of the problems on #Marvel , citing creative differences and complaining that he wasn't allowed the freedom he had on The Avengers. As has now become something of a tradition between Marvel Studios and their directors (several others left projects for similar reasons), it looked like the relationship between Whedon and Marvel was left rather uneasy. \nWant More Batgirl?

Lucas Jackson / Reuters ID: 10933475 \nWASHINGTON \u2014 Fifteen thousand Afghans have applied to a special visa program for those who worked as interpreters for the US military and now risk being killed. But the State Department tells BuzzFeed News that fewer than 1,500 visas and a massive backlog of applications remain, leaving more than 13,000 Afghans to wait in uncertainty. \nNow, a bipartisan group of senators is pushing to authorize more visas and prevent further life-threatening backlogs as part of a bill that would prevent a government shutdown next week \u2014 a push that has failed in the past. \nAfghans who have worked as interpreters and translators for the US during the War in Afghanistan, which has lasted more than a decade, have faced everything from death threats to torture and murder, often as their applications for safe haven in the US languished. \n\u201cThe Taliban decapitated the heads of my uncle, my cousin, and my best friend, Ateeq, all because I supported the infidels,\u201d Fahim Muhammad, an Afghan interpreter, said in 2013, according to a report by the Harvard Kennedy School Review . \nRepublican infighting last Congress left the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) program with thousands fewer visas than needed to continue processing a backlog of applications. But if lawmakers fail this time, more than 13,000 Afghan interpreters could be further stranded by a US government that promised to protect them in exchange for their service. \nThe Afghan visa program currently requires applicants to have worked for the US for at least two years and provide a sworn statement describing the \u201congoing serious threat\u201d they face as a result of their work. Family members who also face threats are eligible as well. \nThe State Department, faced with a visa shortage, stopped scheduling new interviews for the program on March 1 of this year. Spokesperson Will Cocks told BuzzFeed News that as of March 5, there were only 1,437 visas left \u2014 and approximately 15,000 applications in the system. Those figures do not include the families of interpreters. \n\u201cThese are people who were working for us in an environment where if you\u2019re seen as working for the US government, that might make you like a target for groups that have opposed the US,\u201d Cocks said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve always taken these threats very seriously.\u201d \nDemocratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, Richard Blumenthal, and Jack Reed, as well as Republican Sen. Thom Tillis, have written a letter to the Senate Appropriations committee, which makes decisions about federal funding, asking it to include at least 2,500 more visas for Afghan interpreters in \u201cwhatever mechanism funds the State Department through the end of Fiscal Year 2017.\u201d The number is far short of what\u2019s needed to address the backlog, but 2,500 is the amount lawmakers believe they can reasonably pass right now \u2014 and is based off the last administration\u2019s estimate of what the State Department can handle in one year. \n\u201cAs you know, the Afghan SIV program offers carefully vetted Afghans whose lives are in danger because of the critical assistance they provided to our soldiers and diplomats the chance to seek refuge in the United States,\u201d reads the letter, dated March 16 and provided to BuzzFeed News by Shaheen\u2019s office. \u201cUnfortunately, this critical program is projected to run out of visas by the end of May, stranding many thousands of qualified Afghans.\u201d \nThe senators\u2019 request comes as the Appropriations committees in the House and Senate negotiate a funding bill to prevent a government shutdown after April 28, when current funding is slated to run out. \nIn a separate effort to allocate more visas, a group of senators on the Armed Services committee \u2014 Shaheen, Reed, Tillis, and Sen. John McCain \u2014 introduced legislation in mid-March to approve another 2,500 visas. \nIt\u2019s unclear, however, whether the recent request to the Senate Appropriations committee to allocate the remaining 2,500 visas for this year through the government funding bill will be granted. It would again require sign-off from a range of lawmakers, including those on the Senate Judiciary committee, where the visas\u2019 fate is uncertain. \nIn June 2016, Shaheen and McCain spearheaded efforts to reauthorize the program for another year and allocate 4,000 new visas. But they were faced with opposition from GOP Sens. Jeff Sessions \u2014 now the US attorney general \u2014 and Chuck Grassley, who heads the Judiciary Committee, which oversees immigration-related legislation. \nThe Huffington Post reported at the time that though Sessions and Grassley publicly cited costs and other issues in opposing additional visas for the program, their staff, in emails that have also been shared with BuzzFeed News, privately expressed a desire to shrink the program and reduce immigration numbers more broadly. \nGrassley\u2019s office did not respond to repeated requests for comment about whether he still opposes expanding the visa program. A spokesperson for the GOP majority on the House Appropriations committee also did not return a request for comment. \nMcCain, at the time, also accused Utah Sen. Mike Lee, who tried to hold up the amendment to get the Senate to consider one of his own, of \u201csigning the death warrants\u201d of Afghan interpreters. \u201cPeople are going to die,\u201d he said on the Senate floor. \u201cThey\u2019re going to die if we don\u2019t pass this amendment and take them out of harm\u2019s way.\u201d \nIn the end, only 1,500 new visas were allocated in the 2017 National Defense Authorization Act; compared to 3,000 in the 2016 defense bill and 4,000 the year prior . \nThe 2017 debate remains in flux, according to sources on the Senate Appropriations Committee. \u201cBipartisan, bicameral talks are ongoing but I can\u2019t yet say what the final outcome may be,\u201d a committee aide said. \nAnother aide familiar with discussions said committee vice chair Patrick Leahy \u201cstrongly supports\u201d allocating more visas. \u201cHowever, the problem is the House [Republicans] and Sen. Grassley.\u201d \nA Democratic spokesperson on the House side said he couldn\u2019t \u201cget into potential outcomes,\u201d but added that the Afghan visa issue \u201cis something that we are very aware of and are looking to address.\u201d \nCocks said the State Department doesn\u2019t have control over the number of visas available, but that it believes the program helps repay Afghans who have \u201creally helped the US government.\u201d \n\u201cThese are people who have, at great personal risk, helped the US military, helped the State Department, helped our efforts overseas, and so we are committed to supporting them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to make sure that those people who have faithful and valuable service to the US can get visas to immigrate.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "chuck grassley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grassley", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mccain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeff sessions", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lucas jackson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "thom tillis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeanne shaheen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "patrick leahy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tillis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john mccain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jack reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ateeq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shaheen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "will cocks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fahim muhammad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cocks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike lee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard blumenthal", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "us military", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "3rd cavalry regiment", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harvard kennedy school review", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gop", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "judiciary committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "huffington post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taliban", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate appropriations committee", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "armed services", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate appropriations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "senate judiciary committee", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "afghanistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gamberi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laghman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "utah", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-21T19:19:06.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "67b53e9c65da293fe466b366c8b501c79b20be6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWaNyiT7s7ZFSlyLbo9_JJdx1WOWaGPzDmQHlafFwvoSppA5z7Wju.z50rc9HwRxpfZHBATR5m5.D2CZU0GVX.MmkZuNOlmkdVaWHLjAyWGGtkpq1LiGyJCWZhlstlf.C_aa5SHGaeYI.PkeZRodq5FX", "site_full": "hollywoodlife.com", "site": "hollywoodlife.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "[WATCH] Kourtney Kardashian & Scott Disick Together Again For Her Bday \u2014 Video - Hollywood Life", "title_full": "[WATCH] Kourtney Kardashian & Scott Disick Together Again For Her Bday \u2014 Video - Hollywood Life", "published": "2017-04-20T00:29:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.955, "main_image": "https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/scott-kourtney-reunite-disney-ftr.jpg?w=600&amp;h=750&amp;crop=1", "performance_score": 7, "domain_rank": 2058, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 722, "comments": 0, "shares": 722}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "67b53e9c65da293fe466b366c8b501c79b20be6c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWaNyiT7s7ZFSlyLbo9_JJdx1WOWaGPzDmQHlafFwvoSppA5z7Wju.z50rc9HwRxpfZHBATR5m5.D2CZU0GVX.MmkZuNOlmkdVaWHLjAyWGGtkpq1LiGyJCWZhlstlf.C_aa5SHGaeYI.PkeZRodq5FX", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jenna Lemoncelli", "published": "2017-04-20T00:29:00.000+03:00", "title": "[WATCH] Kourtney Kardashian & Scott Disick Together Again For Her Bday \u2014 Video - Hollywood Life", "text": "Kourtney Kardashian & Scott Disick Reunite\u2026 Kourtney Kardashian & Scott Disick Reunite For Her Bday: Back Together? \u2014 Adorable Video Wed, April 19, 2017 12:29pm EDT by Jenna Lemoncelli 2 Comments FameFlyNet 56 Photos Are they, or aren\u2019t they?!

Sumathipala made sure he stayed behind the presenters and stayed in shot while the live telecast went to air perhaps hoping he would be invited to add is two cents to the discussion. It was not only embarrassing but unbecoming of a SL cricket official. Much like his attacks on Mahela and Murali. Thankfully Channel Nine completely ignored Sumathipala and treated him like some crazed fan trying to get on camera. To put it simply it's embarrassing to see him representing Sri Lankan cricket in this manner. cricket4321 on April 19, 2017, 13:55 GMT \nThere is no dearth of talent in sri lanka. The cricket administrators should take the full responsibility for the current state of sri lankan cricket. The administrators are only trying fill up their pockets. After so many years of corruption they are still not satisfied. This is not only relevant to cricket, every sector in Sri lanka is filled with corruption. The general public knows it yet they elect them once again expecting different results. If we need to succeed in anything whole country need change their attitudes. Dchristo on April 19, 2017, 13:52 GMT \nSpot on mate. This has turned into a public fiasco now. Sanath and Thilanga are carrying out their personal agenda's with Anjelo as the public face of it. SL Cricket will be ruined with these men at the helm. cricfan1244731839 on April 19, 2017, 13:35 GMT \nthis is yahapalanaya, you voted for them! sl_supporter on April 19, 2017, 12:25 GMT \nThis is nothing new but thanks Andrew for publishing it. The cricket loving Sri Lankan public is sick to their stomach with what is going on but not in any power to do anything. But ever wondered why such a low turn out of fans in SL games? Each government pick one of their backers as SLC president who is only their to achieve their political objectives at the expense of this great game that we all loved. Even if we lose to Afganistan, I don't think these power hungry officials going to do anything about it. Keep adding more clubs Mr Sumathi. Ranatunga in previous board did a good job and Sumathi is just putting the finishing touches. SL cricket is in good hand! cricfan8085174212 on April 20, 2017, 4:31 GMT \nA very accurate analysis of the functioning (or mishandling) of the SLC. In the recent past, spot on as far as Tilanga S.'s actions, We need independant personalities of the early 1990 to administer SLC.,to get back cricket to it's glory days! Jose...P on April 20, 2017, 3:07 GMT \nDon't plant a \"money-plant\", on the wrong spot! Lest it may suck you dry! \n- \nMoney plant is one of the in-house plants lovingly kept & tended to, in many a house-hold's decorative 'flower-pots'. \nBut, try a re-planting exercise. \nYou just plant it near a coconut tree, which is almost like your national tree, You can see the money-plant, growing tall with broader & juicier leaves, clinging on & sucking out all the juice, off the national tree! If it goes unabated, it is just a matter of time, before your proud tree get sucked dry! cricfan82865468 on April 19, 2017, 19:08 GMT \nThank you Andrew. Spot on. He is a politician dooling out to his voters, clubs. He is not focused on a 4 day high level tournament or training facilities which are vital to create a pool of player who can walk into the national side at any time. It is time cointries sports minister intervenes, but he is Sumathipala's colleague in the parliament and hand in glove. So as SL cricket declines no one cares as long as he is re-elected for another term. It is time the SLC constitution is changes limiting the voting units to a single digit as in all other test playing countries and the Office bearers terms are restricted to 2 terms and never again elligible to be in the executive committee. S305 on April 19, 2017, 18:03 GMT \nHe (SLC President) reflects what the yahapalanaya has achieved: all show and talk and, nothing else. A.Jayawardene on April 19, 2017, 15:38 GMT \nYes I agree it is Yahapalanaya, you invited, so now suffer. IdontlikeitIloveit on April 19, 2017, 14:02 GMT \nWell said Andrew you are spot on!

Cricinfouser on April 19, 2017, 12:17 GMT \nWhat has this guy achieved in the sport to be elected in this position? Should be thrown out immediately--will only do good for Sri Lankan cricket. cricfan1244731839 on April 19, 2017, 11:12 GMT \nIt is incorrect for you to say that all the fans stood with Mahela & Murali. Please publish, me & others I know stood on Sumathipala's side. please publish. IshanH on April 19, 2017, 10:57 GMT \nThis man only cares about his personal interests. Does not give a damn about the game. As Thilan Samaraweera said in an interview a couple of days ago.. There are 46 opening batsmen & 23 wicket keepers (@least) in the domestic comp. It's not a healthy competition for national team positions. This is an over supply of 'under-cooked' players. If Sumathipala cares about the game.. a) Why won't he go ahead and re-structure the domestic comp to have less teams and hence a more concentrated group of players?.. b) How come he's the deputy speaker in the parliament and still holding a post in the cricket board, when ICC clearly said there shouldn't be any political influence in the game? Just a pathetic situation on the game we all love and it's sad to digest the current situation. :/ Don't get me wrong, i will still watch the Lankan team no matter what.. cricfan83520084 on April 19, 2017, 10:52 GMT \nIf anything, his toxic electioneering for ICC Chairman should bring SLC under the Foreign Ministry (at least for diplomatic reasons). It was embarassing for Sri Lankans. Even the BCCI voted to have Manohar back and SLC were out there on a limb... orangtan on April 19, 2017, 7:09 GMT \nWell said, Andrew, it is very obvious that this guy worships the groun he walks on, you are either with him or against him. To even think of criticising greats like Murali and Mahela beggars belief and I am glad that the SL fans don't buy into TS's garbage. But Mr. Jayasuriya moves with the swing and is obviously close to TS. Udendra on April 19, 2017, 6:54 GMT \nThis isn't actually anything new. Most Sri Lankans know it. I may be wrong, but glad that a Cricinfo journalist finally sheds some light on this. sachin438 on April 19, 2017, 6:16 GMT \nThere are 23 clubs. That equates to 253 players. Now consider that the national team players are almost never available to play in the Premier League tournament, and that most of the time there is either an A-team or Emerging/U23 team tour. So the best 30 players are often missing. How are players supposed to improve, when every team is mediocre. The standard of first-class cricket is also one of the reasons there is such high turnover of players in the national setup. Most players simply aren't good enough to play at the next level, which makes sense because they play in such a weak domestic competition. Slankanfan on April 19, 2017, 5:39 GMT \nUnder this man's watch Sri Lanka has fallen to its lowest levels at international cricket. Having been whitewashed by SA and then beaten by Bangladesh in all three formats. Sadly there is no proper short term or a long term plan to improve the game. Kasunmanu on April 19, 2017, 4:44 GMT \nSadly this is the truth and none of these guys have the desire to do something good for Sri lanka cricket and only do good for themselves. First thing Thilanga did after elected was to throw away the proposed Zonal tournament by Mahela. Public has ignored him and yet he cant understand that. I cant see anyone comes from this system will do any good other than pleasing the club owners. \nNo featured comments at the moment.

Ultimate Guide To 'Star Wars 8: The Last Jedi': News, Trailer, Cast & All You Need To Know \nFirst we hear that Take That frontman Gary Barlow has nabbed himself a role, and now it is the British Royal Family's turn. There has been a persistent rumor since last year that Prince William and Prince Harry will cameo in the film as Stormtroopers. When recently quizzed on the theory, Johnson didn't really do much to deny the news. A Royal Appointment \nIt all stems from a high-profile visit from Kensington Palace to the set of #TheLastJedi in April 2016. Conspiracy theorists also thought that the brothers managed to find time to suit-up as Stormtroopers and slip in a quick cameo before heading back to Buckingham Palace. Johnson has never actually denied it, so Yahoo! Moviesthought they would ask him themselves. \nSpeaking at #StarWars Celebration, Johnson couldn't help but hold back laughter. Smiling while pretending that he was receiving a transmission, Johnson teased: \n\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. I have no clue. The last voice you heard \u2026 I can neither confirm nor deny.\u201d \nIf the heirs to the throne are in Episode VIII , don't expect it to be a part of much significance. You may remember that #SimonPegg got himself a small speaking role as Unkar Plutt in The Force Awakens and #DanielCraig featured as the Stormtrooper who freed Rey. \nSee also: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "william and prince harry cameos", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "william", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "rian johnson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "adam driver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "harry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john boyega", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom chapman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark hamill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laura dern", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gary barlow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daisy ridley", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "british royal family", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benicio del toro", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "kensington palace", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buckingham palace", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-20T07:27:47.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "80ecbcd31f97e58be100047dc2b588332c4cc59c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9C71mqddeZjT4eCt4HUTLUuC42i2UvipYm6D4YW.355n6u4NVELyYl8q.qiL6p7RR27ra2GHkByohQ9IZVQtPDHezsLyFYoo2u8azTUU1P_UI7tgUW6v3C5FU.Jc9YaI7KC8Aj3V1wqw--", "site_full": "www.elle.com", "site": "elle.com", "site_section": "http://www.elle.com/rss/all.xml", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Latest Content - ELLE", "title": "Kim Kardashian Named 4 Kylie Lip Kit Colors After Herself", "title_full": "Kim Kardashian Named 4 Kylie Lip Kit Colors After Herself", "published": "2017-04-20T03:55:35.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://ell.h-cdn.co/assets/17/16/980x490/gallery-1492606479-hbz-kim-kylie-index.jpg", "performance_score": 7, "domain_rank": 2563, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 709, "comments": 0, "shares": 709}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "80ecbcd31f97e58be100047dc2b588332c4cc59c", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9C71mqddeZjT4eCt4HUTLUuC42i2UvipYm6D4YW.355n6u4NVELyYl8q.qiL6p7RR27ra2GHkByohQ9IZVQtPDHezsLyFYoo2u8azTUU1P_UI7tgUW6v3C5FU.Jc9YaI7KC8Aj3V1wqw--", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-04-20T03:55:35.000+03:00", "title": "Kim Kardashian Named 4 Kylie Lip Kit Colors After Herself", "text": "BY ALYSSA BAILEY After precisely one day of mystery , Kylie Jenner has unveiled what\u2019s in her and Kim Kardashian\u2019s KKW x Kylie makeup collaboration on Snapchat.

Whilst it\u2019s received a lot of praise for its diversity , for flipping the silent dead-girl trope , and for its overarching message to be kinder to others, there is a growing number of people who are criticising the show\u2019s troubling portrayal of youth suicide and the risk it poses to vulnerable viewers. \nIf you haven\u2019t watched it, 13 Reasons Why is about the suicide of teenager Hannah Baker, who records a series of 13 tapes before she dies, detailing why she blames certain people for her death. She intends for the tapes to be passed from person to person, so each can understand the full story and the impact they had on her life \u2013 and death. We primarily view events through the character of Clay, a friend of Hannah\u2019s who, already struggling with her death, receives the tapes and has to grapple with the brutal revelations about her experiences, and the idea that he was part of the problem in her eyes. \nAfter listening to the tapes, Clay comes to the conclusion, \u201cIt has to get better. The way we treat each other and look out for each other\u2026 it has to get better.\u201d The intended message \u2013 and the one many fans are focusing on \u2013 is clear. Be kind. You could save a life. Share \nIt\u2019s a noble idea, but unfortunately it\u2019s embedded in a show that doesn\u2019t effectively explore mental health and that ultimately uses suicide as the catalyst for a revenge fantasy. Rather than a nuanced exploration of the complex reasons people kill themselves, experts say 13 Reasons Why presents a rather simplistic blame game, dangerously reinforcing the incorrect idea that suicide is the only way you can truly be heard, or that it can be used as a tool to make those who have hurt you suffer. \nKristen Douglas, a spokesperson for Australian youth mental health organisation Headspace , told BuzzFeed that the framing device of Hannah\u2019s \u201creasons\u201d is harmful and unrealistic. \u201cShe\u2019s telling the story in a way that means she\u2019s getting resolution about her suicide, and that\u2019s not a reality. If young people die by suicide it\u2019s very final; you don\u2019t get to see the reaction of people, you don\u2019t get to see the reaction of bullies, you don\u2019t get to be involved in your own funeral. Sadly, I think young people sometimes don\u2019t always fully understand the finality of death. You don\u2019t get resolution about that.\u201d \nWhile Selena Gomez, who is an executive producer on the series, revealed in the show\u2019s behind-the-scenes special, Beyond the Reasons, that she wanted to adapt 13 Reasons Why to help people, \u201cbecause suicide should never be an option\u201d, Douglas explained that the show actually risks suggesting the opposite. \n\u201cIf you\u2019re a young person viewing this content, feeling entrapped, bullied, like things aren\u2019t going to get better, like, \u2018I wish I could tell these people to stop, they don\u2019t know how far they\u2019re pushing me\u2019\u2026 this all of a sudden becomes a very real option,\u201d she said. \nAside from the plot itself, experts claim the show also puts people at risk through its incredibly graphic and drawn-out depiction of the act of suicide (there are also multiple graphic rape scenes ). The creators of the show have repeatedly defended this decision, saying that it was intended to make people uncomfortable and to show the painful and irreversible consequences of suicide. \n\u201cWe worked very hard not to be gratuitous, but we did want it to be painful to watch because we wanted to be very clear that there is nothing in any way worthwhile about suicide,\u201d executive producer Brian Yorkey said in Beyond the Reasons. In an open letter , he elaborated on this sentiment, saying that experts were consulted to ensure the show accurately depicted the \u201chow\u201d and the \u201cwhy\u201d. Meanwhile, writer Nic Scheff has released a statement saying he wanted the suicide scene to be as graphic and realistic as possible, because he thought it would save lives.

(Warning: Spoilers!) Posted on Share \nClay Jensen (Dylan Minnette) and Jeff Atkins (Brandon Larracuente) at the school dance on 13 Reasons Why . \nIt didn't take long for the 13 Reasons Why fandom to agree on one thing about the new Netflix series: Jeff Atkins deserved better . \nThe character, played by 22-year-old actor Brandon Larracuente, is a jock at Liberty High School who befriends Clay Jensen (Dylan Minnette), his classmate and tutor. Jeff is not a main character on the series and appears in fewer scenes than the rest of the cast, but his untimely death in 13 Reasons Why devastated viewers. \n\u201cI\u2019m going to quote a meme that I saw: Jeff was just an innocent boy who wants to play baseball, get his grades up, and help Clay with women,\u201d Larracuente told BuzzFeed News of his beloved character. \u201cThat\u2019s it, that\u2019s all he wanted to do. He was an innocent soul.\u201d Share \nBrandon Larracuente \nJeff is arguably one of the only decent high schoolers at Liberty High. Instead of bullying, he takes a vested interest in Clay\u2019s happiness and well-being. Their relationship transcends the school library where they meet for tutoring; yes, Clay helps Jeff with his schoolwork, but Jeff helps Clay with his dating life and social skills. \n\u201cIt\u2019s so easy to follow the crowd and become a follower, just like everybody else who was against Clay, but it takes a bold person not to,\u201d Larracuente said of Jeff. \"It\u2019s cool to be cool, but it\u2019s even cooler to stick up for people who don\u2019t have a voice.\" \nWhile Jeff\u2019s storyline is an adored part of the Netflix series, his character does not exist in Jay Asher's original novel, which the show is based on. That gave Larracuente a unique opportunity to shape Jeff and \u201cmold him into whatever he wanted him to be.\u201d \n\u201cWhen I was developing Jeff, I just pretended like it was me going through Clay\u2019s experiences and did what I\u2019d wanted somebody to do for me: stick up for me,\u201d the actor said. \"I could see myself in Clay.\" Having also been bullied when he was younger, Larracuente drew on his real-life experiences. \"I\u2019ve been there in those instances where you don\u2019t just know what to do. You know what you want to do, you know what\u2019s right, but your heart gets in the way or your fear gets in the way,\" he said. \u201cI was bullied to an extent in high school and growing up. I knew what it felt like to feel like you\u2019re alone and like the world is against you. \u2026 Any scenes when Clay was doubting himself were kind of difficult for me.\" \nLarracuente didn\u2019t have any hesitations about getting involved with the series because of \u201cthe message and what it stood for.\u201d Share \nJeff getting tutored by Clay. \n\u201cThis is something that I want to be a part of because it\u2019s such a strong and sensitive topic that I feel like many people try to sugarcoat,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is real-life stuff that\u2019s happening every day. \nPlaying the role of Jeff Atkins has catapulted Larracuente into the spotlight more than ever before, but the New York native who moved to Florida at the age of 10 is no stranger to the acting world. In addition to appearing in some minor roles on TV shows like Nickelodeon\u2019s Every Witch Way and NBC\u2019s Constantine , Larracuente also played Ben Rayburn on Bloodline, another Netflix original series. Ben is the son of leading character John Rayburn (Kyle Chandler). But that was all before he became everyone\u2019s favorite character on 13 Reasons Why . \nOn the series, Jeff gently nudges Clay along, asking him to fill out the \"Oh My Dollar\" Valentine\u2019s Day survey that could lead to a date, and encouraging him to go to the school dance. He even pushes Clay to be more forward with Hannah (Katherine Langford) and helps him attempt to get closer to possibly eventually date her. \nBut from the beginning, Larracuente knew his character's fate: Jeff is killed in a car accident. \u201cIt was bittersweet,\u201d the actor remembered. \u201cI looked at it like, \u2018OK, how do I make my impact before my death?\u2019 I served my purpose on this Earth, on this show, before my time was done.\u201d \nThe fatal night begins when Jeff attends a party and goes out for a beer run. He reassures Clay that he only had \u201ctwo beers two hours ago\u201d and had been drinking soda ever since. Viewers eventually discover that another classmate, Sheri (Ajiona Alexus), hits a stop sign on her way home and knocks it down on what ends up being the same corner where Jeff gets into the car accident that ends his life.

Illustration \nCongratulations are in order for Serena Williams , but for more than it seems. \nFirst, the obvious. The tennis star announced yesterday, via a quickly-vanishing Snapchat, that she is expecting a baby with fianc\u00e9 Alex Ohanian. We'll pause here for the obligatory slow claps and champagne pops. Beyond the incredibly happy baby news, this new milestone marks the culmination of a full romantic turnaround for Williams. It wasn't long ago that she was embroiled in the tabloid drama that comes with associating with none other than Drake . Yet, in barely more than a year, she started a journey to complete happiness that is (almost) as impressive as her many Grand Slam wins. \nLet's start at the beginning. Drake and Williams were first outed as a rumored couple in August 2015, when they were photographed getting cozy in a Cincinnati restaurant. Drake had previously been spotting sitting courtside at one of her tennis matches, which stirred a bit of speculation, but it wasn't until the prophetic paparazzi photos dropped that the rumors about the twosome really ramped up. Photos \nSerena Williams' Best Looks \nDrake and Williams had been friends for quite some time, and at the time of the Great Cincinnati Cuddle-Off E! News learned that they had been dating for about a month. The relationship was instant tabloid fodder and the Twitterverse, naturally, exploded. From that point on pretty much nothing that they did as a couple could be kept a secret. \nAccording to E!'s sources, they initially tried to keep a low profile as they were both \"private people when it came to their personal lives,\" but it didn't work out well at all. It was, for lack of a better term, a media circus for the ages. \nThey were photographed together everywhere they went, from his restaurant opening in Toronto to dates out on the town to front row at her New York Fashion Week show. Perhaps the most infamous example was the 2015 US Open semifinal match, an egregious case of the entire public totally missing the point. Drake was seated front row at the big match\u2014as any supposed boyfriend would do\u2014but the second that Drizzy was spotted in the house, attention immediately shifted to the rapper and his relationship with Williams. \nThe tennis star ended up losing that tournament in straight sets (that's tennis speak for a very bad match), and fans immediately accused Drake of distracting her. The rumors and accusations went flying\u2014as did the hashtags\u2014in half-joking, half-serious manners, but it was all absurd nonetheless. So absurd, in fact, that over a year later Serena felt compelled to address it in a cover interview for Glamour . \nThen, in almost as much of a surprise fashion as the Drake-Serena relationship began, the two were done. Over. Kaput. As anyone who's had a Hollywood breakup will tell you, being constantly followed and critiqued in a relationship does not a sustainable coupling make. Sadly for Williams, it wasn't the first time she had learned such a lesson. Her previous relationship with rapper Common had been splashed across the front pages of every glossy in the grocery aisle, and their ensuing dramatic breakup was even more widespread. \nBut there was almost no time to mourn for Serena, because she had met someone new. And this time it was a guy that she (and everyone else) could take seriously. \nEnter Alexis Ohanian . Make that: Enter in secret . \nSince the tennis player and the Reddit co-founder got together, they have been operating in the exact opposite fashion from what we'd come to expect from one of the sports world's biggest stars. They never made an official \"we're dating\" announcement. They were (almost) never photographed together. In fact, the only reason anyone even knew they were together from the start is on account of their friend's overly chatty tendencies.

I realized pretty quickly that I wasn\u2019t cut out for party politics, but that I did love the challenge of policymaking.

I know we were all heartened to see the huge turnout around the Women\u2019s March in the U.S., and I\u2019d love to see increased support for the UN\u2019s global efforts to get men more involved in pushing for gender parity in education, work, politics, healthcare and other areas.\u201d\nHow do you think the Trump presidency is going? \u201cLet\u2019s just say that the first 100 days have not allayed my concerns about the Administration\u2019s policies or their ability to carry them out effectively, particularly on national security. But for all our sakes, I have to hope they figure it out.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s a goal of yours for the next year? \u201cErlingur and I are overjoyed that we\u2019re expecting our first baby in late July.

When they arrived, officers arrested her son for an incident that happened in October, during which John Benjamin had kicked and scratched his educational assistant. The Haygood family weren\u2019t notified that John Benjamin had an outstanding warrant for battery involving a school employee. \nIn the video, taken by Luanne, John Benjamin sits slumped in a chair as Okeechobee County deputies reach for his hands, Luanne asking from behind the camera, \u201cDoes he have the same rights as an adult?\u201d \nJohn Benjamin then proceeds to tell the deputies, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be touched, I don\u2019t like to be touched,\u201d crying, as he puts his hands in the air in futility. \n\u201cIt\u2019s so fucking dumb, momma,\u201d John Benjamin says. \u201cIt\u2019s all their fucking fault!\u2026I didn\u2019t know I was going to go get arrested like this.\u201d One of the deputies cuffs his hands, then the other proceeds to escort the 10-year-old out of the school building and into a cop car. \nWhen Luanne asks to ride with her son to the police station, the officers tell her no. She asks for documentation, or an explanation for the arrest, and the officers decline. She explains that John Benjamin is autistic and scared, but the officers say he\u2019s going to be fine. According to the Post , Luanne\u2019s son spent the night locked up at a juvenile facility. \nJohn Benjamin\u2019s mother posted the video to Facebook , where it went viral. She\u2019s since taken it down. \nLuanne told the Post that John Benjamin had been diagnosed with autism two years ago and had an individual education plan, but was having issues with his assistant. He claimed she was hurting him, but the school wouldn\u2019t reassign him a new assistant. \nThen, on Oct. 27, John Benjamin kicked, scratched, and punched his assistant, after being told to go to timeout. The assistant had attempted to move him and had to restrain John Benjamin by wrapping his arms around the child\u2019s upper chest, according to documents. It\u2019s unknown why Luanne and the family weren\u2019t informed. \nProsecutor Ashley Albright is meeting with the educator who is pressing charges against John Benjamin, but said the State Attorney\u2019s Office will take his autism into consideration in deciding how to proceed with the case. \nAutism Society of America President Scott Badesh told the Post that the organization is in contact with the Haygood family to assist with services and legal counsel.

The option would be opt-in, and it would remove any and all \u201cunacceptable\u201d ads as defined by Coalition for Better Ads industry group . Those types of ads include pop-up ads, autoplay videos, and what are known as prestitial ads, or those ads that are often fullscreen and show up before you\u2019re taken to the homepage or desired website. \nGoogle wouldn\u2019t be blocking its own ads How Google will implement this feature is still being debated, the report says. One option includes blocking all advertising on a website if it includes even just one offending ad, which would ensure that website owners keep all forms of advertising up to standard. The other option is simply to block the offending ads in question, though it\u2019s unclear whether Google will go forth with either strategy. Google declined to comment for this story.\nIt may sound counterintuitive for a corporation whose entire business pretty much depends on internet advertising to consider an ad-blocking feature in the world\u2019s most popular web browser. However, Google has a vested interest in ensuring web users don\u2019t turn to third-party ad-blocking tools that don\u2019t differentiate between acceptable and unacceptable ads by industry standards and, in some cases, charge website owners money to bypass ad-blocking filters, effectively defeating the purpose of using ad-blocking plugins in the first place. \nThe company has a history of disallowing or preventing what it sees as harmful ad practices, like blocking pop-ups in new tabs and issuing malware warnings. So in a way, Google appears to be taking additional steps to clean up advertising bad practices and keep users happy, even if it means throwing a healthy chunk of the lower-end ad market under the bus. \nUpdate at 7:54PM ET, 4/19: Added that Google declined to comment.", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "google", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "coalition for better ads", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-20T03:05:54.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "2a6d8eb796b09239c43019d989d3a522be8deb10", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRULI3Cl7YN6x1S4FCvs99G9dJ0Z64Z1yzslaUPtb1qGg1yFnnk.pD0h2_zWyxCG0w-", "site_full": "www.buzzfeed.com", "site": "buzzfeed.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/buzzfeed/UteY", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "BuzzFeed - Latest", "title": "41 People Share Exactly How They Orgasmed For The First Time", "title_full": "41 People Share Exactly How They Orgasmed For The First Time", "published": "2017-04-20T17:24:34.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-04/17/16/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/original-2908-1492460305-14.jpg?crop=1194:625;0,0", "performance_score": 6, "domain_rank": 137, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 642, "comments": 8, "shares": 642}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "pinterest": {"shares": 4}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "2a6d8eb796b09239c43019d989d3a522be8deb10", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRULI3Cl7YN6x1S4FCvs99G9dJ0Z64Z1yzslaUPtb1qGg1yFnnk.pD0h2_zWyxCG0w-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "", "published": "2017-04-20T17:24:34.000+03:00", "title": "41 People Share Exactly How They Orgasmed For The First Time", "text": "Health Here's How People Actually Orgasm BuzzFeed asked people to share what it took to finally make them orgasm. Here are their open and honest answers. Posted on Share \nOrgasms can be tricky. Not only do they not teach How To Get Off 101 in sex ed, but it can also take a lot of experimenting to find out exactly what your body responds to and what you need in order to orgasm. To show that there's no one-size-fits-all path to orgasming, BuzzFeed asked people of all ages, genders, and sexualities to describe their first noteworthy orgasms. Here are just some of the responses: 1. \n\"I had been with a lot of guys, but it never felt right. They never made an effort to make it good for me. I had been secretly in love with my best friend (a girl) for years, but I was afraid of judgement from my family and afraid of rejection. Finally I had the nerve to tell her how I felt and on our first night together, she gave me seven amazing, mind-blowing orgasms. It was an earth shattering night and here we are, five years later, happily married with a house and all our pets and still those mind-blowing orgasms.\" \n\u201423/Female/Lesbian 2. \n\"I have to have my asshole licked. Seriously, I won't be able to come unless there is some tongue action in the backdoor. The first time I had sex involved my former partner sucking my dick (technically enlarged clit from testosterone) and it was going on for what seemed like an hour (with breaks to jerk me off) so they took me be surprise and licked my asshole and I almost came immediately! So now I am very into butt stuff.\" \n\u201419/Trans male/Bisexual 3. \n\"I was laying in my bunk bed on my iPod touch. I was 13 and confused about my sexuality. I started watching videos of guys kissing and began touching my erection. I didn't really know what was going on, but eventually I felt this intense pleasure. About 20 minutes later, I did it again.\" \n\u201422/Male/Gay Share 4. \n\"After 10 years of marriage and never having an orgasm, I found myself single again. A friend told me I needed to discover who I was again, including sexually. I ordered a dildo online and as a free gift, they sent a small finger vibrator too. Thinking nothing of it, I put the vibrator aside. I tried to explore with the dildo, but an orgasm never seemed to reveal itself to me. In a moment of desperation I tried the vibrator on my clit and OMG. I will never forget the feeling of my whole body seizing up with pleasure. It took me a few minutes to recover. But from then on out, clit stimulation has been the only way I can orgasm. But I'm not complaining.\" \n\u201426/Female/Bi 5. \n\"I was in high school and my older sister surprised me with a vibrator. Was using it over my underwear for the first time because of how sensitive I was. I was not expecting much to happen. BOOM. Instantaneous orgasm. I. Did. Not. Stop. Masturbating. For. The. Rest. Of. The. Damn. Night.\" \n\u201426/Female/Bi 6. \n\"I thought I was immune. I have an extremely insensitive body and from second base to oral, none of it stimulated me in the way most people described it. Sex was okay \u2014 albeit a little meh \u2014 for me until I got my first boyfriend. One night I decided to try dirty talking, which really turned him and, strangely enough, turned ME on in a way physical stimulation never did. Things got hot and heavy but through it all, I was the one in control, teasing him, making him work for it. I'm not sure exactly why or how, but the psychological power trip and feeling wanted were what did it for me and that was the night I had my first orgasm.\" \n\u201418/Female/Bisexual 7. \n\"Oral sex. He hummed while doing it, which created extra vibration and I had my first orgasm.\" \n\u201441/Female/Straight 8. \n\"The first seriously intense orgasm I had was when I was with my ex. I had never bottomed before we got together, so the whole thing was new to me. I was riding him and he hit my prostate just right and I came hands free. It's a completely different sensation from normally masturbating. I thought I would never stop convulsing.\" \n\u201426/Male/Gay Share 9. \n\"When I was younger and started to jack off, I would never come. I would sit there for what seemed like forever just wasting lotion (though my dick was the most moisturized body part on anyone west of the Mississippi). It wasn't until I started to spread my legs and played with my perineum and ass that I would not only come, but literally empty out.\" \n\u201427/Male/Gay 10. \n\"My first orgasm was fricking great and a little embarrassing. I had a girlfriend over and we were making out and things got a little serious. We slipped into the shower for a hot makeout sesh and there was some fingering, and she was a bit older than me so she was GOOD at it. I climaxed, collapsed onto the floor, and knocked myself unconscious on the edge of the tub. I woke up to a throbbing headache and a handsome EMT guy trying to help my naked ass stand up. We are good friends now, but I ended up with a concussion and that girl ditched me after she called 911. Never heard from her again, but I have a new awesome friend and a great story about my first orgasm.\" \n\u201421/Cis Female/Pan 11. \n\"l have to have clitoral stimulation. Penetration feels really nice at first, but eventually it doesn't feel like anything. The first time I used vibrations on my clit was insane. I used a (clean) electric toothbrush and after 30 seconds I was squirting. I had no idea what was happening and I thought I had peed! Turns out that's kinda normal. The orgasm itself was decent, but I was covered in fluids. It was crazy.\" \n\u201418/Female/Bisexual 12. \n\"I was 18 and working at a restaurant. A coworker and I had been crushing hard on each other. We had never gotten together and one night a group of guy coworkers were going to go clubbing. He let me know he was coming to my place after they were done. He came prepped with condoms and Gatorade, which at the time seemed like a strange combo. He was very active and the sex was incredible. The mattress ended up half off my bed with me awkwardly positioned on the box spring. He was penetrating me and that's when I realized, it's about to happen, I'm going to have an orgasm . \nWe both came at the same time and really needed the Gatorade afterwards.\" \n\u201432/Female/Straight 13. \n\"I was probably about 10 years old and was laying down napping in the back of an RV. The vibration of my thighs from the movement of the vehicle started to feel really nice and I remember moving my body along with it until suddenly I orgasmed. Of course I had no idea what had happened, but let's just say I was a fan of car-ride napping from then on.\" \n\u201438/Female/Bisexual 14. \n\"The first time I had a orgasm was when I was taking a bath, I used the shower head. I wasn\u2019t planning on having an orgasm (because at that time I didn\u2019t know how) but it felt so good and then, BAM. It just happened and it felt AMAZING! \nAfter that I took a lot of showers.\" \n\u201424/Female/Straight 15. \n\"My girlfriend sat on top of me last year and held a vibrator to me until I came. Was never able to get off before then. Sometimes that's the only way I still can.\" \n\u201419/Trans male/Straight Share 16. \n\"I lost my virginity seven months ago, but it wasn't until a few weeks ago when I ordered a vibrating dildo that I experienced my first mind-blowing orgasm. It felt different than the orgasms I had had with my partner and it left me completely satisfied and speechless for a couple minutes afterward. Ladies, explore your options! Who knows what you might discover!\" \n\u201422/Female/Heterosexual 17. \n\"I had taken a pot edible and felt incredibly sensitive down there during a shower. Started playing around and it was the most amazing feeling in the world.\" \n\u201421/Female/Hetero 18. \n\"I don't have an interest in sex, but I do masturbate from time to time. I used to only use clitoral stimulation because I was kinda scared of pain, but one day I tried to finger myself with another couple fingers on my clit and I had my first BIG orgasm.\" \n\u201420/Female/Asexual 19. \n\"I was a young and eager learner. I had a major back surgery when I was twelve that left me bedridden for almost a month. I was staying with my grandmother who was very much a part of the local church. Well, her bible study felt bad for me having to be stuck in bed, so they all chipped in and bought me a mini laptop. Long story short, within a day I was feeling myself to porn I had found. I discovered the clitoris and never looked back. Thanks, church ladies!\" \n\u201418/Female/Bisexual 20. \n\"Well, it was an accident. You know how some people can have orgasms from certain workouts and yoga? So now imagine a younger me doing some more advanced yoga and then, wham! I get this tingly awesome feeling. I didn't realize it at the time but once I got home (yes, I was in a studio) my underwear was a mess and realized, I just was sort of masturbating. I haven't done yoga in public since.\" \n\u201418/Female/Ace 21. \n\"I was really naive growing up, so much to the point I didn't know how to masturbate. Well, upon getting my first boyfriend who popped my cherry, he was surprised to find I didn't even know how to masturbate. He ended up behind me, guiding me on the process and when I orgasmed, it was the biggest shock of my life. I sat there bewildered that I could have been experiencing this for years. So yeah, my first orgasm was him teaching me to masturbate.\" \n\u201421/Female/Straight 22. \n\"I was probably in 10th (maybe 11th?) grade and I had bruise on my hip from bumping into a table or something. So there I was in bed, reading explicit (and probably Avengers ) fanfiction, and my laptop kept digging into that bruise while I was rubbing myself. It was fantastic, euphoric. I'm finally to the point now that I can orgasm without being in pain but it's still definitely the quickest route.\" \n\u201419/Queer Share 23. \n\"Shockingly enough it was when I lost my virginity! In a last ditch effort to come, I decided to ride him even though my legs were killing me from working out. I have to say it was the best choice I'd made all week. I found the best angle and I worked for it. It was pretty awesome but I couldn't even stand up afterwards. Riding him is a lot of work!\" \n\u201419/Female/Bi 24. \n\"I can simply say, my heart needs to be open before my body is. I was frustrated for years because I had such a difficult time having an orgasm, but now I accept that about myself that for me, sex is deeply emotional, so having a strong heart connection is the most important factor to my having an orgasm. If I am alone, I basically think about someone I love to make it work, but mostly masturbation bores me.\" \n\u201444/Female/Fluid 25. \n\"When I was in high school, we had HBO on the living room TV. I would stay up later than my mom and sister, and watch Real Sex on the lowest volume. I wouldn't touch myself for fear that they would pop out around the corner and see. Instead, I squeezed my abs and did Kegels in succession until I orgasmed. It's still my favorite way to come.\" \n\u201430/Female/Straight 26. \n\"The first notable orgasm that I had with a partner was when I was 19. I had been seeing a girl for a few weeks and we were at her house alone, so one thing led to another and she started going down on me. It was incredible. I can't remember how long it lasted, but it couldn't have been long before I came.\" \n\u201427/Male/Straight 27. \n\"I was 27 years old when I had my first orgasm. I was able to manually stimulate myself to get close but could never go over. My long-distance boyfriend convinced me to buy a Pocket Rocket and 'walked' me through using it over the phone...you know, applying different types of pressure in different places, moving it to various parts of the clitoris instead of straight on, etc. The orgasm took me COMPLETELY by surprise. I felt like there wasn't even a warning. I just started screaming, 'Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god,\" over and over again for a couple of minutes. My throat was sore by the time it was over, I had dropped the phone, and all I wanted was a blessedly-long nap.\" \n\u201444/F/Heterosexual 28. \n\"Sometimes I feel like the only one who prefers this for an orgasm, but P-in-V is the best way to get an orgasm for me. Oral sex has always been just meh for me. My clit is just too sensitive for that to be as enjoyable and the orgasm isn't as intense and rarely happens. When I figured out the right position to G-spot orgasm, OMG! The first time my boyfriend at the time and I tried doggy style, I got there, multiple times. I find that either that, or lying on my stomach puts my partner and I in position for the best orgasm for me.\" \n\u201434/Female/Straight Share 29. \n\"While inside my boyfriend, I told him to play with my nipples when he wanted me to come. At the right moment he reached out with both hands and stimulates my nipples simultaneously and it sent me over the edge instantly. To this day he always knows he has a 'go switch' when we are having sex.\" \n\u201434/Male/Gay 30. \n\"When I was 14, I masturbated for the first time to some really bad gay porn on the home computer after school. It was taking forever and I thought I was doing the wrong thing, but all of a sudden I felt it coming and needless to say, 14 years of jizz went everywhere. I thought I broke my dick.\" \n\u201427/Male/Gay 31. \n\"In order to achieve a mind-blowing orgasm, I need to be face down with my legs straight and with clitoral stimulation. I'll usually ride a guy, straighten my legs (so I'm lying down on top of him). Occasionally I can achieve an orgasm if we're having sex from behind while I lie face down on the bed while he stimulates my clitoris. But legs have to be straight!\" \n\u201424/Woman/Straight 32. \n\"I get in my head when I'm with a partner, and even though I can get myself off easily, I think too hard when a guy is trying to get me off. I got really drunk with my childhood friend once and we had sex, and he was able to make me come. I think it was the combination of lowered inhibitions from alcohol and being with someone I completely trusted that allowed me to (finally) come with another person.\" \n\u201422/Female/Straight 33. \n\"I wasn't able to orgasm until late into my college years. I had been dating my then-boyfriend for quite a few months and although the sex was fun, he could never quite get me there. That was until I watched him dance with another girl at a club. I had never been cheated on or anything close, so watching them grind got me incredibly jealous, but surprisingly aroused. We had sex like animals that night and the thought of them grinding raced through my brain the whole time and I found myself having my very first true and intense orgasm. It is now a major part of all my fantasies.\" \n\u201432/Female/Straight 34. \n\"So I've been on antidepressants since before I started really trying to have an orgasm. In particular, an antidepressant that makes it notoriously hard to come. Like, really hard. So, I finally took a step when I went away to college and bought myself a vibrator. It took a little practice, but when I got there, boy did I get there. It was a good one and it's only gotten better since!\" \n\u201419/Female/Bisexual Share 35. \n\"I was fingered by my girlfriend at the time. I don't have amazing, hardcore orgasms \u2014 more like the kind that ebb and flow over time then leave me weak at the knees and grinning from ear to ear. It took me a while to figure out that it was actually an orgasm. I usually need plenty of clit play and G-spot stimulation and a partner who is in tune with my needs and gender identity.\" \n\u201419/Trans Man/Bisexual 36. \n\"My wife and I waited 'til the wedding night. And we were both virgins. It was my first time seeing a woman completely naked romantically, and same for her with a man. Not sure how it happened really, but we both came together during first intercourse. It was pretty special \u2014 serendipitous, one could say.\" \n\u201432/M/Straight 37. \n\"Took until I was 28. I had a conservative religious upbringing. I lost my virginity at 24. In general, I learned that it was just a matter of relaxing, which I mean mostly from a mental standpoint but also physically. Even though I wasn't fully aware of it, I was very uncomfortable with any expression of my own sexuality throughout my adolescence and into my 20s. I didn't even masturbate. The first few times I had sex (with women; hadn't figured out I was bi yet), I didn't come. I reached orgasm for the first time while masturbating \u2014 something that happened very late in the game for me! First time I came with a partner was with a guy going down on me. Interestingly, my experiences with men helped me reach a level of comfort where I could orgasm with both male and female partners.\" \n\u201430/Male/Bisexual 38. \n\"I'd been having sex for five years when I had my first real orgasm. I'd just given up on it ever happening and assumed there was something wrong with me. I bought the Womanizer off of Amazon on a whim and that thing honestly changed my life. It took some serious patience and exploration to figure out what does it for me, but now I can reliably get myself off with just about anything so long as I have about 30 minutes of clitoral stimulation.\" \n\u201426/Non-binary/Bisexual 39. \n\"Penetrative intercourse has always been difficult for me to enjoy. I have vaginismus and after having several guys dismiss my actual medical problem by saying it was just an excuse for me to refuse sex with them, my first boyfriend came along and he was very understanding. He did his best to communicate with me and make sure I wasn't in any sort of pain but was enjoying myself. My first orgasm was through cunnilingus. Despite us both being rather inexperienced in the bedroom, he was surprisingly very good at going downtown. He got the job done and for the first time, I felt like even if my sexual experiences would have to be handled with care, I could still have a fulfilling physical relationship with my partner.\" \n\u201421/Female/Heterosexual 40. \n\"The first time I had an orgasm was completely by accident. I was watching Nip/Tuck which was one of the raunchiest shows I had ever seen at that age. I decided to get a snack.

Nerd out with me on Twitter, comrades: @alishagrauso \nOf all the Marvel films in development, perhaps none has had more riding on it or been more elusive with details than #CaptainMarvel . \nAfter the casting of Brie Larson as the titular character, not much has been forthcoming about the flick, but finally, Marvel has announced that it's tapped its directors\u2014yes, \"directors,\" as in two. \nVariety is reporting that Mississippi Grind directing duo Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck will be the ones to pilot Carol Danvers into her first adventures in the MCU. Credit: BossLogic \nIt appears the pair have brought something special to the table to land the gig\u2014 #Marvel made it clear after Larson's casting that it was just fine taking its time searching for the right director, particularly as it was adamant it wanted the script to be solid before taking the next step. The studio also specified that it was especially keen to have a female director at the helm, considering this will be Marvel's first female-led superhero film. \nFor those of you fans scratching your heads and going, \"Who the hell are those guys?,\" don't forget\u2014you'd likely never heard of James Gunn or the Russo brothers before they made some of your favorite Marvel films to date. We can expect it will be no less the case here. The studio reportedly met with Boden and Fleck a handful of times before officially offering the job, an indicator that they're really happy with the vision that the pair had for the character of Captain Marvel and how to integrate her into the #MCU . \nAnd it's very cool that, in front and behind the camera, this is going to be a female-powered flick. Carol Danvers is the very definition of a kickass female inside and out. With #BrieLarson taking on the role, Boden directing, and screenwriting team Meg LeFauve and Nicole Perlman behind the script, we can expect this movie to do justice to Captain Marvel\u2014just as she deserves. \nCaptain Marvel hits theaters on March 8, 2019.

He absolutely adores those [comic books].\" \nDespite containing quite a lot of epic comic book imagery , Batman v Superman didn't really feel like a comic book movie , so this new description gives me further hope that Snyder might really get it right this time. \nJustice League is actually looking like a mini Game Of Thrones reunion at this point, between Roose Bolton, Mance Rayder (Ciar\u00e1n Hinds, who plays Steppenwolf in JL ) and of course Khal Drogo, slipping on a wet suit and pretending to be Aquaman \u2014 and that's absolutely fine by me. \nJustice League hits theaters November 17.

[1] The series is a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle, epitomized by its family of the same name: Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield, named for the town in Oregon [11] ; however, the state the show takes place in is never revealed (this is one of the show\u2019s running gags). The show parodies American culture, society, television and many aspects of the human condition. History \nThe family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with the producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19th, 1987. After a three-season run, the cartoon was developed into a half-hour primetime show and was an early hit for FOX , becoming the network\u2019s first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989\u20131990). [1] Reception \nSince its debut on December 17th, 1989, the show has broadcast over 600 episodes; the twenty-eight season started airing on September 25th, 2016. The Simpsons is the longest-running American sitcom, the longest-running American animated program, and in 2009 it surpassed Gunsmoke as the longest-running American primetime, scripted television series. The Simpsons Movie , a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on July 26 and July 27th, 2007, and grossed over $527 million. \nThe Simpsons has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 27 Primetime Emmy Awards, 27 Annie Awards and a Peabody Award. Time Magazine\u2019s December 31st, 1999 issue named it the 20th century\u2019s best television series, and on January 14th, 2000 the Simpson family was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Homer\u2019s exclamatory catchphrase \u201cD\u2019oh!\u201d has been adopted into the English language, while The Simpsons has influenced many adult-oriented animated sitcoms. Online Presence \nThe Simpsons also has a robust online presence. The Simpsons Facebook page currently has more than 66.2 million likes. [13] Launched on August 13th, 2012, The Simpsons twitter account, @The Simpsons, currently has over 884,000 followers. On May 15th, 2016, the show fielded questions via Twitter to be incorporated into a live segment of the show, in which Homer answered questions in real time. [12] Simpsons World \nOn October 21st, 2014, Fox\u2019s cable network FX launched \u201cSimpsons World,\u201d allowing FX subscribers to stream every episode to stream every episode of the show via their FXNow App. Early in its release, fans criticized \u201cSimpsons World\u201d for not presenting the show in the proper aspect ratios and the time and length of commercial breaks, which altered the content of the show. FX eventually updated the app, giving users the option to view in their original aspect ratio. [1] Fandom \nSince the show is so ubiquitous, its fandom is not internet-based, although it is so large that it does has a significant online presence. The show has been around since the internet started becoming widely public in the early \u201990s, so its influence has been consistently felt throughout the history of the internet. \nThere are several Simpsons fan sites around the internet, but the majority of the online presence of the show is thanks to the frequent use of catchphrases, image macros, and YouTube clips. Frinkiac \nOn February 2nd, 2016, web developers Paul Kehrer, Sean Schultz, and Allie Young launched the Frinkiac, [14] a massive database of every shot and line from seasons 1 through 17 of the show. The site allows users to type in quotes and pinpoint the scene it comes from. They can then make memes or gifs based on the line. Newsweek said, \u201cIt may be the greatest feat of Internet engineering we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d [15] Impact \nThroughout its history, The Simpsons has been on the forefront of American pop culture, thanks to its witty writing and fearless parodying of current events and politics, as well as its consistent references to contemporary and historical pop culture and cult icons (such as Charles Bronson). The show has garnered controversy, brought to a head when in 1992 the then-US president George H. W. Bush remarked \u201c[we want] to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons.\u201d Arguably, this only increased interest in the show. The Simpsons has become an icon of American culture, and has had a lasting impact on society over its long run; many of its neologisms (such as D\u2019oh!, meh, yoink!, and crap-tacular) [1] and catchphrases are frequently used on- and off-line, and its characters are easily recognized all over the world. Related Memes \u201cMilhouse Is Not A Meme\u201d \nMilhouse is not a meme is a paradoxical statement and a well-known debate on the imageboard site 4chan about what constitutes an internet meme and what doesn\u2019t. The meme uses an image of the character Milhouse Van Houten, who in and of himself is not a meme \u2013 that is to say, Milhouse is not a meme, but \u201cMilhouse is not a meme\u201d is, in fact, a meme. Chalkboard Gag Parodies \nChalkboard Gag Parodies are a series of exploitable images based on the perennial chalkboard gag scene from The Simpsons \u2019 opening sequence. In the scene, Bart is seen repeatedly writing a message on a large chalkboard, as a form of punishment. In each episode, the text is changed, and is frequently a joke or pun. The exploitable is a natural extension of this, with users adding their own text. The Goggles Do Nothing! \nThe Goggles Do Nothing! is a catchphrase used for conveying the horror of having seen something unwanted, another way of saying \u201ccannot unsee.\u201d The quote was used in the Season 7 episode \u201cRadioactive Man,\u201d in which Rainier Wolfcastle, playing the action hero Radioactive Man, is doused with sulfuric acid while being protected only by a pair of goggles. As the acid eats through he clothes, he screams \u201cMy eyes! The goggles do nothing!\u201d Redundant Adjectives are Redundant! \n*(X) (Y) is is a common sentence structure derived from a scene in the Season 11 episode \u201cThe Grift of the Magi,\u201d in which Ralph excitedly says \u201cfun toys are fun!\u201d Use of the phrase online started with 4chan; it is often used to place a humorous emphasis on redundancy. Popular examples include \u201cLongcat is l ng\u201d, \u201cSuccessful troll is successful\u201d and \u201cOld pic is old.\u201d It has become a common phrase across the imageboards and the internet in general. I Must Go \nI Must Go, My People/Planet Need(s) Me is a caption frequently used on image macros showing people or animals jumping or flying away. The phrase originated in the Season 8 episode \u201cThe Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show,\u201d in which a character (Poochie), voiced by Homer, and introduced into the long-running cartoon \u201cItchy & Scratchy,\u201d is killed off. The caption first attained spread through demotivational posters \", and has since spread to other image macros. Stupid Sexy Flanders \nStupid Sexy Flanders is a phrase that comes from the Season 11 episode \u201cLittle Big Mom,\u201d spoken by Homer as he tries to think about what an skiing instructor said, but instead can\u2019t get the image of Flanders\u2019 skintight ski suit out of his mind. It has a similar usage on forums to \u201ccannot unsee,\u201d although it is generally used in situations where the viewer is secretly enthralled by the supposedly undesirable object, as opposed to being outright disgusted. It is also frequently used in YouTube parodies of the scene. I, For One, Welcome Our New X Overlords \nI, For One, Welcome Our New X Overlords - is a catchphrase from the Season 5 episode \u201cDeep Space Homer.\u201d It is spoken by news anchor Kent Brockman after he sees a video, transmitted from Homer\u2019s space mission, that shows ants flying around in the cabin of the spacecraft; the ants appear super-sized because they are close to the lens, which spooks Kent. The phrase is commonly used to comment facetiously on someone\u2019s or something\u2019s perceived control of a situation, and is one of the oldest and most well-established Simpsons -related memes. That\u2019s The Joke. \nThat\u2019s the Joke is a catchphrase originating from the Season 6 episode \u201cA Star is Burns.\u201d In it, Rainier Wolfcastle is being interviewed about his new stand-up comedy movie, and a clip is shown (see below). In the clip, Wolfcastle says \u201cDid you ever notice how men always leave the toilet seat up? [\u2026] That\u2019s the joke.\u201d The catchprase, often accompanied by an image of Wolfcastle looking serious in front of the brick wall (again, see above), is used to condescendingly explain the punchline of a joke, or is itself the punchline to an otherwise-unfunny remark. That\u2019s a Paddlin\u2019 \nThat\u2019s a Paddlin\u2019 (or X? That\u2019s a Paddlin\u2019) is a catchphrase/copypasta from the Season 6 episode \u201cThe PTA Disbands,\u201d in which local resident Jasper Beardly takes over teaching 2nd Grade at Springfield Elementary. He uses the phrase when outlining his classroom policies; for example, \u201cTalking out of turn? That\u2019s a paddlin\u2019.\u201d In the show, the phrase was intended to comment on the antiquated notion of corporal punishment in public schools, but online it has come to be used as a joke about authority and strange rules. The phrase is also used in various other snowclones, and the action of \u201cPaddlin\u2019\u201d has come to be associated with Jasper\u2019s image. Dental Plan / Lisa Needs Braces \nDental Plan / Lisa Needs Braces is a call-and-response template that peaked in popularity on 4chan in 2008. It originates from the Season 4 episode \u201cLast Exit to Springfield,\u201d in which Homer hears the words \u201cDental Plan\u201d (spoken by Lenny) and \u201cLisa Needs Braces\u201d (spoken by Marge) repeatedly in his head while his brain tries to connect the loss of his dental insurance with his having to pay out-of-pocket for Lisa\u2019s braces. Its online use is mostly related to the phrase\u2019s extremely repetitive and catchy nature; it is frequently used as an interruptor, either by repeating the phrase, or by repeating captioned images. The phrase has also been used in various YouTube remixes. Do It For Her \nDo It For Her is a photoshop meme originating from the Season 6 episode \u201cAnd Maggie Makes Three.\u201d The original image shows a placard in Homer\u2019s office reading \u201cDON\u2019T FORGET , YOU\u2019RE HERE FOREVER \u201d, over which Homer has plastered images of Maggie, so it reads \u201cDO IT FOR HER \u201d, referring to how he returned to his job in order to support her future. The meme usually involves photoshopping images of other characters in place of Maggie, such as Hatsune Miku . What a Time to be Alive \n\u201c*What a Time to be Alive*\u201d/memes/what-a-time-to-be-alive is a memorable quote from the animated television series The Simpsons which can be used to sarcastically express awe at a very minor technological advance, or alternatively, disapprove something that is without a precedence, similar to the use of the phrase \u201cI don\u2019t want to live on this planet anymore\u201d. Old Man Yells at Cloud \nOld Man Yells At Cloud is an exploitable image of a gag headline featured in a 2002 episode of The Simpsons . On the Internet, the newspaper clip of Abe Simpson angrily raising his fist under the literal headline \u201cOld Man Yells at Cloud\u201d has been repurposed into a series of reaction images for commentaries on various topics based on the phrasal template (X) Yells at (Y). Now Do Classical Gas \nNow Do Classical Gas is a quote from The Simpsons character Lenny in the episode \u201cLast Exit to Springfield.\u201d In the scene, Lenny asks Lisa, who is playing acoustic guitar, to play the piece \u201cClassical Gas\u201d by Mason Williams. [1] The scene became the subject of YouTube Poop remix videos popular on the Facebook page Simpsons Shitposting in early 2017. The Simpsons Did It \nThe Simpsons Did It is catchphrase used to call out an idea widely perceived as original or new that may have been already portrayed in an episode of the long-running American animated TV sitcom The Simpsons . Online, it is typically uttered by fans of the TV show to point out odd similarities between an emerging trend, or a current event in the news, and a plot point from a previously aired episode of The Simpsons , whether by coincidence or intention. Bart\u2019s Testing Megaphones \nBart\u2019s Testing Megaphones refers to a series of video remixes of a clip from_ The Simpsons_ in which Bart Simpson uses a series of megaphones to prank the town of Springfield. Bootleg Bart \nBootleg Bart refers to original unauthorized merchandise and/or original or contemporary fan art created with the image of Bart Simpson, often mutated or badly drawn, or sometimes with the character represented as a different ethnicity. While originally created to capitalize on fandom for the original character, the bootleg version now has a clear fan base of its own. Marge Krumping \nMarge Krumping , also known as \u201cMarge Dance,\u201d is a photoshop meme based on an exploitable still shot of The Simpsons character Marge Simpson trying to krump, a style of hip hop dance characterized by highly energetic and expressive movement of one\u2019s head and the limbs. Home Backs Into Things \nHomer Backs Into Things is a reaction GIF taken from a scene in the animated comedy series The Simpsons in which the main character, Homer Simpson, steps back into a hedge until he is no longer visible.

Repeat. Verified Creator. \nAMC released the first poster for the upcoming third season of #FeartheWalkingDead . The new season will premiere in a few months - on June 4, to be exact - but the stakes are high with the new poster. 'Fear The Walking Dead' Season 3: News, Trailers, Release Date & All You Need To Know \nIn the art, Nick (Frank Dillane) is in profile, with La Muerte drawn on his face in blood. The poster's wording is also strong: \"Fear what you become\" is a clear nod to Nick's change of heart in the course of the two previous seasons of Fear the Walking Dead . New art for 'Fear The Walking Dead' Season 3 \nIndeed, if I were anyone in that new survivors' camp, I'd really fear what Nick has and could become. Spending some time among them, Nick has an unique view of how things work in this apocalyptic scenario. Last season, Nick found yet another community who saw the undead not as killable creatures, but as people who were simply awaiting their time to be reborn. Of course, things didn't go according to plan and, once more, Nick was disappointed by those he trusted the most. Nick has been through hell in back in 'Fear The Walking Dead' [Credit: AMC] \nMost notably last season, nstead of simply leaving Alejandro, Luciana, and the others behind, Nick convinced them to try and reach what seemed like a survivors' camp, only to be ambushed and shot at by said survivors. It's fair to say Nick's journey has seen its share of betrayal and awful surprises - none of which Nick seems ever ready to face. But he's found his place amongst the chaos and, most importantly, Nick understands what he needs to do to keep himself and those he loves alive. \nSee Also: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "organizations": [], "locations": []}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-20T07:28:11.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "1ddc9d53183a828241e37a3b98f6c8a8d759f7ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2IR95VYfCVjlhvXM07ZvpSrtHUChAesykGpBWppv4r_HlPIzSGu8Nkzh61pP2bNScpRgMT434BBGlKNKlPI3iB7DbEqgVfjM5TsrWKkS8z.w4.O595Imwqgf9LGSIynE-", "site_full": "www.dailydot.com", "site": "dailydot.com", "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "", "title": "Sean Spicer Struggles to Name Legislative Wins in Trump's First 100 Days", "title_full": "Sean Spicer Struggles to Name Legislative Wins in Trump's First 100 Days", "published": "2017-04-20T01:16:00.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.132, "main_image": "https://19818-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/63c/3f/fc02ef1a56fff51d.png", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 4802, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 575, "comments": 0, "shares": 575}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "1ddc9d53183a828241e37a3b98f6c8a8d759f7ec", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQ2IR95VYfCVjlhvXM07ZvpSrtHUChAesykGpBWppv4r_HlPIzSGu8Nkzh61pP2bNScpRgMT434BBGlKNKlPI3iB7DbEqgVfjM5TsrWKkS8z.w4.O595Imwqgf9LGSIynE-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Phillip Tracy", "published": "2017-04-20T01:16:00.000+03:00", "title": "Sean Spicer Struggles to Name Legislative Wins in Trump's First 100 Days", "text": "Screenshot via White House/YouTube BTW \nA journalist at the White House press briefing on Wednesday asked Press Secretary Sean Spicer what should have been the ultimate softball question: \u201cSetting aside executive orders, can you say what the single piece of legislation that you are proudest you got through the Congress that was on the president\u2019s agenda?\u201d \nThis would have been the perfect time for talking points, but instead, Spicer bought himself some time with, \u201cWell, a few things on that.

Now he\u2019s reliving that horrific day all over again for a new documentary. \nPrince William , 34, is opening up about one of the most devastating moments of his entire life \u2014 the sudden death of his mother Princess Diana in 1997. \u201cThe shock is the biggest thing,\u201d the father of two says in a new BBC documentary Mind Over Marathon , which will air in the U.K. on April 20. \u201cI still feel, 20 years later about my mother, I still have shock within me . . . People say shock can\u2019t last that long, but it does. You never get over it. It\u2019s such an unbelievably big moment in your life that it never leaves you, you just learn to deal with it.\u201d \nIn the film \u2014 which follows the story of 10 different London Marathon runners who struggle with mental health issues \u2014 William discusses the horrible tragedy that rocked not just the Royal Family, but the entire world. Handsome Times 3 \u2014 Princes Harry, William & Justin Trudeau \n\u201cYou try and understand your emotions a lot more than probably someone who\u2019s just lived life without issues, and that\u2019s quite critical,\u201d William told host Nick Knowles . \u201cIt\u2019s explaining to them what those emotions mean, why they feel like they do. Once you start rationalizing a little bit and you understand, \u2018Okay, so I\u2019m a little angry or a little down or a little upset about something,\u2019 then you can kind of relativize it and sort of deal with it.\u201d \nWilliam explained that because of the loss he\u2019s suffered he is very passionate about mental health and advocates for those who need help through his Heads Together campaign, which he promotes with wife Princess Kate , 35, and brother Prince Harry , 32. \n\u201cI have my own reasons for being involved in mental health: What happened to me and my mother when I was younger.

Spink , the Hollywood film producer one half of the management and production company Benderspink , who was a machine when it came to script sales, has died, it was confirmed by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner. No cause of death was released as yet. He was 45. \n\u201cHe was found unresponsive at the scene at the residence on 1200 Green Acre last night at 8:18 PM by his brother,\u201d said the Coroner Ed Winter. \u201cIt was reported to us as possible natural causes, and we are looking into it.\u201d \nSpink and Chris Bender were college roommates who started the management company and built it into a reputable firm before Spink left last May in an acrimonious departure. Spink\u2019s producer credits included The Hangover and The Ring franchises, We\u2019re The Millers, I Am Number Four, Monster-In-Law, The Butterfly Effect, Cats and Dogs and last year\u2019s Criminal starring Kevin Costner and Ryan Reynolds. \nSpink also was an actor, well sort of. He had cameos in two episodes of Adam Goldberg\u2019s hit TV show The Goldbergs . Spink was also a former schoolmate of Goldberg who had actually written a character into the show for him. \u201cEver since we were kids on the school bus, J.C. was a passionate, driven and brilliant guy who put his friends first,\u201d Goldberg said in a statement. \u201cHe mastered the spec game by his 30s, but even more impressive, he gave countless writers a start in the business. One of my best memories on The Goldbergs was when I cast J.C. to play our angry bus driver from our childhood. It was so surreal and incredibly fun. He really will be missed.\u201d \nSpink and Bender dissolved the company after an 18-year run that saw a slew of hits for its swath of A-list writers. We spoke to Spink many times here at Deadline and he was always promoting his clients with passionate enthusiasm. He was extremely well liked around town and affable. He also liked to live on the edge and in the past had some problems with addiction. \n\u201cWe started Benderspink in our late 20s almost 18 years ago,\u201d the pair said in a joint statement at the time of the breakup. \u201cWe could not be more proud of what we\u2019ve worked on together and are excited for the next chapter in each of our lives.\u201d", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "j.c. spink", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "benderspink", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chris bender", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bender", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ryan reynolds", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ed winter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin costner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "adam goldberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "goldbergs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spink", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "green acre", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "los angeles county", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "j.c.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-20T06:25:17.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "f2b480c9acdfe15ec55ede96d6a402ca9d1eece7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.xHofw8QuW5NE5DKo9Yw.CeQ9BLha4BIDE4Hct.ml9no6bdVYT9WLDyyrHxMqnKopKAwvLMLaip4smCtUsEjOCWjd8ttysf939oTwWkR6oc3FKJFF_qN5RPHRzY_mYjSSx2jA7D6t_IdNId2VPyErO7f0jLFZSpKykSR3WjCuI8F30HbScEeqcwDL9Hpwl9VU-", "site_full": "www.slate.com", "site": "slate.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.slate.com/slate", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Slate Articles", "title": "Still a Factor", "title_full": "Still a Factor", "published": "2017-04-20T01:19:02.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2017/04/170419_POL_OReilly-Life.jpg.CROP.promo-large.jpg", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 628, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 567, "comments": 0, "shares": 567}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "f2b480c9acdfe15ec55ede96d6a402ca9d1eece7", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.xHofw8QuW5NE5DKo9Yw.CeQ9BLha4BIDE4Hct.ml9no6bdVYT9WLDyyrHxMqnKopKAwvLMLaip4smCtUsEjOCWjd8ttysf939oTwWkR6oc3FKJFF_qN5RPHRzY_mYjSSx2jA7D6t_IdNId2VPyErO7f0jLFZSpKykSR3WjCuI8F30HbScEeqcwDL9Hpwl9VU-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Isaac Chotiner", "published": "2017-04-20T01:19:02.000+03:00", "title": "Still a Factor", "text": "There was no more apt pupil of O\u2019Reilly\u2019s school of egotism and resentment than the current president of the United States. Photo illustration by Slate . Photo by Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images. \nBill O\u2019Reilly and the Fox News Channel have negotiated an exit deal for the highest rated host in cable news. Thanks in part to vigorous reporting on numerous sexual-harassment allegations against him, a number of advertisers pulled spots from The O\u2019Reilly Factor ,which has now aired its final episode. As the most-watched host on the most successful cable channel of the past two decades, O\u2019Reilly came to represent a style of in-your face conservatism that had previously been associated primarily with talk radio. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s uniquely aggressive personality and instinctual skills in front of the camera go a long way toward explaining his success. But he also tapped into the right-wing id in a way no one had before, captivating his viewers with his unbridled egotism and stoking their resentments. It was a playbook that won him a huge audience\u2014and, to judge by Donald Trump\u2019s eerily similar appeal to voters, a legacy that will outlast his grip on the 8 p.m. time slot. Isaac Chotiner \nIsaac Chotiner is a Slate staff writer. \nWhen The O\u2019Reilly Report began in 1996\u2014the show didn\u2019t become what O\u2019Reilly referred to as \u201cThe Factor\u201d until 1998\u2014it was your typical anti-Clinton offering from Fox News, with many of the same preoccupations of other conservative programs in the second half of that decade. (White House scandals, mainly.) Over his first several years on the air, O\u2019Reilly made an effort to appear reasonable. He declared that he was not a Republican, but an independent; he refused to support the death penalty; he talked about the value of environmental protection; he said that he understood both sides of the debate on issues such as gun control and the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict; and he took immense pride\u2014which manifested itself as smug self-satisfaction\u2014in his supposedly nonpartisan, down-home common sense. This posture may have been dishonest\u2014O\u2019Reilly was a registered Republican who was happy to demagogue issues like gay rights when it suited him. But the gap between O\u2019Reilly and robotic partisans such as Sean Hannity was noticeable, and the posture fit with the \u201cfair and balanced\u201d ethos that Fox News was then making an effort to pretend to uphold. Advertisement \nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s minor heresies during his first decade on the air were ultimately less indicative of the future direction of his show than the passions that always consumed him. These were not the same passions of the Club for Growth crowd. O\u2019Reilly was naturally in favor of tax cuts and smaller government, and after 9/11 he became predictably jingoistic, offering full-throated support for the Iraq war and a tough line on terrorism. But even then it was clear that the traditional Republican platform never really motivated him. The idea of O\u2019Reilly spending more than 30 seconds talking about supply-side economics was unfathomable; Limbaugh and Hannity would do so constantly. Instead, what motivated O\u2019Reilly were two kinds of resentment. If we\u2019d paid closer attention to O\u2019Reilly\u2019s success, Trump\u2019s rise would perhaps have been a bit less of a shock. \nThe first was typical of the cultural conservatism of our age, and generally consisted of free-floating anger at any figure or institution that didn\u2019t uphold what O\u2019Reilly called \u201ctraditional values.\u201d A college professor would call America a fascist country, or a retailer would announce that it would greet customers with \u201chappy holidays\u201d rather than \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d O\u2019Reilly would rant and rave; he would call for people to be fired; he would bemoan that America was becoming less religious and less white. (One of his many silly books was called Culture Warrior ; the latest is Old School .) Sure, Limbaugh and Hannity would occasionally focus on culture instead of politics, but for O\u2019Reilly, it was what fueled the show, and what really got him exercised. (Much was made of his Levittown upbringing and disdain for snobby elites.) Even better, he didn\u2019t appear to be faking it in the way one often suspects of certain right-wing hosts. All of the details that have leaked out about O\u2019Reilly\u2014from the harassment claims to the violent way he behaved toward his ex-wife\u2014strongly suggest that he was not playing a character when he fumed on the air. Get Slate in your inbox. \nBut the aspect of The O\u2019Reilly Factor that always shocked me was a different kind of resentment, which took the form of the anchor\u2019s unrepentant solipsism. It\u2019s simply impossible to overstate how much of each night\u2019s show was consumed by O\u2019Reilly\u2019s own grievances. He skirmished with everyone from Matt Lauer to Rosie O\u2019Donnell to Al Franken, and those fights would invariably become the topic of the day on his show. He spent countless hours talking about himself \u2014usually as the victim of various conspiracies. (Frequently, George Soros was the conspiracy\u2019s prime mover.) He would drone on about the New York Times and how it was out to make him look bad. It was endless, and it was exceptionally boring\u2014to everyone except his legions of viewers and fans. \nI never really had a theory for how this supposed man of the people got away with talking about nothing but himself. Then Donald Trump came along. Here was another rich guy who built a following speaking up for the working man. Like O\u2019Reilly he seemed entirely driven by resentment: at President Obama, at the media, at the people who doubted him. And like O\u2019Reilly, he spoke almost entirely of himself. His stump speeches were shocking, in part, because they were rarely about anything other than Donald Trump. When I would see him talk to a bunch of working-class voters in the Midwest and appeal to them by describing his own battles with CNN, I was surprised. But not as surprised as I would have been if I hadn\u2019t been watching O\u2019Reilly all these years. Advertisement \nI have no idea if Trump\u2014a compulsive Fox News watcher\u2014consciously modeled aspects of his personality (or at least the ones that are conscious constructions) on O\u2019Reilly. (They were friendly with each other well before Trump began his run for the presidency.) But if we had been paying closer attention to just how O\u2019Reilly managed to succeed, Trump\u2019s rise would perhaps have been a bit less of a shock. Neither man\u2019s appeal was primarily about something like \u201ceconomic insecurity\u201d; it was about group identity, and the cultural resentments that each man expertly cultivated. When your viewers (or voters) feel the same resentments, and come to view you as one of them, anything and everything becomes forgivable, and your trials and tribulations, however foreign, somehow become relatable. \nWhatever Trump took from O\u2019Reilly, it seems clear that the Donald\u2019s unlikely political rise emboldened the Factor . In recent months, O\u2019Reilly has become a conspicuously more Trumpist figure. The racism and misogyny have been dialed up; the hard edge on issues like immigration, on which he had once tried to equivocate, have been emphasized; and his partisanship is now so obvious as to be a punchline. Top Comment \nIt's the modern American conservatism: publicly claiming to define and enforce traditional values and morality, while stuffing your pockets with money and treating women like sex toys. These guys are just crooked televangelists, using politics instead of religion. More... Join In \nIn 2016 and 2017, as both O\u2019Reilly and Trump battled accusations of misconduct, it\u2019s been hard not to see them as twinned: bigoted, sexist dinosaurs from the past. Each man went to extreme lengths to defend the other, and you sensed that this wasn\u2019t only because they share the same audience but also because they have so much in common, that they really do see themselves in one another. \nWhich is why it was initially so exhilarating to hear that the O\u2019Reilly era has ended, at least on Fox: Finally we are seeing the downfall of a true symbol of reaction and misogyny. But satisfaction these days has a tendency to give way to despair. An even larger symbol (and transmitter) of these ugly ideas is sitting in the White House. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s time has finally come, but the forces he helped unleash on American culture remain ascendant.

The flu can be an amazing diet. So happy it came in time for the Met lol #6lbsdown \n\u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) April 19, 2017 \nKim has had some iconic Met Ball looks, dating back to 2013, the first year she and Kanye went together. She was nearly nine months pregnant with their daughter, North West , that year, and accentuated her baby bump in a skintight, floral gown and gloves that still has people talking (and cringing). Luckily, even Kim herself is able to poke fun at this look years later \u2014 she wore the ensemble again on Halloween 2015 when she was pregnant with Saint . Kim Kardashian\u2019s Biggest Dramas \u2014 PICS \nShe made a major comeback the next year, though, in a strapless, navy dress with back belt and lining. The ensemble also featured a thigh-high slit that allowed the reality star to show a lot of leg, and it was super sexy. In 2015, she stunned in a sheer, backless, embellished ensemble, and she looked absolutely amazing. \nLast year, Kim shined in a metallic silver gown with a slit , which was perfect for the Age of Technology theme of 2016. She was only five months post-baby here, and has since lost even more weight, so after shedding these last six pounds, her body is totally going to be on point this year. We can\u2019t wait to see what she wears! \nHollywoodLifers , what do you think Kim will wear to the Met Gala this year?

Bros Before Hoes 'The Walking Dead' [Credit: AMC] \nSpeaking at Walker Stalker Con, both the man behind the mullet and the man with the 'tash opened up about Eugene's betrayal and what could happen next. McDermitt was the first to speak, blaming Abraham's departure on his newfound allegiances: \n\"I think Abraham would not be surprised by it but honestly, if Abraham was still there, Eugene would still be with Abraham. That's the dynamic and the relationship that the two of them had, that Abraham protected Eugene, and now Eugene is seeking protection elsewhere.\" \nCudlitz himself was quick to chime in with \"let's ask Abraham\": \n\"I think he's being very, very true to character. This is exactly the guy I punched in the face at the fire truck. He's staying alive. Especially if somebody he's looking for me in protection, and he sees the person that he felt could protect him from anything gets killed ,what the hell kind of chance does he think he stands in his own head? He's gonna say no? He's gonna defy them? He's gonna somehow beat Negan? He may ultimately poison their entire food supply and kill them all but not today!

When we met the duo back in Season 4, Abraham's sole mission was to get Eugene to Washington under claims that he knew what started the outbreak and could engineer a cure. In classic TWD style, it never was that easy, and the big reveal that Eugene had lied about his job pushed Abraham to breaking point as he K.O.'ed Eugene with a solid punch. Although they rekindled their friendship somewhat as the show continued, things would never be the same. \nSee also: ", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "michael cudlitz", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "eugene", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "abraham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abraham ford", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eugene porter", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mcdermitt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "abe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "negan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tom chapman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cudlitz", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "walker stalker con", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ford", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-20T07:27:56.000+03:00"}, {"thread": {"uuid": "9d121676140a831f03e55610d961f6380cfed8a4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.xHofw8QuW5NE5DKo9Yw.CeQ9BLha4BIDE4Hct.ml9no6bdVYT9WLDyyrHxMqnKopKAwvLMLaip0p4z__67SXXuoMvnm9fzHAGFTqkO9w.cXms19.oNSRm0rxlEcp6OePjNEibiYaxSW6t9DuAJ2YT9bgM_6onUcQCKSesd0k_U8PsOAPmPmTuueUi69sdQCs-", "site_full": "www.slate.com", "site": "slate.com", "site_section": "http://feeds.slate.com/slate", "site_categories": [], "section_title": "Slate Articles", "title": "Georgia\u2019s 6th Is a Democratic Win", "title_full": "Georgia\u2019s 6th Is a Democratic Win", "published": "2017-04-20T01:56:32.000+03:00", "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2017/04/170419_POL_Jon-Ossoff-Wave.jpg.CROP.promo-large.jpg", "performance_score": 5, "domain_rank": 628, "social": {"facebook": {"likes": 554, "comments": 0, "shares": 554}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}}, "uuid": "9d121676140a831f03e55610d961f6380cfed8a4", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.xHofw8QuW5NE5DKo9Yw.CeQ9BLha4BIDE4Hct.ml9no6bdVYT9WLDyyrHxMqnKopKAwvLMLaip0p4z__67SXXuoMvnm9fzHAGFTqkO9w.cXms19.oNSRm0rxlEcp6OePjNEibiYaxSW6t9DuAJ2YT9bgM_6onUcQCKSesd0k_U8PsOAPmPmTuueUi69sdQCs-", "ord_in_thread": 0, "author": "Jamelle Bouie", "published": "2017-04-20T01:56:32.000+03:00", "title": "Georgia\u2019s 6th Is a Democratic Win", "text": "Who's winning, who's losing, and why.

Jamelle Bouie \nJamelle Bouie is Slate \u2019 s chief political correspondent. \nAt first glance, the race doesn\u2019t look especially competitive; Thompson won just 45.7 percent of the vote, to 52.5 percent for his opponent Ron Estes. But you have to consider the context: Pompeo won that same seat , five months earlier, with 60 percent support. His Democratic opponent won just 29.6 percent of the vote. Thompson, in other words, shrank a 31-point margin to just 7 points, a remarkable swing in a district that is 15 points more Republican than the nation at large, making it the 74 th most conservative district in the country . It\u2019s true that Democrats didn\u2019t win the seat\u2014fueling a round of possibly overwrought recriminations as activists and observers slammed the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for holding back support\u2014but it was still a victory, or at least a sign of good fortune for Democratic efforts to win the House of Representatives in 2018 or 2020. There are 59 Republican-held seats in districts that are less conservative than the one in Georgia. Advertisement \nThis past Tuesday saw a second special election, in Georgia\u2019s 6 th Congressional District, with Democrat Jon Ossofff facing off against a phalanx of Republican candidates in a so-called \u201cjungle primary,\u201d all vying to either win more than 50 percent outright, or go to a runoff election in June. Another solid red district , the Georgia 6 th gave Republican Tom Price\u2014now Trump\u2019s secretary of health and human services\u2014nearly 62 percent of the vote in November. On the presidential level, Mitt Romney won by a similar margin against Barack Obama in 2012. But Donald Trump barely squeaked out a win there, making the district a prime target for Democrats. Ossoff collected millions in donations and amassed an army of grassroots volunteers. But while he won the lion\u2019s share of votes , 48 percent to just under 20 percent for his nearest competitor, Republican Karen Handel, he didn\u2019t escape the runoff. He\u2019ll vie again for the seat in June against Handel, in a race where neither candidate has a clear advantage. \nOne way to read this is that Democrats have failed. (That is what Press Secretary Sean Spicer said explicitly on Wednesday.) That for all the base anger, there\u2019s not enough energy or organization to capture Republican districts and deal an actual electoral blow to Donald Trump. But this is shortsighted. Ossoff\u2019s performance represents a major swing from November. And this, in a previously safe Republican district, with just four months to mobilize and build a campaign. It might not be success, but it\u2019s indicative of shifting political ground.

And the one after that is for a district, South Carolina\u2019s 5 th , that is 9 points more Republican than average . In either race, a swing of the sort we\u2019ve seen in Georgia and Kansas would be significant, even if Democrats lose. Movement with that consistency would suggest a worsening national atmosphere for Republicans, one in which Democrats could potentially take the 24 seats they need to win the House next year. According to the Cook Report , there are 59 Republican-held seats in districts that are less conservative than the one in Georgia. Both Kansas and Georgia, in other words, are good national omens for Democrats. \nThey also have an immediate, present effect. Now is the time when lawmakers are making choices about their careers\u2014where they decide if re-election is in their futures, or if they will retire. The kind of atmosphere where Democrats are competitive in solid and deep-red districts is one where vulnerable or wary Republicans think twice about filing for another election. It\u2019s not hard to imagine a scenario where, following tight contests in Montana and South Carolina, Republican lawmakers start announcing retirements. Already, Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz\u2014following vocal criticism from constituents and constant ridicule for his conduct as House Oversight chair\u2014 announced on Wednesday his plan to \u201creturn to the private sector\u201d at the end of his term. Would-be incumbents clearing out strong Republican seats also would have the potential to make races in those districts more competitive going forward. If nothing else, beyond retirement, Republican lawmakers will think twice about backing the Trump administration if doing so yields a real challenge for their seat.

Join In \nOn the other side, recruits are always easy to find when the field is in your favor, and Democrats may find themselves, for the first time in years, with strong candidates to run in as many districts as possible. \nYes, there are larger factors at work. If, between now and next year, Donald Trump becomes popular, the situation changes. Likewise, if the economy experiences an unprecedented boom, the situation changes. But if we assume more of the same\u2014an energized Democratic base and a flailing administration, mired in controversy\u2014then Democrats enter the 2018 election season on favorable terrain. The question, then, is if Democrats can utilize that advantage, not just to flip the House, but to rebuild the party itself, and make it a regular presence in those places where it\u2019s been absent. The time for a long-term strategy is now, and it remains to be seen if Democrats are up for the challenge.

Fanning and Dunst star in The Beguiled as a student and a teacher, respectively, living at the Miss Martha Farnsworth Seminary for Young Ladies during the Civil War.

Originally posted on April 20, 2017, 19:43 GMT Updated on \nFrench President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande addressed the nation Thursday night, saying the French security forces would be working to investigate the motive and any accomplices who may have played a role. \n\"We believe the attack is of a terrorist nature,\" Hollande said. \nFrench officials have not made any public statement linking the terror group to the shooting. But Site Intel Group, which monitors insurgent networks, said ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack through its news agency, Amaq. \nISIS has claimed responsibility for attacks where the suspects were found to have no direct link to the group. On Thursday, however, the claim of responsibility from the terrorist group came much more quickly than in the past. \nThe pseudonym listed for the alleged attacker, Abu Yusuf al-Beljiki \u2014 meaning \"the Belgian\" in Arabic \u2014 suggested he had some sort of tie to the group, the Associated Press reported . \nFew details were released overnight about the suspected gunman, other than that he was 39 years old and lived east of Paris, according to the AP. \nBelgium's Interior Minister Jan Jambon told public broadcaster VRT on Friday morning that the perpetrator is believed to be a French national. \nA Belgian police official told BuzzFeed News late on Thursday that a possible suspect or accomplice had turned himself into police and is being investigated for any links to the attack in Paris. \nIn his address, Hollande also expressed his condolences for the slain officer and two other officers who were injured in the confrontation. \nA bystander was also wounded in the shootout. \n\"Our security is at stake,\" Hollande said. \"This is the message I would like to send tonight. This is a message not only to police forces, the army, it's a message to everyone: you will be protected.\" \nFrance's Interior Minister Matthias Fekl touted the work of police at the scene, and said their quick action avoided more injuries. \n\"We've avoided a bigger tragedy on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es,\" Fekl told reporters. \"Tonight we avoided a bloodbath that could have been extremely dire.\"", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "facebo", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "christian hartmann", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ralph", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melissa bell", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "us state department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "buzzfeed news buzzfeed news", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "le monde", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "champs elys\u00e9es", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "crawled": "2017-04-20T22:54:25.000+03:00"}], "totalResults": 111, "moreResultsAvailable": 11, "next": "/search?token=86b3b0d7-10fa-4025-b410-6898f9019d7d&format=json&ts=1492640154663&q=language%3A%28english%29+thread.country%3AUS+performance_score%3A%3E4+%28site_type%3Anews%29+site_category%3Aentertainment&sort=social.facebook.likes&from=100&sort=desc", "requestsLeft": 715}
