But after the March for Science movement began in the US, some are organising protests to stand up for their colleagues across the pond \u2013 and for themselves. Posted on Share On link \nWhen Story Sylwester set up a Facebook group five days after President Trump\u2019s inauguration, she didn\u2019t intend to organise a march on parliament, she just knew she had to do something . \nBut this Saturday, April 22, thanks to the efforts of Sylwester and dozens of other volunteers around the UK, thousands of people are expected to march in London, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Manchester, and Bristol in support of science. They join thousands more scientists at over 400 satellite marches around the world, as well as at the main event in Washington, DC. \nSylwester is originally from the US and moved to the UK to do an MSc in paleopathology \u2013 looking at bones for evidence of disease \u2013 at Durham University. Seeing events in the US unfold from across the pond \u2013 a short-lived order preventing US Department of Agriculture employees communicating science to the public, for example, or Trump appointing a new head of the US Environmental Protection Agency who\u2019s expressed doubts that humans are causing global warming \u2013 Sylwester says she needed to feel like she was taking action. \n\u201cI was very excited that a movement for science was happening. It occurred to me that if I wanted to go to a march, then it might be good to just start a group myself,\u201d she tells BuzzFeed News. \u201cI wasn\u2019t intending, originally, to take a role in the planning of our London march. \n\u201cI\u2019ve never done anything like this before.\u201d Share \nStory Sylwester, an organiser for the London science march, at Durham University where she studies paleopathology. \nSince then the movement, in the US at least, has been mired in debate about how organisers have dealt with diversity , or whether it\u2019s too political , and even about whether scientists should be marching at all. Geologist Robert Young argued in an op-ed in the New York Times that \u201ca march by scientists, while well intentioned, will serve only to trivialize and politicize the science we care so much about, turn scientists into another group caught up in the culture wars.\u201d \nMeanwhile, in the UK, many scientists like Sylwester are picking up placards and getting involved in organising for the first time. \n\u201cScientists are not famous for their camaraderie,\u201d David Reay, professor of carbon management at the University of Edinburgh told the Science Media Centre. \u201cWe are trained to question, criticise and, where needed, contest each other\u2019s work. We compete for funding, vie for tenure and race to be first to a new discovery. That we are now marching together is testament to just how threatened our disparate community feels.\u201d \nAs well as standing in solidarity with fellow scientists in the US and celebrating the positives of science at a time when experts are feeling increasingly ignored, they are highlighting local issues \u2013 including how Brexit is affecting their labs and how important science is for the UK economy. Share \nCardiff organisers Edward Jones, Jenny Wymant, and Sarah Jaffa outside the Cardiff Welsh Assembly. \nRoberto Cahuantzi, a PhD student at the University of Sheffield, originally from Mexico, is one of them. When he heard about the March for Science movement, he knew he wanted to go to one. But when it looked like nobody else was going to set anything up near him, he did it himself, creating the Facebook group that became the March for Science in Manchester . \n\u201cI have been feeling this trend in society about how a lot of politicians are blatantly disregarding the advice of experts. I have felt very impotent in front of these things, like Brexit, the Trump presidency, the problems that Mexican politics has,\u201d he says. \u201cI am trying to feel that I am doing something for a greater good.\u201d \nCahuantzi says climate change is the biggest issue the world is facing right now, and he thinks politicians are ignoring the advice of scientists on it. \u201cI think it\u2019s very, very important for us to speak up, to let them know that we want solutions, real solutions, not procrastination and scapegoating,\u201d he says. \nAll three members of the team behind the Cardiff march are new to protest organising, too. \u201cI think a lot of scientists aren't normally involved in this kind of activity; it's like there's been a big jump in awareness of the issues around this,\u201d Sarah Jaffa, a PhD student in astrophysics at Cardiff University, told BuzzFeed News. \nJenny Wymant, a cancer researcher, also at Cardiff, says they\u2019ve been getting help from people around the country as they begin to navigate this new sphere. \n\u201cIt's really nice because that's how science works too,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you don't know how to do a thing, you go and find an engineer that does, or you go and find a chemist who can help you make a thing, and the march is like a little reflection of that.\u201d ", "crawled": "2017-04-20T13:55:27.000+03:00",

Nerd out with me on Twitter, comrades: @alishagrauso \nOf all the Marvel films in development, perhaps none has had more riding on it or been more elusive with details than #CaptainMarvel . \nAfter the casting of Brie Larson as the titular character, not much has been forthcoming about the flick, but finally, Marvel has announced that it's tapped its directors\u2014yes, \"directors,\" as in two. \nVariety is reporting that Mississippi Grind directing duo Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck will be the ones to pilot Carol Danvers into her first adventures in the MCU. Credit: BossLogic \nIt appears the pair have brought something special to the table to land the gig\u2014 #Marvel made it clear after Larson's casting that it was just fine taking its time searching for the right director, particularly as it was adamant it wanted the script to be solid before taking the next step. The studio also specified that it was especially keen to have a female director at the helm, considering this will be Marvel's first female-led superhero film. \nFor those of you fans scratching your heads and going, \"Who the hell are those guys?,\" don't forget\u2014you'd likely never heard of James Gunn or the Russo brothers before they made some of your favorite Marvel films to date. We can expect it will be no less the case here. The studio reportedly met with Boden and Fleck a handful of times before officially offering the job, an indicator that they're really happy with the vision that the pair had for the character of Captain Marvel and how to integrate her into the #MCU . \nAnd it's very cool that, in front and behind the camera, this is going to be a female-powered flick. Carol Danvers is the very definition of a kickass female inside and out. With #BrieLarson taking on the role, Boden directing, and screenwriting team Meg LeFauve and Nicole Perlman behind the script, we can expect this movie to do justice to Captain Marvel\u2014just as she deserves. \nCaptain Marvel hits theaters on March 8, 2019.

[Credit: Marvel] By Eleanor Tremeer , writer at Creators.co MP staff. I talk about Star Wars a lot. Sometimes I'm paid for it. \nMarvel may have got the head start (by almost a decade), but DC is catching up to the franchise titan with several movies under the #DCEU 's belt and a ton more announced to be developed in the next few years. One such movie is Batgirl , a proposed film focusing on the young budding sleuth who follows in Batman's footsteps \u2014 and in news that delighted and distressed people in almost equal measure, Joss Whedon was tapped to direct. But before all the debates lit up the internet in a storm of flame wars, most people were just surprised Warner Bros. went to Joss Whedon considering his history with Marvel Studios. \nJoss Whedon is nothing if not a prolific director \u2014 after Buffy The Vampire Slayer became a pop culture sensation, the director went on to showrun several popular TV shows before launching the #MCU into team-up movie tradition with 2012's The Avengers . Whedon & Marvel: A Love/Hate Story \nThe Avengers was hugely successful, earning over a billion dollars at the box office and beginning what was possibly the MCU's golden age of solo movies. His second outing with Age of Ultron , however, was less successful critically (though it still earned over a billion), with many people critiquing the convoluted plot, weak villain, and tired quippy dialogue \u2014 and the less said of poor Black Widow's awkward romantic subplot the better. \nWhedon blamed much of the problems on #Marvel , citing creative differences and complaining that he wasn't allowed the freedom he had on The Avengers. As has now become something of a tradition between Marvel Studios and their directors (several others left projects for similar reasons), it looked like the relationship between Whedon and Marvel was left rather uneasy. \nWant More Batgirl?

Bad jokes aplenty.

After all, it's now possible to enjoy pretty much all of the major reveals from Celebration from the comfort of our own homes, phones and/or offices. Now, sure, we can't (necessarily) hang out with legendary actors from the #StarWars franchise that way, but otherwise we're pretty much covered. \nA perfect case in point? You Can Now Enjoy A NSFW Blooper From 'Star Wars: A New Hope' In This Here Article \nYup, that's right. Thanks to the folks over at The Cinema Realm, you can now watch a blooper from #ANewHope , just above. In it, Angus MacInnes, a.k.a. \"Gold Leader,\" offers up some key communiques to his fellow Rebel pilots \u2014 and drops an F-Bomb or two in the process. \nAll of which is, of course, absolutely hilarious. What's more, with the scene having originally arrived on Day 1 of Celebration (during a panel featuring Industrial Light and Magic Chief Creative Officer John Knoll), it's precisely the sort of behind-the-scenes glimpse to temper any latent feelings of galactic FOMO. Not least, in fact, because it's accompanied by a previously unseen deleted scene featuring none other than the iconic #CarrieFisher herself: \nIn it, we see a longer version of #Leia 's conversation with Peter Cushing's #GrandMoffTarkin in A New Hope , a scene that seems all the more pertinent in the wake of the pair's recent digital revival in #RogueOne . \nAll in all, then?

Captain Marvel found its directing duo , the first press screenings for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 hit , the New Warriors series characters revealed , and now, the first trailer for its upcoming #CloakandDagger TV series has officially been released. First Trailer For 'Cloak And Dagger' Has Hit The Web \nThis trailer is more like an extended sneak peak, but it did manage to give us a general idea of what the new series will be about. For those unfamiliar with the story in the #comicbooks , this is a coming-of-age drama revolving around two troubled teenagers, Tandy and Tyrone, who bump into each other, gain super powers, and go on the run. As the trailer also hinted at, the two will find a love for one another during the first season. Is that Roxxon? [Credit: Freeform] \nJust like the CW, Freeform is the home of many dramas and now, with Cloak & Dagger , Freeform can make the #Marvel series a flagship, which is why they decided to drop a teaser already, though the show isn't set to come out next year. Even know the show will focus on drama, we shouldn't be too worried as the CW shows have shown the world how you can mix drama into a YA-oriented superhero show in good ways. \nThe description of the show gives us some more insight on what to expect: \nCloak & Dagger is a coming-of-age series based on the beloved Marvel characters. Tandy Bowen (Olivia Holt) and Tyrone Johnson (Aubrey Joseph) come from starkly different backgrounds, each growing up with a secret they never dared share with another soul. \nOnce a privileged little girl, Tandy Bowen watched as her family was destroyed by a disastrous storm that uprooted her life. Now in her late teens, an unexpected encounter with a boy named Tyrone sparks a life changing event. \nYoung Tyrone Johnson wanted nothing more than to prove he was fearless. But when everything he held close was taken away, life taught Tyrone to be afraid. Now older and more sheltered, Tyrone closes himself off. But when he meets a girl named Tandy his life changes forever. Credit: Marvel \nBesides Holt and Joseph, the cast also includes Andrea Roth ( Blue Bloods ) as Melissa Bowen, Tandy\u2019s mom; Gloria Reuben ( ER ) as Tyrone\u2019s mother, Adina Johnson; Miles Mussenden ( Bloodline ) as Tyrone\u2019s father, Michael Johnson; Carl Lundstedt ( Grey\u2019s Anatomy ) as Liam, Tandy\u2019s partner in crime; James Saito ( Life of Pi ) as Dr. Bernard Sanjo, and J.D.

Along with Jurassic Park opening its gates or Ethan Hunt accepting his impossible mission, the opening crawl is a staple of cinematic tingles. \nEvery Star Wars episode from The Phantom Menace right through to The Force Awakens, has included the cosmic prose. Meanwhile, it was wildly divisive that anthology spin-off Rogue One didn't feature the signature opening crawl; however, not being one of the \"main series\" of films, you can't blame director Gareth Edwards for wanting his film to stand out.

Repeat. Verified Creator. \nAMC released the first poster for the upcoming third season of #FeartheWalkingDead . The new season will premiere in a few months - on June 4, to be exact - but the stakes are high with the new poster. 'Fear The Walking Dead' Season 3: News, Trailers, Release Date & All You Need To Know \nIn the art, Nick (Frank Dillane) is in profile, with La Muerte drawn on his face in blood. The poster's wording is also strong: \"Fear what you become\" is a clear nod to Nick's change of heart in the course of the two previous seasons of Fear the Walking Dead . New art for 'Fear The Walking Dead' Season 3 \nIndeed, if I were anyone in that new survivors' camp, I'd really fear what Nick has and could become. Spending some time among them, Nick has an unique view of how things work in this apocalyptic scenario. Last season, Nick found yet another community who saw the undead not as killable creatures, but as people who were simply awaiting their time to be reborn. Of course, things didn't go according to plan and, once more, Nick was disappointed by those he trusted the most. Nick has been through hell in back in 'Fear The Walking Dead' [Credit: AMC] \nMost notably last season, nstead of simply leaving Alejandro, Luciana, and the others behind, Nick convinced them to try and reach what seemed like a survivors' camp, only to be ambushed and shot at by said survivors. It's fair to say Nick's journey has seen its share of betrayal and awful surprises - none of which Nick seems ever ready to face. But he's found his place amongst the chaos and, most importantly, Nick understands what he needs to do to keep himself and those he loves alive. \nSee Also: ", "crawled": "2017-04-20T07:28:11.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-19T01:51:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "ced3a2c0ba734b4fd489e86f436f4042c3baa073", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 584, "likes": 584}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "moviepilot.com", "participants_count": 0, "site_section": "", "uuid": "ced3a2c0ba734b4fd489e86f436f4042c3baa073", "section_title": "", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 5, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4nXoT4.Lbrg8JVrnUbded.CcyjIzZNtH.xBoUnFRoZkxlTm3ThQxmPuJA2_uTR97E56ij8sMAZ2Vwcu7B2L87", "domain_rank": 2997, "main_image": "https://images.moviepilot.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_630,q_auto:best,w_1200/c5wgrt1dnr4jkyown3sl.jpg", "site_full": "moviepilot.com", "title_full": "'Fear The Walking Dead' Season 3 Poster Hints At Darker Times Ahead | moviepilot.com", "spam_score": 0.292, "title": "'Fear The Walking Dead' Season 3 Poster Hints At Darker Times Ahead | moviepilot.com", "published": "2017-04-19T01:51:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4nXoT4.Lbrg8JVrnUbded.CcyjIzZNtH.xBoUnFRoZkxlTm3ThQxmPuJA2_uTR97E56ij8sMAZ2Vwcu7B2L87", "author": "Pri Figueiredo", "external_links": [], "title": "'Fear The Walking Dead' Season 3 Poster Hints At Darker Times Ahead | moviepilot.com", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Will Melisandre Appear In 'Game Of Thrones' Season 7?

Abraham Ford. With a defiant \"suck my nuts,\" we cowered as Ford became the first casualty of the series and bowed out in a shower of blood and brain matter.

That's the dynamic and the relationship that the two of them had, that Abraham protected Eugene, and now Eugene is seeking protection elsewhere.\" \nCudlitz himself was quick to chime in with \"let's ask Abraham\": \n\"I think he's being very, very true to character. This is exactly the guy I punched in the face at the fire truck. He's staying alive.

When we met the duo back in Season 4, Abraham's sole mission was to get Eugene to Washington under claims that he knew what started the outbreak and could engineer a cure. In classic TWD style, it never was that easy, and the big reveal that Eugene had lied about his job pushed Abraham to breaking point as he K.O.'ed Eugene with a solid punch.

April 18, 2017 at 09:41AM By The Lafayette , writer at creators.co 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' [Credit: Disney / Lucasfilm] By The Lafayette , writer at Creators.co I'm an Entertainment Journalist and novelist, I love Star Wars and anything Superhero related! (Secretly also an Agent of Shield) \nWith the recent release of the teaser trailer for Star Wars: The Last Jedi , there has been a lot of conversation about the concept of \u201cGray Jedi.\u201d This was perpetrated by the following quote in the trailer: \nLuke Skywalker: \"Breath. Just breath. Now, reach out. What do you see?\" \nRey: \"Light. Darkness. A balance.\" Ultimate Guide To 'Star Wars 8: The Last Jedi': News, Trailer, Cast & All You Need To Know \nThis quote seems to indicate that there is much more to The Force then just the Jedi and Sith. Moreover, the two opposing orders may be just the tip of a very large iceberg regarding The Force and its place in the universe. With the mention of balance between the light and darkness in the trailer, many began to wonder if #Disney was bringing in the controversial Gray Jedi. \nThe idea of the Gray Jedi is very prolific in the old Expanded Universe and in the MMO, The Old Republic, which may or may not be in the new canon. Much of the idea of balance \u2014 which is being discussed in the new #StarWars canon under Disney \u2014 has its roots in the philosophy of the Gray Jedi. So, for those who are unfamiliar with the concept here is EVERYTHING you need to know about Gray Jedi. Gray Jedi Is Not A Title 'Star Wars: The Phantom Menace' [Credit: Lucasfilm] \nGray Jedi is not a title for a Jedi knight but rather a description of how they use The Force. Typically, it is used to describe a Jedi that dabbles in both the light and dark side of the force. Gray Jedi call on the dark side of the Force, but are not corrupted by it and do not embrace it entirely. A good example of this is Mace Windu, a Jedi who uses the dark side when in combat but abandons it when the battle is finished. Though it is debated, many have called Qui-Gon Jinn a Gray due to his dabbling in immortality. In fact, Tyvokka once said: \n\"Jinn always does things his own way, always sure he is right, always incredulous if we do not see it his way. Some think he is a Gray Jedi.\" A Gray Jedi Is Still A Jedi 'Star Wars: The Phantom Menace' [Credit: Lucasfilm] \nGray Jedi are not another order like the Sith, they are Jedi who embrace both views of the force and use both dark and light to their advantage. To a Gray Jedi the Force is just the Force; it is the individual that creates the dark side and the light side. In the acclaimed game, Knights of the Old Republic II , Gray Jedi are described as such: \nGray Jedi are those who, though having completed the teachings of the Jedi, operate independently and outside of the Jedi Council. They are typically seen as misguided, though they have not necessarily succumbed to the dark side. Their Use Of The Force 'Star Wars: The Clone Wars' [Credit: Lucasfilm] \nAll Gray Jedi display the use of both light and dark side Force abilities, and demonstrate skill in techniques common to both Jedi and Sith. These included: Force choke, Force lightning, healing, mind tricks, controlling animals and Force throws. While Gray Jedi do not adhere solely to the light side of The Force, they are free from the malevolent influences of the dark side. It is important to distinguish that Jedi who have suffered any corruption from the dark side \u2014 even if they are redeemed \u2014 are not considered to be #GrayJedi . Examples Of Gray Jedi 'Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith' [Credit: Lucasfilm] \nThe Imperial Knights: These were an order of Force practitioners loyal to the Emperor of the Fel Empire. They used the force in combat and leaned towards the light side. The Jedi council tolerated them and viewed them as Gray. \nMace Windu: Mace used a form of lightsaber combat known as Vaapad. It was a form that channeled the dark side in allowing the user to feel the thrill of battle and victory. Windu was the only user to not fall to the dark side of The Force. \nQui-Gon Jinn: It is up for debate if Jinn was truly considered a Gray Jedi. He was at odds with the council for many years and was known to study arts that were frowned upon by the Jedi (such as the path to immortality). \nJolee Bindo: A self-described Gray Jedi, Bindo separated himself from the Jedi council and operated as a smuggler and ally of the former Jedi and Sith Lord Revan. What Does This All Mean? \nThe Gray Jedi sought to expand the understanding of The Force and how it operates. The order was created to show that just because someone was a Jedi or Sith did not make them fully evil or good. It began to show that the Jedi were not all white knights and the Sith were not always the black hats. While much of this information is found in the old canon, Lucasfilm has been converting much of the old Expanded Universe into the new canon. Much of the philosophy of the force found in Star Wars Rebels and in the Force Awakens is from the old canon. \nDo you think that Gray Jedi are coming to the film universe?

Ultimate Guide To 'Star Wars 8: The Last Jedi': News, Trailer, Cast & All You Need To Know \nFirst we hear that Take That frontman Gary Barlow has nabbed himself a role, and now it is the British Royal Family's turn. There has been a persistent rumor since last year that Prince William and Prince Harry will cameo in the film as Stormtroopers. When recently quizzed on the theory, Johnson didn't really do much to deny the news. A Royal Appointment \nIt all stems from a high-profile visit from Kensington Palace to the set of #TheLastJedi in April 2016. Conspiracy theorists also thought that the brothers managed to find time to suit-up as Stormtroopers and slip in a quick cameo before heading back to Buckingham Palace. Johnson has never actually denied it, so Yahoo! Moviesthought they would ask him themselves. \nSpeaking at #StarWars Celebration, Johnson couldn't help but hold back laughter. Smiling while pretending that he was receiving a transmission, Johnson teased: \n\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. I have no clue. The last voice you heard \u2026 I can neither confirm nor deny.\u201d \nIf the heirs to the throne are in Episode VIII , don't expect it to be a part of much significance.

She was nearly nine months pregnant with their daughter, North West , that year, and accentuated her baby bump in a skintight, floral gown and gloves that still has people talking (and cringing).

The ensemble also featured a thigh-high slit that allowed the reality star to show a lot of leg, and it was super sexy. In 2015, she stunned in a sheer, backless, embellished ensemble, and she looked absolutely amazing. \nLast year, Kim shined in a metallic silver gown with a slit , which was perfect for the Age of Technology theme of 2016. She was only five months post-baby here, and has since lost even more weight, so after shedding these last six pounds, her body is totally going to be on point this year.

Once you start rationalizing a little bit and you understand, \u2018Okay, so I\u2019m a little angry or a little down or a little upset about something,\u2019 then you can kind of relativize it and sort of deal with it.\u201d \nWilliam explained that because of the loss he\u2019s suffered he is very passionate about mental health and advocates for those who need help through his Heads Together campaign, which he promotes with wife Princess Kate , 35, and brother Prince Harry , 32. \n\u201cI have my own reasons for being involved in mental health: What happened to me and my mother when I was younger. It all comes back down to mental health,\u201d William says. \nHollywoodLifers , what do you think of William\u2019s thoughts on mental health and the death of his mother Diana?

Spink Rex/Shutterstock \nUPDATED WITH REACTION: J.C. Spink , the Hollywood film producer one half of the management and production company Benderspink , who was a machine when it came to script sales, has died, it was confirmed by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner. No cause of death was released as yet. He was 45. \n\u201cHe was found unresponsive at the scene at the residence on 1200 Green Acre last night at 8:18 PM by his brother,\u201d said the Coroner Ed Winter. \u201cIt was reported to us as possible natural causes, and we are looking into it.\u201d \nSpink and Chris Bender were college roommates who started the management company and built it into a reputable firm before Spink left last May in an acrimonious departure. Spink\u2019s producer credits included The Hangover and The Ring franchises, We\u2019re The Millers, I Am Number Four, Monster-In-Law, The Butterfly Effect, Cats and Dogs and last year\u2019s Criminal starring Kevin Costner and Ryan Reynolds. \nSpink also was an actor, well sort of. He had cameos in two episodes of Adam Goldberg\u2019s hit TV show The Goldbergs . Spink was also a former schoolmate of Goldberg who had actually written a character into the show for him. \u201cEver since we were kids on the school bus, J.C. was a passionate, driven and brilliant guy who put his friends first,\u201d Goldberg said in a statement. \u201cHe mastered the spec game by his 30s, but even more impressive, he gave countless writers a start in the business. One of my best memories on The Goldbergs was when I cast J.C. to play our angry bus driver from our childhood. It was so surreal and incredibly fun. He really will be missed.\u201d \nSpink and Bender dissolved the company after an 18-year run that saw a slew of hits for its swath of A-list writers. We spoke to Spink many times here at Deadline and he was always promoting his clients with passionate enthusiasm. He was extremely well liked around town and affable. He also liked to live on the edge and in the past had some problems with addiction. \n\u201cWe started Benderspink in our late 20s almost 18 years ago,\u201d the pair said in a joint statement at the time of the breakup. \u201cWe could not be more proud of what we\u2019ve worked on together and are excited for the next chapter in each of our lives.\u201d", "crawled": "2017-04-20T06:25:17.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-20T03:54:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "3b690c7d2834920b4a1fe91c0faae24d7b490dfd", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 568, "likes": 568}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "deadline.com", "participants_count": 0, "site_section": "", "uuid": "3b690c7d2834920b4a1fe91c0faae24d7b490dfd", "section_title": "", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 5, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Udv9x6MIntCZn9jXYv3iF84203AuHlo8BkuQdb9Fh8HP1fBRXyGX6PIA3ik7ZVvN4EuH8DwlfaXHDm4y8c9DIAbNGD81lnAUebBMM4GIKsAew--", "domain_rank": 3087, "main_image": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/j-c-spink1.jpg?w=605", "site_full": "deadline.com", "title_full": "J.C.

The media conglomerate has converted some of its classic animated films into live-action movies over the years. And with its latest adaptation in the works, Will Smith may play the Genie in Aladdin , according to Deadline . His background in music makes him the obvious choice, if you ask me. \nAs reported by Deadline , Smith is reportedly currently in talks to play the lovable Genie, a role once made famous by the late Robin Williams . And while Williams' shoes are pretty big to fill, there's certainly no doubt that Smith's comedic timing and musical background more than qualify him for the part. For the few of you who may not know, Jaden and Willow Smith's dad was quite the accomplished rapper prior to bursting onto the acting scene in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air in the early '90s. \nI'm not 100 percent sure, but Smith's addition to the Aladdin cast could perhaps be part of a strategic plan to infuse a bit of hip-hop flair into the whimsical character's persona. And this could be just what the film needs to give the entire movie a much-needed update since it first premiered nearly 25 years ago. Kinda like... Fresh Prince meets Aladdin , you know? I don't know about you, but I'm totally here for it. Giphy \nWhile all of the details surrounding Smith's potential involvement remain unclear, there's one thing that appears to be totally evident: Disney adaptations equal success \u2014 both monetarily and in terms of fan excitement. In less than two months since its release in February of this year, Beauty and the Beast has grossed more than $1 billion worldwide , Vanity Fair reported. \nThe 1992 animated version of Aladdin was also a huge success for the media giant, grossing over $504 million, according to Box Office Mojo. With that said, the live-action adaptation could prove to make out pretty swell at the box office \u2014 that is, if all goes well with the production and casting. Giphy \nIt doesn't hurt that the second coming will be directed by Guy Ritchie , with Jonathan Eirich and Dan Lin serving as producers, The Hollywood Reporter reported. The film is also said to be scripted straight from the original version by John August, so it certainly seems to be lining itself up for success. \nNow, all we need is for Smith to grant us one of our three wishes and sign on to play the magical role.

A flurry of comments followed, reassuring the lady that all will be well. \nMeanwhile, the admins of \u201cApril Giraffe Friends,\u201d who were alerted to the post, decided to take matters into their own hands. They sent her a text on Facebook Messenger. However, the lady did not respond. \nConcerned, the admins managed to pull up the woman\u2019s details from her Facebook page and alerted the police. \nThe cops at Darby Police Department, Pennsylvania, went to the lady\u2019s last known address, but she wasn\u2019t around. After a couple of hours, the police managed to get in touch with her son and his family, who were living in a different jurisdiction. \nSpeaking to the Inquisitr , on condition of anonymity, the admin who alerted the cops said, \u201cThe police got back to me later. The lady wasn\u2019t staying at her son\u2019s place, but the family knew where she was at and they were very concerned about her. She is fine now.\u201d \n\u201cWhat I found strange was the lady had posted many times within that evening\u2014all happy things and then suddenly, this post,\u201d said the admin, who mostly saw posts related to April and the calf. \nFor Carla Pelham, the chief admin of April Giraffe Friends group, tackling the situation was quite challenging. \n\u201cI felt that we had a duty of care to this person. We needed to make sure she was fine. There was no way we could ignore someone who was brave enough to reach out. The police were amazing and told us we had done the right thing and, if we experienced this again, we must report it. They even gave us an update saying that contact was made with the lady. No further details were released to us due to privacy laws,\u201d she said. \nShedding light on people who post suicidal remarks on social media, Prof Jonathan J. Detrixhe, clinical supervisor and adjunct professor at Long Island University, said, \u201cPeople who post their suicidal intentions to strangers, rather than friends and family members, may have no one else to turn to for an intervention \u2014 or they may be looking for a judgement-free place to discuss their interest in suicide.\u201d \nBut social media isn\u2019t the place for that sort of in-depth sharing of complicated feelings, he said. \n\u201cIn my experience with suicidal patients, the situation needs to be directed offline. Friends and family need to respond directly, in person or by phone. The goal would be to validate the person\u2019s feelings,\u201d he said. \nIt\u2019s not just the old people who display suicidal tendencies online. \nAccording to Angela Robinson Giuffra, a licensed clinical social worker, even teens and young adults take to social media to express their frustration or thoughts of suicide. \u201cAs an adolescent and young adult specialist, I have seen the isolating effects of social media use on this population. Depressed, anxious young people who are withdrawn and not engaged in the outside world take to the internet. They use Youtube for entertainment and chat rooms for supports groups for mental health disorders, etc. They come to see the internet as their connection to the outside world,\u201d she said. \nIn an effort to help people with suicidal tendencies, Facebook recently launched a new set of tools. \n\u201cWhen someone is thinking of suicide or hurting themselves, we already have tools that let friends reach out directly or report a post to us so we can help. But with billions of posts, comments and messages every day, we\u2019re limited by what people actually report to us. As a result, there have been terribly tragic events \u2014 including suicides, some live streamed \u2014 that might have been prevented if someone had realized what was happening earlier,\u201d said Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder and CEO.

We\u2019re giving people the ability to chat directly with someone from organizations like Crisis Text Line, Lifeline, and the National Eating Disorder Association,\u201d Zuckerberg said.", "crawled": "2017-04-20T05:38:11.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-20T05:38:11.000+03:00", "uuid": "a30a02d9dce586da7ea9b2a44803e06957db3029", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 5, "shares": 824, "likes": 824}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "inquisitr.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://feeds.inquisitr.com/google/yDYq", "uuid": "a30a02d9dce586da7ea9b2a44803e06957db3029", "section_title": "The Inquisitr", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 8, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.aTy_RdLlSNb2SUNTXcjQ3DlMZK58mIQ9D.Oh5kO.asK3qQz.wHiNRpr_rZyF6y6vKSgoT_Pb8Z13KFDDXk.QaZzMyC7k.EEUJS.5k1kVTqsrH9W1XaX2uIzzIywH1gSpSfoYi86RDWquoHOay3SM_vFL9nMC5J3w-", "domain_rank": 2130, "main_image": "http://cdn.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Facebook-suicide-April-giraffe--900x440.jpg", "site_full": "www.inquisitr.com", "title_full": "Facebook Group Dedicated To April The Giraffe Averts Suicide Attempt, Saves Woman\u2019s Life", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Facebook Group Dedicated To April The Giraffe Averts Suicide Attempt, Saves Woman\u2019s Life", "published": "2017-04-20T05:38:11.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "pennsylv"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "inquisitr"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "pennsylvania"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "caroline diana"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "jonathan j. detrixhe"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "mark zuckerberg"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "carla pelham"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "jonny fantastico"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "tysen benz"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "zuckerberg"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "angela robinson giuffra"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "facebook group"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "darby police department"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "long island university"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "facebook"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "national eating disorder association"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "facebook messenger"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.aTy_RdLlSNb2SUNTXcjQ3DlMZK58mIQ9D.Oh5kO.asK3qQz.wHiNRpr_rZyF6y6vKSgoT_Pb8Z13KFDDXk.QaZzMyC7k.EEUJS.5k1kVTqsrH9W1XaX2uIzzIywH1gSpSfoYi86RDWquoHOay3SM_vFL9nMC5J3w-", "author": "Caroline Diana", "external_links": [], "title": "Facebook Group Dedicated To April The Giraffe Averts Suicide Attempt, Saves Woman\u2019s Life", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "The same day as former New England Patriots star Aaron Hernandez hanged himself in his prison cell while serving a life sentence for the 2011 murder of Odin Lloyd , members of his former team \u2013 Super Bowl LI champs \u2013 are headed to the White House.\nHernandez was found unresponsive in his cell at Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Lancaster, Massachusetts, about 3 a.m. Wednesday, according to a statement from the state Department of Correction.\n\u201cMr. Hernandez was in a single cell in a general population unit,\u201d the statement reads. \u201c[He] hanged himself utilizing a bedsheet that he attached to his cell window.

So, I took a job in the Public Affairs Bureau at the State Department out of grad school.

Throughout the video, Kendrick is dressed in a Kung Fu Kenny costume\u2014an homage to Cheadle\u2019s character from the 2001 movie Rush Hour 2 . Today, Cheadle spoke to Pitchfork over the phone about his appearance in the video, how he had two days to learn the lyrics, the ad-libbed dialogue from the video, his text conversations with Kendrick, the time he offered Kendrick an acting job, and how he only just figured out that he\u2019s the inspiration behind Kung Fu Kenny. \nPitchfork: You obviously learned the trumpet for your portrayal of Miles Davis in last year's biopic Miles Ahead. How did you prepare to rap in a Kendrick video? \nDon Cheadle: Well, it was a very different process. I didn\u2019t have to figure out how to play anything like I did for Miles Ahead . As opposed to about eight years to try to figure out the movie and get ready for that, I had two days to get ready for the video. Kendrick just hit me out of the blue and just said, \u201cHey man, I\u2019m going to do this video, do you wanna be in it?\u201d And I said, \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d And then he said, \u201cDo you want to know what the part is?\u201d He was like, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re gonna come in and play a cop, and you\u2019re interrogating me, and then you\u2019re just gonna spit my rap.\u201d \nI was like, \u201cUh OK, you know you\u2019re like the best rapper in the world, so what are you talking about.\u201d He sent me the lyrics and was like, \u201cYou just have to get this much of it down,\u201d which was like half of it [ laughs ]. I was like, \u201cAre you gonna have a teleprompter?\u201d And he said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s gonna be fine.\u201d \nSo I crammed like we have to do as actors. It\u2019s tricky, because it\u2019s not a linear process. His thought process is not linear. That was probably the trickiest part of it\u2014to figure out how thoughts led to each other. As a human being, he\u2019s pretty normal and straight ahead, but when you listen to his rhymes, he\u2019s constructing ideas in ways that are not immediately understandable. It takes a deep dive to kind of figure out why one verse creates the other verse and what it comes out of and all of that. So it\u2019s tricky to memorize because it\u2019s so specific to the way he thinks. But then when we got in there, we really just started playing. We just started improvising, really. \nIt\u2019s crazy that you only had two days. I wondered if you had this album weeks before everybody. \nNo. I literally had that song. They sent me that and said, \u201cCan you do it?\u201d And they sent me a couple of video clips of him literally just sitting in a trailer, just kind of moving. They said, \u201cWe want you to get his movements, \u2019cause you\u2019re kind of going to be mirroring him at some point.\u201d So they sent me a couple clips of the way he moved and him doing the rhyme, just really casual and laid back. And then we showed up and it happened really fast because they had the entire rest of that video they had to shoot with cars and all of that stuff. So we just kind of improv\u2019d it. The cameras moved around a lot. Nabil, who directed it, was just really clever about how to cover it. We did it like five or six times and that was it. \nThe part where you ask if he knows what \u201cDNA\u201d stands for\u2014was that something you came up with or was that Kendrick? \nThat was me. He just said, \u201cYou\u2019re a cop, and you\u2019re going to be messing with him and getting in his face. So just fuck with him.\u201d So I said, \u201cOK, well this would be a pretty fucked up thing to say\u201d [ laughs ]. So I just improv\u2019d all the dialogue, everything I said. I did it once, and after we finished it, Kendrick was like, \u201cYeah, say that again. Say exactly that. Do that one again.\u201d \nDid you see that Geraldo criticized Kendrick again ? \nKendrick sent that to me. It\u2019s just hilarious. It\u2019s like, \u201cWow dude, you don\u2019t have anything better to do? That\u2019s not your lane, bro.\u201d \nYou introduced Kendrick\u2019s amazing performance at the Grammys last year. What was it like being right there? \nIt was amazing, and again, it was a complete surprise. I was walking the red carpet and everybody was saying, \u201cHave you seen it? Do you know what he\u2019s going to do?\u201d And I was like, \u201cNo.\u201d It did not disappoint. \nRight before I announced it, they stuck me somewhere\u2014I had to go stand somewhere before I walked on stage\u2014and Robert Glasper just happened to be standing in front of me. Neither one of us knew, and as soon as it was over, he just turned around and looked at me, and we just stared at each other for 10 seconds. Like, \u201cWhat did we just see?\u201d Incredible. \nDid you already know Kendrick before then? \nDre had connected us because I wanted to use Kendrick in some project I was doing\u2014his music, for sure. I maybe wanted him to try his hand at acting, which he was very reticent to do at that time. He didn\u2019t feel like that was his lane and said he wasn\u2019t ready. I really appreciated that, because a lot of people are like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d just because they want that shine. He was like, \u201cNah, I don\u2019t do anything unless I know I can do it.\u201d \nBut we just stayed in touch from that point on. We texted, \u201cHey what\u2019s happening,\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201coh I\u2019m on tour, I\u2019m working on this music.\u201d I\u2019d be somewhere and I\u2019d get a text just out of the blue saying, \u201cwhat\u2019s up big bro, what\u2019s happening.\u201d So we just kind of stayed in touch like that over a couple years, and then a month ago, he said, \u201cOh I\u2019m gonna do this video, do you wanna do it?\u201d \nWhat\u2019s your take on the second half of the video? It shows this much more varied life than Geraldo or whoever is saying Kendrick represents. What\u2019s your take on what the video means? \nI loved it. I love the whole video. Like I said, to me, he is real. He\u2019s just real and straight-up and honest and truthful and generous to the degree that he lets you in. He lets you see the cracks in the armor. He lets you see his insecurities and all that stuff. It\u2019s just rare to have any kind of artist do that\u2014especially a hip-hop artist. He\u2019s kind of the anti-hip-hop artist in that way. \nWhat thoughts do you have about the rest of the album? \nI haven\u2019t heard it! I didn\u2019t even know that I was the Kung Fu Kenny model. I didn\u2019t know that until the next day. He got that from my character in Rush Hour 2 . He was like, \u201cDuh!\u201d He texted me like, \u201cDude are you serious? You didn\u2019t know that?\u201d I totally forgot about that. I\u2019ve been working too long, I didn\u2019t even remember that. \nHe\u2019s dressed like your character, right? \nYes! When he hit me, before the video, he said, \u201cThe video, it\u2019s gonna be here, and I\u2019ve got a little surprise for you.\u201d I was like, \u201cCool.\u201d So I showed up, I did the thing, then I left, and I did not put it together. Then I went to Coachella and saw him perform, and I saw the video before the thing and still didn\u2019t figure it out. And then I went on Twitter and someone had randomly tweeted, \u201cDon Cheadle is the original Kung Fu Kenny.\u201d I went, \u201cWait a minute, I did play a character named Kenny who did kung fu and spoke Chinese.\u201d \nAnd I texted Kendrick and was like, \u201cHey man, am I the inspiration for Kung Fu Kenny? Because I\u2019m going to say I am whether I am or not.\u201d He was like, \u201cFam, that was the surprise. So, surprise!\u201d Oh shit! I feel stupid now. \nI wonder what he was thinking the whole two days when we were together and I hadn\u2019t said anything about it. He was like, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this dude? Is he senile? Does he hate it? Is he not a fan?\u201d It was obvious. Now, when you say it, it\u2019s obvious. \nYou talked about Kendrick and Kamasi Washington while you did press for Miles Ahead , and you worked with Robert Glasper. How do you find new music? \nThrough them. It\u2019s kind of like how Joseph Campbell talked about how he became a scholar. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m a scholar, but he\u2019d read all the people he liked and then he\u2019d go and read all the people that they read. Then he\u2019d read that person and see who that person read. That\u2019s kind of how it is. I look at the people that Rob has worked with. You look at the tracks and see who the people are. You find them and what their music is and who they\u2019ve worked with. It just kind of works like that.

[1] The series is a satirical parody of a middle class American lifestyle, epitomized by its family of the same name: Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. The show is set in the fictional town of Springfield, named for the town in Oregon [11] ; however, the state the show takes place in is never revealed (this is one of the show\u2019s running gags). The show parodies American culture, society, television and many aspects of the human condition. History \nThe family was conceived by Groening shortly before a pitch for a series of animated shorts with the producer James L. Brooks. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of The Tracey Ullman Show on April 19th, 1987. After a three-season run, the cartoon was developed into a half-hour primetime show and was an early hit for FOX , becoming the network\u2019s first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989\u20131990). [1] Reception \nSince its debut on December 17th, 1989, the show has broadcast over 600 episodes; the twenty-eight season started airing on September 25th, 2016. The Simpsons is the longest-running American sitcom, the longest-running American animated program, and in 2009 it surpassed Gunsmoke as the longest-running American primetime, scripted television series. The Simpsons Movie , a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on July 26 and July 27th, 2007, and grossed over $527 million. \nThe Simpsons has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 27 Primetime Emmy Awards, 27 Annie Awards and a Peabody Award. Time Magazine\u2019s December 31st, 1999 issue named it the 20th century\u2019s best television series, and on January 14th, 2000 the Simpson family was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Homer\u2019s exclamatory catchphrase \u201cD\u2019oh!\u201d has been adopted into the English language, while The Simpsons has influenced many adult-oriented animated sitcoms. Online Presence \nThe Simpsons also has a robust online presence. The Simpsons Facebook page currently has more than 66.2 million likes. [13] Launched on August 13th, 2012, The Simpsons twitter account, @The Simpsons, currently has over 884,000 followers. On May 15th, 2016, the show fielded questions via Twitter to be incorporated into a live segment of the show, in which Homer answered questions in real time. [12] Simpsons World \nOn October 21st, 2014, Fox\u2019s cable network FX launched \u201cSimpsons World,\u201d allowing FX subscribers to stream every episode to stream every episode of the show via their FXNow App. Early in its release, fans criticized \u201cSimpsons World\u201d for not presenting the show in the proper aspect ratios and the time and length of commercial breaks, which altered the content of the show. FX eventually updated the app, giving users the option to view in their original aspect ratio. [1] Fandom \nSince the show is so ubiquitous, its fandom is not internet-based, although it is so large that it does has a significant online presence. The show has been around since the internet started becoming widely public in the early \u201990s, so its influence has been consistently felt throughout the history of the internet. \nThere are several Simpsons fan sites around the internet, but the majority of the online presence of the show is thanks to the frequent use of catchphrases, image macros, and YouTube clips. Frinkiac \nOn February 2nd, 2016, web developers Paul Kehrer, Sean Schultz, and Allie Young launched the Frinkiac, [14] a massive database of every shot and line from seasons 1 through 17 of the show. The site allows users to type in quotes and pinpoint the scene it comes from. They can then make memes or gifs based on the line. Newsweek said, \u201cIt may be the greatest feat of Internet engineering we\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d [15] Impact \nThroughout its history, The Simpsons has been on the forefront of American pop culture, thanks to its witty writing and fearless parodying of current events and politics, as well as its consistent references to contemporary and historical pop culture and cult icons (such as Charles Bronson). The show has garnered controversy, brought to a head when in 1992 the then-US president George H. W. Bush remarked \u201c[we want] to make American families a lot more like the Waltons and a lot less like the Simpsons.\u201d Arguably, this only increased interest in the show. The Simpsons has become an icon of American culture, and has had a lasting impact on society over its long run; many of its neologisms (such as D\u2019oh!, meh, yoink!, and crap-tacular) [1] and catchphrases are frequently used on- and off-line, and its characters are easily recognized all over the world. Related Memes \u201cMilhouse Is Not A Meme\u201d \nMilhouse is not a meme is a paradoxical statement and a well-known debate on the imageboard site 4chan about what constitutes an internet meme and what doesn\u2019t. The meme uses an image of the character Milhouse Van Houten, who in and of himself is not a meme \u2013 that is to say, Milhouse is not a meme, but \u201cMilhouse is not a meme\u201d is, in fact, a meme. Chalkboard Gag Parodies \nChalkboard Gag Parodies are a series of exploitable images based on the perennial chalkboard gag scene from The Simpsons \u2019 opening sequence. In the scene, Bart is seen repeatedly writing a message on a large chalkboard, as a form of punishment. In each episode, the text is changed, and is frequently a joke or pun. The exploitable is a natural extension of this, with users adding their own text. The Goggles Do Nothing! \nThe Goggles Do Nothing! is a catchphrase used for conveying the horror of having seen something unwanted, another way of saying \u201ccannot unsee.\u201d The quote was used in the Season 7 episode \u201cRadioactive Man,\u201d in which Rainier Wolfcastle, playing the action hero Radioactive Man, is doused with sulfuric acid while being protected only by a pair of goggles. As the acid eats through he clothes, he screams \u201cMy eyes! The goggles do nothing!\u201d Redundant Adjectives are Redundant! \n*(X) (Y) is is a common sentence structure derived from a scene in the Season 11 episode \u201cThe Grift of the Magi,\u201d in which Ralph excitedly says \u201cfun toys are fun!\u201d Use of the phrase online started with 4chan; it is often used to place a humorous emphasis on redundancy. Popular examples include \u201cLongcat is l ng\u201d, \u201cSuccessful troll is successful\u201d and \u201cOld pic is old.\u201d It has become a common phrase across the imageboards and the internet in general. I Must Go \nI Must Go, My People/Planet Need(s) Me is a caption frequently used on image macros showing people or animals jumping or flying away. The phrase originated in the Season 8 episode \u201cThe Itchy & Scratchy & Poochie Show,\u201d in which a character (Poochie), voiced by Homer, and introduced into the long-running cartoon \u201cItchy & Scratchy,\u201d is killed off. The caption first attained spread through demotivational posters \", and has since spread to other image macros. Stupid Sexy Flanders \nStupid Sexy Flanders is a phrase that comes from the Season 11 episode \u201cLittle Big Mom,\u201d spoken by Homer as he tries to think about what an skiing instructor said, but instead can\u2019t get the image of Flanders\u2019 skintight ski suit out of his mind. It has a similar usage on forums to \u201ccannot unsee,\u201d although it is generally used in situations where the viewer is secretly enthralled by the supposedly undesirable object, as opposed to being outright disgusted. It is also frequently used in YouTube parodies of the scene. I, For One, Welcome Our New X Overlords \nI, For One, Welcome Our New X Overlords - is a catchphrase from the Season 5 episode \u201cDeep Space Homer.\u201d It is spoken by news anchor Kent Brockman after he sees a video, transmitted from Homer\u2019s space mission, that shows ants flying around in the cabin of the spacecraft; the ants appear super-sized because they are close to the lens, which spooks Kent. The phrase is commonly used to comment facetiously on someone\u2019s or something\u2019s perceived control of a situation, and is one of the oldest and most well-established Simpsons -related memes. That\u2019s The Joke. \nThat\u2019s the Joke is a catchphrase originating from the Season 6 episode \u201cA Star is Burns.\u201d In it, Rainier Wolfcastle is being interviewed about his new stand-up comedy movie, and a clip is shown (see below). In the clip, Wolfcastle says \u201cDid you ever notice how men always leave the toilet seat up? [\u2026] That\u2019s the joke.\u201d The catchprase, often accompanied by an image of Wolfcastle looking serious in front of the brick wall (again, see above), is used to condescendingly explain the punchline of a joke, or is itself the punchline to an otherwise-unfunny remark. That\u2019s a Paddlin\u2019 \nThat\u2019s a Paddlin\u2019 (or X? That\u2019s a Paddlin\u2019) is a catchphrase/copypasta from the Season 6 episode \u201cThe PTA Disbands,\u201d in which local resident Jasper Beardly takes over teaching 2nd Grade at Springfield Elementary. He uses the phrase when outlining his classroom policies; for example, \u201cTalking out of turn? That\u2019s a paddlin\u2019.\u201d In the show, the phrase was intended to comment on the antiquated notion of corporal punishment in public schools, but online it has come to be used as a joke about authority and strange rules. The phrase is also used in various other snowclones, and the action of \u201cPaddlin\u2019\u201d has come to be associated with Jasper\u2019s image. Dental Plan / Lisa Needs Braces \nDental Plan / Lisa Needs Braces is a call-and-response template that peaked in popularity on 4chan in 2008. It originates from the Season 4 episode \u201cLast Exit to Springfield,\u201d in which Homer hears the words \u201cDental Plan\u201d (spoken by Lenny) and \u201cLisa Needs Braces\u201d (spoken by Marge) repeatedly in his head while his brain tries to connect the loss of his dental insurance with his having to pay out-of-pocket for Lisa\u2019s braces. Its online use is mostly related to the phrase\u2019s extremely repetitive and catchy nature; it is frequently used as an interruptor, either by repeating the phrase, or by repeating captioned images. The phrase has also been used in various YouTube remixes. Do It For Her \nDo It For Her is a photoshop meme originating from the Season 6 episode \u201cAnd Maggie Makes Three.\u201d The original image shows a placard in Homer\u2019s office reading \u201cDON\u2019T FORGET , YOU\u2019RE HERE FOREVER \u201d, over which Homer has plastered images of Maggie, so it reads \u201cDO IT FOR HER \u201d, referring to how he returned to his job in order to support her future. The meme usually involves photoshopping images of other characters in place of Maggie, such as Hatsune Miku .

Old Man Yells at Cloud \nOld Man Yells At Cloud is an exploitable image of a gag headline featured in a 2002 episode of The Simpsons . On the Internet, the newspaper clip of Abe Simpson angrily raising his fist under the literal headline \u201cOld Man Yells at Cloud\u201d has been repurposed into a series of reaction images for commentaries on various topics based on the phrasal template (X) Yells at (Y). Now Do Classical Gas \nNow Do Classical Gas is a quote from The Simpsons character Lenny in the episode \u201cLast Exit to Springfield.\u201d In the scene, Lenny asks Lisa, who is playing acoustic guitar, to play the piece \u201cClassical Gas\u201d by Mason Williams.

Posted on Share \nFairfax reports Amazon is already actively looking for warehouse spaces \u2013 measuring up to 93,000 square metres \u2013 to house a fulfillment centre. A fulfillment centre is basically what Amazon calls the big ol' warehouse it uses to store and ship products. There's been no decision on which city headquarters will be in, according to Fairfax. \nA country manager will also be hired, as well as hundreds of other employees to flesh out the Aussie expansion. \nAustralians have already been able to use an Australian Kindle store on the Amazon website, which launched in 2012, and there are already almost 1000 employees in the country. \n\"The next step is to bring a retail offering to Australia and we are making those plans now,\" Amazon said in a statement. \nAmazon's retail expansion will come as good news to small business owners, while existing, larger retailers will no doubt be worried by the online marketplace's effect here. Macy's, Walmart and larger stores across America have all closed hundreds of stores in the wake of Amazon's (and other online outlets') domination of the retail industry.

Serena Williams' Journey From Drake Drama to Under-the-Radar Happiness By E! Illustration \nCongratulations are in order for Serena Williams , but for more than it seems. \nFirst, the obvious. The tennis star announced yesterday, via a quickly-vanishing Snapchat, that she is expecting a baby with fianc\u00e9 Alex Ohanian. We'll pause here for the obligatory slow claps and champagne pops. Beyond the incredibly happy baby news, this new milestone marks the culmination of a full romantic turnaround for Williams. It wasn't long ago that she was embroiled in the tabloid drama that comes with associating with none other than Drake . Yet, in barely more than a year, she started a journey to complete happiness that is (almost) as impressive as her many Grand Slam wins. \nLet's start at the beginning. Drake and Williams were first outed as a rumored couple in August 2015, when they were photographed getting cozy in a Cincinnati restaurant. Drake had previously been spotting sitting courtside at one of her tennis matches, which stirred a bit of speculation, but it wasn't until the prophetic paparazzi photos dropped that the rumors about the twosome really ramped up. Photos \nSerena Williams' Best Looks \nDrake and Williams had been friends for quite some time, and at the time of the Great Cincinnati Cuddle-Off E! News learned that they had been dating for about a month. The relationship was instant tabloid fodder and the Twitterverse, naturally, exploded. From that point on pretty much nothing that they did as a couple could be kept a secret. \nAccording to E!'s sources, they initially tried to keep a low profile as they were both \"private people when it came to their personal lives,\" but it didn't work out well at all. It was, for lack of a better term, a media circus for the ages. \nThey were photographed together everywhere they went, from his restaurant opening in Toronto to dates out on the town to front row at her New York Fashion Week show. Perhaps the most infamous example was the 2015 US Open semifinal match, an egregious case of the entire public totally missing the point. Drake was seated front row at the big match\u2014as any supposed boyfriend would do\u2014but the second that Drizzy was spotted in the house, attention immediately shifted to the rapper and his relationship with Williams. \nThe tennis star ended up losing that tournament in straight sets (that's tennis speak for a very bad match), and fans immediately accused Drake of distracting her. The rumors and accusations went flying\u2014as did the hashtags\u2014in half-joking, half-serious manners, but it was all absurd nonetheless. So absurd, in fact, that over a year later Serena felt compelled to address it in a cover interview for Glamour . \nThen, in almost as much of a surprise fashion as the Drake-Serena relationship began, the two were done. Over. Kaput. As anyone who's had a Hollywood breakup will tell you, being constantly followed and critiqued in a relationship does not a sustainable coupling make. Sadly for Williams, it wasn't the first time she had learned such a lesson. Her previous relationship with rapper Common had been splashed across the front pages of every glossy in the grocery aisle, and their ensuing dramatic breakup was even more widespread. \nBut there was almost no time to mourn for Serena, because she had met someone new. And this time it was a guy that she (and everyone else) could take seriously. \nEnter Alexis Ohanian . Make that: Enter in secret . \nSince the tennis player and the Reddit co-founder got together, they have been operating in the exact opposite fashion from what we'd come to expect from one of the sports world's biggest stars. They never made an official \"we're dating\" announcement. They were (almost) never photographed together. In fact, the only reason anyone even knew they were together from the start is on account of their friend's overly chatty tendencies.

When Simon failed to make good on his promise to propose and pay her back, they went their separate ways. \n\"I found that ring that I kept thinking that you we're going to get it and reimburse me for it,\" she quips, to which Simon responds, \"You're still bringing that up, huh?\" \n\"I'm not going to be hung up on somebody who's not really going to commit,\" Abraham continues. \nTo find out how Farrah and Simon's blowout ends, watch the clip above! \nTeen Mom OG airs Monday nights at 9 p.m. on MTV.

At best, The Vinson episode suggests policy gaps between the president and his top military advisers over how to act toward North Korea. Worse, it appears the president has not firmly established control over the chain of command\u2014or that he possibly overdelegated authority to his generals and admirals. Further, this incident sends deeply disturbing signals to allies and adversaries regarding the president\u2019s control over the military and the credibility of his statements, diluting the deterrent value of American words and actions. Advertisement \nLet\u2019s start with two fundamental premises of U.S. civil-military relations. First, the president is the elected commander in chief of the military; short of declaring war, he has the power to order military deployments and operations, and be held politically accountable for them. Second, the president ought to know with accuracy the locations and readiness of major U.S. military assets, and have the ability to command those forces as needed to protect the country. \nAny departure from these norms stands out as potentially threatening to national security. When, in 2007, the Air Force lost track of nuclear weapons and inadvertently allowed them to fly over the continental United States mounted on a bomber, then\u2013Defense Secretary Robert Gates rightfully saw the incident as an abomination and fired the Air Force leadership. Get Slate in your inbox. \nIn the case of the Vinson , any movement toward similar accountability starts in a complete muddle. Did President Trump and Press Secretary Sean Spicer deliberately mislead the public with their statements about the carrier\u2019s whereabouts? Were they misinformed by the Pentagon? Or were they carelessly freelancing with their comments to be more bellicose toward Korea? Any of these scenarios is fraught with peril; all depart from established norms of civil-military relations that dictate the president speak with authority and accuracy about the military forces he commands. It\u2019s also unclear who, exactly, ordered the Vinson and its battle group to steam toward North Korea, let alone whether that was fully coordinated with the Pentagon or other parts of the government. \nOne possibility is that U.S. Pacific Command, led by Adm. Harry Harris, ordered the Vinson maneuvers to create options for the White House in anticipation of a tougher policy on Korea. The sequence of events bears this out, given that Harris\u2019 announcement preceded any notice from the White House or Pentagon, suggesting there was little coordination in advance. This accords with the general hawkishness of Pacific Command on issues relating to China and North Korea\u2014hawkishness which differed greatly from the Obama administration. This scenario would align with President Trump\u2019s recent aloofness toward his role in the chain of command, as well as the preferences of top advisers like Steve Bannon and H.R. McMaster, who, respectively, want to \u201c de-operationalize \u201d the National Security Council and implement a \u201c mission command \u201d style of direction for the military. The recent delegation of authority to commanders overseeing the Afghanistan war\u2014who, in turn, decided to drop the \u201cMassive Ordnance Air Blast\u201d bomb in ISIS fighters near the Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan border\u2014fits this pattern as well. Advertisement \nA second possibility is that the Trump administration, perhaps led by Defense Secretary James Mattis, ordered the carrier move. If so, this does not represent a civil-military relations problem per se; ordering around aircraft carriers is unquestionably a presidential prerogative. However, it does highlight weaknesses in the White House\u2019s competence and expertise in the use of military force. The disconnects between the White House and Pentagon statements suggest a lack of close coordination, much less any substantive follow-up such as complementary movement of air and ground forces. (Although troop movements are generally kept classified, significant moves like these are hard to conceal, and they are often publicized because there is greater deterrent value in making such moves openly.) This lack of coordination isn\u2019t helped by the unfilled appointments throughout the Trump administration, nor the infancy of the administration itself, which makes the whole enterprise function as something less than a \u201c fine-tuned machine .\u201d In Moscow and Beijing, President Trump\u2019s word now carries less force. \nSimilarly, it\u2019s unclear whether McMaster or Mattis fully played out the scenario surrounding the Vinson \u2019s dispatch and the potential commitment of two other carriers to the waters near Korea. Sending three carriers to the Western Pacific deprives the Navy\u2014with its 11 total carriers\u2014of the ability to rotate carriers through other missions, including support for the actual wars being fought in Iraq/Syria and Afghanistan. Just as the Army and Marines surged in Iraq and Afghanistan during tough fighting periods, so too can the Navy surge its carrier groups in a crisis\u2014but it cannot maintain this posture indefinitely. And although President Trump pledged to build a larger Navy during the campaign, he can\u2019t build one overnight, or possibly even during his presidency . Trump\u2019s impulsive and seemingly uncoordinated commitment of a carrier here could constrain his options for years to come. \nThe Vinson episode also illustrates, once again, how questions about the president\u2019s truthfulness can have adverse strategic consequences. Our friends and allies, including South Korea , can hardly take comfort in knowing the American cavalry is coming when the administration speaks so cavalierly. Conversely, America\u2019s adversaries listen to every presidential word\u2014whether he wants to be taken literally or not. They also check those words against their intelligence, gathered via their own satellites, spies, and other means. The Russians and Chinese watch the Vinson \u2019s movements closely and surely noticed the gap between the statements from Pacific Command, the Pentagon, and the White House. Bluffing works in statecraft, but only when your opponent can\u2019t see your cards. In Moscow and Beijing, President Trump\u2019s word now carries less force because he has devalued it by making statements that are demonstrably untrue about the deployment of American military forces. Top Comment \nThis is from Kevin D Williamson, A right wing Writer at National Review: Every day, the incoherence deepens: He\u2019s going to cover \u201ceveryone,\u201d but he\u2019s going to push 24 million people off their health insurance.

But if we are indeed headed for a major crisis like the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis or the 1994 showdown with North Korea over nukes, then it matters greatly that the White House, Pentagon, and Pacific Command are marching to the beats of separate drummers. Imagine if, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the military had inadvertently moved forces in Europe to create options for the Kennedy administration or otherwise signaled hostile intent to the Soviets. That crisis might have ended far differently, with potentially catastrophic consequences. \nThe presidency\u2019s national security responsibilities are too complex to be handled like a family real-estate business or reality television show . President Trump and his advisers need to communicate much more clearly with each other, and he must personally exercise greater control over the forces he commands, or else his presidency (and possibly the world ) will end in disaster. \nPhillip Carter is a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security and adjunct professor of law at Georgetown University.

Informal egg roll parties were recorded at the White House during the early Lincoln administration.\nDuring the post-Civil War years, the Easter egg games were played on the grounds surrounding the U.S. Capitol Building. In 1876, an act of Congress outlawed the Capitol grounds and terraces from being used as playgrounds to protect the property from destruction. In 1878, President Rutherford B. Hayes officially opened the White House grounds to local children for egg rolling on Easter Monday.\nDuring World War I and II, the events were canceled. Dwight D. Eisenhower and First Lady Mamie Eisenhower revived the event in 1953 after a 12-year absence. In 1969, Pat Nixon's staff introduced the White House Easter Bunny, a staffer dressed in a white fleece bunny costume who roamed the grounds and welcomed the egg rollers and posed for photographs. By 1974 the activities evolved into organized egg-rolling races. The 1981 eggstravaganza included assorted clowns and characters, balloon vendors, Broadway show vignettes, a petting zoo, exhibits of antique cars, and an eggxposition of specially decorated eggs (one for each state). Each egg roller received a goody bag filled with a program, toy products supplied by corporate sponsors, and food- whose wrappers littered the lawn. Since 1987 the event's theme has been inscripted on each egg, and by 1989 George and Barbara Bush added their facsimile signatures. Today the official eggs are given one to a child (under 12) as they leave the South Lawn.\nRead More About Easter in Washington, DC\nRelated Articles Washington, DC's 2017 Major Annual Events Celebrating Easter in Washington, DC Easter in the United States Explore the White House Gardens on a Public Tour Fun Easter Egg Hunts Near Washington, DC Learn About Washington DC's Pro Sports Teams Our Expert Recommends Spring Family Fun in the DC Area 15 Best Places to Go with Kids in the DC Area Top 10 Things to Do in the DC Area Easter Brunch in Washington, DC Spring Break in Washington, DC National Cherry Blossom Festival Best Museums for Kids in Washington DC April Festivals and Events in Washington DC May Festivals and Events in Washington DC Washington, Holidays/Seasonal Events White House Easter Egg Roll 2017: Tickets, Talent & More ", "crawled": "2017-04-20T03:12:12.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "1f2d528bdb0c20250350c92846e7a6c6b95bc386", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 984, "likes": 984}, "gplus": {"shares": 26}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 9}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}}, "country": "US", "site": "about.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://dc.about.com/", "uuid": "1f2d528bdb0c20250350c92846e7a6c6b95bc386", "section_title": "Washington DC Travel - A Guide to the DC Capital Region", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 9, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Ue2ovhVfnF1D9SA__6_49aESrlmlLkYjVFgLwjWaJU97RWzDU4xovAr9XMnmFcEsGNjbEvIG7_twFiHo7v_kLA5", "domain_rank": 238, "main_image": "http://fthmb.tqn.com/stCpuzs7mVILFS9xc5p2ltdUfqs=/640x0/filters:no_upscale()/about/White-House-Easter-56a236bf5f9b58b7d0c7f711.jpg", "site_full": "dc.about.com", "title_full": "White House Easter Egg Roll 2017: Tickets, Talent & More", "spam_score": 0.005, "title": "White House Easter Egg Roll 2017: Tickets, Talent & More", "published": "2017-04-17T03:00:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Ue2ovhVfnF1D9SA__6_49aESrlmlLkYjVFgLwjWaJU97RWzDU4xovAr9XMnmFcEsGNjbEvIG7_twFiHo7v_kLA5", "author": "Rachel Cooper", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/+aboutdotcom", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/oYzpiARhtxGpQeyrSaU7ax2jwAQ=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/ParkHyattStKitts-58b2e7d45f9b5860466bac6c.jpg", "https://www.pinterest.com/aboutcomtravel/", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/tc9olltZDWIsnC-lpqpHGdcIjOs=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/capitol-building-170402241-58ddb7bf5f9b58468374c174.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/dos5cAktIxswAe8PhAgGW-BdTG0=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/GettyImages-124846685-589394d65f9b5874ee0312d4.jpg", "https://twitter.com/abouttravel", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/XIxTHATVZBzII49_HCZ3uCOW8KE=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/GettyImages-580470451-58b6e55b5f9b58604653eb93.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/gUX0Ao8BKEZApmnFRPG1vqpmBIQ=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/GettyImages-154917476-58b4b0e25f9b5860466f84fb.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/ZiY_kfxwIggjWClkBSXr9ztiwm4=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/GettyImages-148636845-58c2e1fa3df78c353c0c3cdd.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/hqNB_4tRQ2YBIW_e3MxKo5aWMDA=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/Cherry-Blossoms-56a239785f9b58b7d0c80d7a.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/QzeTKXfwH7Sgu3HurED0Aj4EKNM=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/DC-58e3adf23df78c5162fea85a.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/sO6iA4Dph60kcoPv90bMWjaGBiM=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/family-fun-56a239723df78cf772736c6f.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/aboutdotcomtravel", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/RCTKIMw-ogHb-i_rm4-GbKmaMQk=/385x0/filters:no_upscale()/about/White-House-Easter-56a236bf5f9b58b7d0c7f711.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/1if2aEpRLtZ26xItzN7O22tleQ0=/130x86/filters:no_upscale()/about/kids-family.bmp-56a239533df78cf772736b33.jpg", "http://fthmb.tqn.com/stCpuzs7mVILFS9xc5p2ltdUfqs=/640x0/filters:no_upscale()/about/White-House-Easter-56a236bf5f9b58b7d0c7f711.jpg"], "title": "White House Easter Egg Roll 2017: Tickets, Talent & More", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Google plans to introduce an ad-blocking setting in both the mobile and desktop versions of its Chrome browser, according to The Wall Street Journal . The option would be opt-in, and it would remove any and all \u201cunacceptable\u201d ads as defined by Coalition for Better Ads industry group . Those types of ads include pop-up ads, autoplay videos, and what are known as prestitial ads, or those ads that are often fullscreen and show up before you\u2019re taken to the homepage or desired website.\nGoogle wouldn\u2019t be blocking its own ads How Google will implement this feature is still being debated, the report says. One option includes blocking all advertising on a website if it includes even just one offending ad, which would ensure that website owners keep all forms of advertising up to standard. The other option is simply to block the offending ads in question, though it\u2019s unclear whether Google will go forth with either strategy. Google declined to comment for this story.\nIt may sound counterintuitive for a corporation whose entire business pretty much depends on internet advertising to consider an ad-blocking feature in the world\u2019s most popular web browser. However, Google has a vested interest in ensuring web users don\u2019t turn to third-party ad-blocking tools that don\u2019t differentiate between acceptable and unacceptable ads by industry standards and, in some cases, charge website owners money to bypass ad-blocking filters, effectively defeating the purpose of using ad-blocking plugins in the first place.\nThe company has a history of disallowing or preventing what it sees as harmful ad practices, like blocking pop-ups in new tabs and issuing malware warnings. So in a way, Google appears to be taking additional steps to clean up advertising bad practices and keep users happy, even if it means throwing a healthy chunk of the lower-end ad market under the bus.\nUpdate at 7:54PM ET, 4/19: Added that Google declined to comment.", "crawled": "2017-04-20T03:05:54.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-20T03:05:54.000+03:00", "uuid": "2f903f8cd9c1af5ce1abfacc71abc48ad4f0af9b", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 646, "likes": 646}, "gplus": {"shares": 6}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 8}}, "country": "US", "site": "theverge.com", "participants_count": 3, "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/theverge/tyzZ", "uuid": "2f903f8cd9c1af5ce1abfacc71abc48ad4f0af9b", "section_title": "The Verge -  All Posts", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 2, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 6, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.a0ERDGN194XDzDOfi07qD5c11elJmUiAl_KqGY.OoXVbTsRvWLrrz6TuJTMy6fad3U1wvfrp59FhWoYjddCl9CvZN4P3PwJqzB3HNBoIUCw--", "domain_rank": 496, "main_image": "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RmwVcz_hQt7bLx8Adt-lazqHSmE=/0x102:2040x1250/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54350663/Google_Chrome_Android_stock_2.0.0.jpg", "site_full": "www.theverge.com", "title_full": "Google reportedly planning built-in ad-blocking feature for Chrome - The Verge", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Google reportedly planning built-in ad-blocking feature for Chrome", "published": "2017-04-20T03:05:54.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "google"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "coalition for better ads"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "wall street journal"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.a0ERDGN194XDzDOfi07qD5c11elJmUiAl_KqGY.OoXVbTsRvWLrrz6TuJTMy6fad3U1wvfrp59FhWoYjddCl9CvZN4P3PwJqzB3HNBoIUCw--", "author": "theverge.com", "external_links": [], "title": "Google reportedly planning built-in ad-blocking feature for Chrome", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "\n\u2018I don\u2019t want to be touched, I don\u2019t like to be touched,\u2019 the boy cried. \n\nA school in Okeechobee, Florida is under fire after a video of a school resource officer arresting a 10-year-old boy with autism has gone viral. \nThe Washington Post reports that Luanne Haygood and her son John Benjamin had been called to Okeechobee Achievement Academy for standardized testing on April 12. When they arrived, officers arrested her son for an incident that happened in October, during which John Benjamin had kicked and scratched his educational assistant. The Haygood family weren\u2019t notified that John Benjamin had an outstanding warrant for battery involving a school employee. \nIn the video, taken by Luanne, John Benjamin sits slumped in a chair as Okeechobee County deputies reach for his hands, Luanne asking from behind the camera, \u201cDoes he have the same rights as an adult?\u201d \nJohn Benjamin then proceeds to tell the deputies, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be touched, I don\u2019t like to be touched,\u201d crying, as he puts his hands in the air in futility. \n\u201cIt\u2019s so fucking dumb, momma,\u201d John Benjamin says. \u201cIt\u2019s all their fucking fault!\u2026I didn\u2019t know I was going to go get arrested like this.\u201d One of the deputies cuffs his hands, then the other proceeds to escort the 10-year-old out of the school building and into a cop car. \nWhen Luanne asks to ride with her son to the police station, the officers tell her no. She asks for documentation, or an explanation for the arrest, and the officers decline. She explains that John Benjamin is autistic and scared, but the officers say he\u2019s going to be fine. According to the Post , Luanne\u2019s son spent the night locked up at a juvenile facility. \nJohn Benjamin\u2019s mother posted the video to Facebook , where it went viral. She\u2019s since taken it down. \nLuanne told the Post that John Benjamin had been diagnosed with autism two years ago and had an individual education plan, but was having issues with his assistant. He claimed she was hurting him, but the school wouldn\u2019t reassign him a new assistant. \nThen, on Oct. 27, John Benjamin kicked, scratched, and punched his assistant, after being told to go to timeout. The assistant had attempted to move him and had to restrain John Benjamin by wrapping his arms around the child\u2019s upper chest, according to documents. It\u2019s unknown why Luanne and the family weren\u2019t informed. \nProsecutor Ashley Albright is meeting with the educator who is pressing charges against John Benjamin, but said the State Attorney\u2019s Office will take his autism into consideration in deciding how to proceed with the case. \nAutism Society of America President Scott Badesh told the Post that the organization is in contact with the Haygood family to assist with services and legal counsel. The organization is also examining the incident to see if it can take the case to the Justice and Education Departments for investigation. \n\u201cIt appears the school\u2019s responses are beyond wrong and evil,\u201d Badesh said. \u201cIt is a tremendous failure by two allegedly responsible institutions\u2014the police and the school.\u201d \nAn Okeechobee County schools spokeswoman wouldn\u2019t disclose student information to the Post , but refuted that they would \u201cinvite someone to one of our campuses for the sole purpose to arrest.\u201d \nHaygood said that by sharing the jarring video of John Benjamin\u2019s arrest, she just wants her son \u201cto have the same education every other child is entitled to and receives.\u201d John Benjamin is due in court on May 11.

April 19 2017 6:16 PM Georgia\u2019s 6th Is a Democratic Win Even if Jon Ossoff ultimately loses. Democratic candidate Jon Ossoff speaks to his supporters in the special election for Georgia's 6th Congressional District, on Tuesday in Atlanta. Joe Raedle/Getty Images \nLast Tuesday, Democrat James Thompson came tantalizingly close to winning the special election for Kansas' 4 th Congressional District, previously held by Republican Mike Pompeo, who left the seat to serve as CIA Director in the Trump administration. Jamelle Bouie \nJamelle Bouie is Slate \u2019 s chief political correspondent. \nAt first glance, the race doesn\u2019t look especially competitive; Thompson won just 45.7 percent of the vote, to 52.5 percent for his opponent Ron Estes. But you have to consider the context: Pompeo won that same seat , five months earlier, with 60 percent support. His Democratic opponent won just 29.6 percent of the vote. Thompson, in other words, shrank a 31-point margin to just 7 points, a remarkable swing in a district that is 15 points more Republican than the nation at large, making it the 74 th most conservative district in the country . It\u2019s true that Democrats didn\u2019t win the seat\u2014fueling a round of possibly overwrought recriminations as activists and observers slammed the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for holding back support\u2014but it was still a victory, or at least a sign of good fortune for Democratic efforts to win the House of Representatives in 2018 or 2020. There are 59 Republican-held seats in districts that are less conservative than the one in Georgia. Advertisement \nThis past Tuesday saw a second special election, in Georgia\u2019s 6 th Congressional District, with Democrat Jon Ossofff facing off against a phalanx of Republican candidates in a so-called \u201cjungle primary,\u201d all vying to either win more than 50 percent outright, or go to a runoff election in June. Another solid red district , the Georgia 6 th gave Republican Tom Price\u2014now Trump\u2019s secretary of health and human services\u2014nearly 62 percent of the vote in November. On the presidential level, Mitt Romney won by a similar margin against Barack Obama in 2012. But Donald Trump barely squeaked out a win there, making the district a prime target for Democrats. Ossoff collected millions in donations and amassed an army of grassroots volunteers. But while he won the lion\u2019s share of votes , 48 percent to just under 20 percent for his nearest competitor, Republican Karen Handel, he didn\u2019t escape the runoff. He\u2019ll vie again for the seat in June against Handel, in a race where neither candidate has a clear advantage. \nOne way to read this is that Democrats have failed. (That is what Press Secretary Sean Spicer said explicitly on Wednesday.) That for all the base anger, there\u2019s not enough energy or organization to capture Republican districts and deal an actual electoral blow to Donald Trump. But this is shortsighted. Ossoff\u2019s performance represents a major swing from November. And this, in a previously safe Republican district, with just four months to mobilize and build a campaign. It might not be success, but it\u2019s indicative of shifting political ground. Get Slate in your inbox. \nThe next special election, for Montana\u2019s at-large congressional seat, is in similarly red territory; the district is 11 points more Republican than the nation at large. And the one after that is for a district, South Carolina\u2019s 5 th , that is 9 points more Republican than average . In either race, a swing of the sort we\u2019ve seen in Georgia and Kansas would be significant, even if Democrats lose. Movement with that consistency would suggest a worsening national atmosphere for Republicans, one in which Democrats could potentially take the 24 seats they need to win the House next year. According to the Cook Report , there are 59 Republican-held seats in districts that are less conservative than the one in Georgia. Both Kansas and Georgia, in other words, are good national omens for Democrats. \nThey also have an immediate, present effect. Now is the time when lawmakers are making choices about their careers\u2014where they decide if re-election is in their futures, or if they will retire. The kind of atmosphere where Democrats are competitive in solid and deep-red districts is one where vulnerable or wary Republicans think twice about filing for another election. It\u2019s not hard to imagine a scenario where, following tight contests in Montana and South Carolina, Republican lawmakers start announcing retirements. Already, Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz\u2014following vocal criticism from constituents and constant ridicule for his conduct as House Oversight chair\u2014 announced on Wednesday his plan to \u201creturn to the private sector\u201d at the end of his term. Would-be incumbents clearing out strong Republican seats also would have the potential to make races in those districts more competitive going forward. If nothing else, beyond retirement, Republican lawmakers will think twice about backing the Trump administration if doing so yields a real challenge for their seat.

Join In \nOn the other side, recruits are always easy to find when the field is in your favor, and Democrats may find themselves, for the first time in years, with strong candidates to run in as many districts as possible. \nYes, there are larger factors at work. If, between now and next year, Donald Trump becomes popular, the situation changes. Likewise, if the economy experiences an unprecedented boom, the situation changes. But if we assume more of the same\u2014an energized Democratic base and a flailing administration, mired in controversy\u2014then Democrats enter the 2018 election season on favorable terrain. The question, then, is if Democrats can utilize that advantage, not just to flip the House, but to rebuild the party itself, and make it a regular presence in those places where it\u2019s been absent. The time for a long-term strategy is now, and it remains to be seen if Democrats are up for the challenge.

Photo illustration by Slate . Photo by Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images. \nBill O\u2019Reilly and the Fox News Channel have negotiated an exit deal for the highest rated host in cable news. Thanks in part to vigorous reporting on numerous sexual-harassment allegations against him, a number of advertisers pulled spots from The O\u2019Reilly Factor ,which has now aired its final episode. As the most-watched host on the most successful cable channel of the past two decades, O\u2019Reilly came to represent a style of in-your face conservatism that had previously been associated primarily with talk radio. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s uniquely aggressive personality and instinctual skills in front of the camera go a long way toward explaining his success. But he also tapped into the right-wing id in a way no one had before, captivating his viewers with his unbridled egotism and stoking their resentments. It was a playbook that won him a huge audience\u2014and, to judge by Donald Trump\u2019s eerily similar appeal to voters, a legacy that will outlast his grip on the 8 p.m. time slot. Isaac Chotiner \nIsaac Chotiner is a Slate staff writer. \nWhen The O\u2019Reilly Report began in 1996\u2014the show didn\u2019t become what O\u2019Reilly referred to as \u201cThe Factor\u201d until 1998\u2014it was your typical anti-Clinton offering from Fox News, with many of the same preoccupations of other conservative programs in the second half of that decade. (White House scandals, mainly.) Over his first several years on the air, O\u2019Reilly made an effort to appear reasonable. He declared that he was not a Republican, but an independent; he refused to support the death penalty; he talked about the value of environmental protection; he said that he understood both sides of the debate on issues such as gun control and the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict; and he took immense pride\u2014which manifested itself as smug self-satisfaction\u2014in his supposedly nonpartisan, down-home common sense. This posture may have been dishonest\u2014O\u2019Reilly was a registered Republican who was happy to demagogue issues like gay rights when it suited him. But the gap between O\u2019Reilly and robotic partisans such as Sean Hannity was noticeable, and the posture fit with the \u201cfair and balanced\u201d ethos that Fox News was then making an effort to pretend to uphold. Advertisement \nO\u2019Reilly\u2019s minor heresies during his first decade on the air were ultimately less indicative of the future direction of his show than the passions that always consumed him. These were not the same passions of the Club for Growth crowd. O\u2019Reilly was naturally in favor of tax cuts and smaller government, and after 9/11 he became predictably jingoistic, offering full-throated support for the Iraq war and a tough line on terrorism. But even then it was clear that the traditional Republican platform never really motivated him. The idea of O\u2019Reilly spending more than 30 seconds talking about supply-side economics was unfathomable; Limbaugh and Hannity would do so constantly. Instead, what motivated O\u2019Reilly were two kinds of resentment. If we\u2019d paid closer attention to O\u2019Reilly\u2019s success, Trump\u2019s rise would perhaps have been a bit less of a shock. \nThe first was typical of the cultural conservatism of our age, and generally consisted of free-floating anger at any figure or institution that didn\u2019t uphold what O\u2019Reilly called \u201ctraditional values.\u201d A college professor would call America a fascist country, or a retailer would announce that it would greet customers with \u201chappy holidays\u201d rather than \u201cMerry Christmas.\u201d O\u2019Reilly would rant and rave; he would call for people to be fired; he would bemoan that America was becoming less religious and less white. (One of his many silly books was called Culture Warrior ; the latest is Old School .) Sure, Limbaugh and Hannity would occasionally focus on culture instead of politics, but for O\u2019Reilly, it was what fueled the show, and what really got him exercised. (Much was made of his Levittown upbringing and disdain for snobby elites.) Even better, he didn\u2019t appear to be faking it in the way one often suspects of certain right-wing hosts. All of the details that have leaked out about O\u2019Reilly\u2014from the harassment claims to the violent way he behaved toward his ex-wife\u2014strongly suggest that he was not playing a character when he fumed on the air. Get Slate in your inbox. \nBut the aspect of The O\u2019Reilly Factor that always shocked me was a different kind of resentment, which took the form of the anchor\u2019s unrepentant solipsism. It\u2019s simply impossible to overstate how much of each night\u2019s show was consumed by O\u2019Reilly\u2019s own grievances. He skirmished with everyone from Matt Lauer to Rosie O\u2019Donnell to Al Franken, and those fights would invariably become the topic of the day on his show. He spent countless hours talking about himself \u2014usually as the victim of various conspiracies. (Frequently, George Soros was the conspiracy\u2019s prime mover.) He would drone on about the New York Times and how it was out to make him look bad. It was endless, and it was exceptionally boring\u2014to everyone except his legions of viewers and fans. \nI never really had a theory for how this supposed man of the people got away with talking about nothing but himself. Then Donald Trump came along. Here was another rich guy who built a following speaking up for the working man. Like O\u2019Reilly he seemed entirely driven by resentment: at President Obama, at the media, at the people who doubted him. And like O\u2019Reilly, he spoke almost entirely of himself. His stump speeches were shocking, in part, because they were rarely about anything other than Donald Trump. When I would see him talk to a bunch of working-class voters in the Midwest and appeal to them by describing his own battles with CNN, I was surprised. But not as surprised as I would have been if I hadn\u2019t been watching O\u2019Reilly all these years. Advertisement \nI have no idea if Trump\u2014a compulsive Fox News watcher\u2014consciously modeled aspects of his personality (or at least the ones that are conscious constructions) on O\u2019Reilly. (They were friendly with each other well before Trump began his run for the presidency.) But if we had been paying closer attention to just how O\u2019Reilly managed to succeed, Trump\u2019s rise would perhaps have been a bit less of a shock. Neither man\u2019s appeal was primarily about something like \u201ceconomic insecurity\u201d; it was about group identity, and the cultural resentments that each man expertly cultivated. When your viewers (or voters) feel the same resentments, and come to view you as one of them, anything and everything becomes forgivable, and your trials and tribulations, however foreign, somehow become relatable. \nWhatever Trump took from O\u2019Reilly, it seems clear that the Donald\u2019s unlikely political rise emboldened the Factor . In recent months, O\u2019Reilly has become a conspicuously more Trumpist figure. The racism and misogyny have been dialed up; the hard edge on issues like immigration, on which he had once tried to equivocate, have been emphasized; and his partisanship is now so obvious as to be a punchline. Top Comment \nIt's the modern American conservatism: publicly claiming to define and enforce traditional values and morality, while stuffing your pockets with money and treating women like sex toys. These guys are just crooked televangelists, using politics instead of religion. More... Join In \nIn 2016 and 2017, as both O\u2019Reilly and Trump battled accusations of misconduct, it\u2019s been hard not to see them as twinned: bigoted, sexist dinosaurs from the past. Each man went to extreme lengths to defend the other, and you sensed that this wasn\u2019t only because they share the same audience but also because they have so much in common, that they really do see themselves in one another. \nWhich is why it was initially so exhilarating to hear that the O\u2019Reilly era has ended, at least on Fox: Finally we are seeing the downfall of a true symbol of reaction and misogyny. But satisfaction these days has a tendency to give way to despair. An even larger symbol (and transmitter) of these ugly ideas is sitting in the White House. O\u2019Reilly\u2019s time has finally come, but the forces he helped unleash on American culture remain ascendant.

One single instrument playing a familiar tune would have the audience immediately recognize which song they were about to sing. The piano joined in as the spotlight hit just one man standing in the middle of them all. The first three words were sung, and at this moment the entire audience knew that this was not going to be just another version of arguably Josh Groban's most famous song of all time. With the dynamics of 12 men, the power of their performance was limitless.\nThis vocal group called 12 Tenors delighted the audience with their harmonies. Chills ran down the spines of those sitting to enjoy this song, but while it continued, they were all waiting for that one moment. Several of the men took turns for a solo with the background singers doing a phenomenal job. It started out with that slow tempo, allowing the song to increase in its glory. Each of their voices were just as flawless as the others, but soon enough, they would all join in at once and blow them all away.\nTheir voices boomed from the stage straight out to the audience in an unforgettable way.

He imagined having a solid family and savings.\nBut in Dayton, Ohio, he had a job literally doing the city's dirty work: cleaning up after the garbage trucks dumped their load at the county incinerator.\nHe had been a fast-living teenage drug dealer, making about $500 or $600 a day.

I have too much to live for.\"\nSo he quit the drug scene, but when the money stopped coming in, he had no money to support his three children with his ex-girlfriend Afrika Groves. Groves turned to welfare, and the government went looking for Mallory for failing to make child support payments.

Brown/Getty Images; Marvel \nThe search is over: Captain Marvel , starring Brie Larson as the superhuman Carol Danvers, has scored not one, but two directors with Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck. \nMany names were rumored for the job since Larson was formally announced for the title role at San Diego Comic-Con in 2016. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige had also spoke about the importance of utilizing a female director for the film, which marks the first time a woman will headline her own solo superhero movie in the franchise. \nFeige had hoped to make an announcement by the end of 2016. While Marvel has yet to make an official statement on Boden and Fleck\u2019s involvement, EW has learned the duo will jointly helm the project. \nMuch like filmmakers Joe and Anthony Russo (the Captain America movies, Avengers: Infinity War ), James Gunn ( Guardians of the Galaxy ), Ryan Coogler ( Black Panther ), and Jon Watts ( Spider-Man: Homecoming ), Boden and Fleck were picked to helm a Marvel movie after directing smaller-scale films. The pair were behind the camera on episodes of Billions and The Affair , as well as films like Mississippi Grind and It\u2019s Kind of a Funny Story . \nLarson, who won an Oscar for her role in Room , will portray Carol Danvers. Rising to the rank of Major in the Air Force, Carol worked alongside the alien Captain Mar-vell. Only after her DNA was spliced together with that of the Kree did she emerge with superhuman strength, flight, and concussive force blasts. \n\u201cWith Captain Marvel, she is as powerful a character as we\u2019ve ever put in a movie,\u201d Feige said . \u201cHer powers are off the charts, and when she\u2019s introduced, she will be by far the strongest character we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d \nCaptain Marvel screenwriter Nicole Perlman also noted , \u201cI think that making sure that Captain Marvel is not somebody who is a hero in spite of her femininity is really important.

At one point during the \u201ctroll storm\u201d campaign, she said she came home to a dark house, her husband waiting inside with the bags packed. \u201cWe really thought we had to run for safety in the middle of the night,\u201d Gersh said. \nSince the first post on December 16, according to the lawsuit, he has published 30 posts calling for actions against Gersh. \u201cThis was really terrorism,\u201d Gersh said Tuesday. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get teased, we got terrorized.\u201d \nAccording to court records, Anglin has not responded yet to the lawsuit. One of Gersh\u2019s attorneys, Richard Cohen, the legal director at the Southern Poverty Law Center, told BuzzFeed News on Wednesday that they haven\u2019t served Anglin with the suit yet. Anglin is a resident of Ohio, but reportedly could be residing in the Philippines or somewhere in Europe. \nWhen he does respond, legal experts expect Anglin will raise some sort of First Amendment defense. However, in order to win in court, he will have to prove to a jury that the speech he engaged in was not intended to cause harm. \n\u201cSpeech that a reasonable person would construe as harm, that\u2019s not protected. In our system, you can hold discriminatory views, you can\u2019t act on them,\u201d David Schulz, a partner at Levine, Sullivan, Koch, Schulz, who has 35 years of First Amendment litigation experience. \n\u201cIf [Anglin] can say, I\u2019m just expressing an opinion and try to pull this into the sphere of free speech, it gets back to what a reasonable person would understand as protected speech\u201d Schulz says. \nTo prove that he was just expressing his opinion, Anglin might argue that he was merely republishing Sherry Spencer\u2019s Medium blog post in which she accuses Gersh of attempting to extort her as part of a real estate deal to sell off a piece of property in Whitefish, Montana. \nIn November 2016, according to the lawsuit, Gersh reached out to Sherry Spencer about a planned protest outside a building that Spencer owns in downtown Whitefish. Gersh claims that she informed Sherry Spencer about the demonstrations, which were being planned in response to a viral video of her son, Richard, leading a \u201cHail Trump!\u201d chant, and offered to help Spencer sell the building. According to the lawsuit, Gersh and Sherry Spencer began to discuss working together to sell the property. But then a month later, Sherry Spencer apparently had a change of heart, and published the Medium post accusing Gersh of extortion. \nMontana Law School Professor Eduardo Capulong points out that if Anglin could prove that he was merely commenting on this purported feud between the Spencers and Gersh, he would be protected. \u201cBut using it as basis to attack without verifying is reckless,\u201d he added. \n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing, if Anglin said: Oh, look at this blog post, and fuck them. That\u2019s arguably protected by free speech,\u201d Capulong said. \u201cBut then, you go beyond that and say: target this family.\u201d \nAsked if Anglin\u2019s calls for his readers not to be violent would protect him, Capulong said, \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Given everything that he was doing, and invoking Nazi ideology, images, I think any reasonable person would see that as a call to violence.\u201d ", "crawled": "2017-04-19T23:28:46.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-19T23:28:46.000+03:00", "uuid": "ce868d2706e5ae6ad0c70935e034c4d2cd6f63a6", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 24, "shares": 943, "likes": 943}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 4}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}}, "country": "US", "site": "buzzfeed.com", "participants_count": 0, "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/buzzfeed/UteY", "uuid": "ce868d2706e5ae6ad0c70935e034c4d2cd6f63a6", "section_title": "BuzzFeed - Latest", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 9, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRULI3Cl7YN6x1S4FCvs99G4tGI0cOrjr.c3jxvQthHUthdGPlmZB7uiFUXpvquN0neAbj6vH.QVw9g8Mg5OSW77Xv.XiUjWtVpLgdXjLBGzTIFZk49ua_3", "domain_rank": 137, "main_image": "http://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-04/19/15/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-01/original-1495-1492629370-5.jpg?crop=800:430;0,0", "site_full": "www.buzzfeed.com", "title_full": "The First Amendment Gave This Neo-Nazi The Right To Be Vile \u2014 But Then He Went Too Far", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "The First Amendment Gave This Neo-Nazi The Right To Be Vile \u2014 But Then He Went Too Far", "published": "2017-04-19T23:28:46.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "montana"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "levine"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "philippines"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "europe"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "sherry spencer"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ohio"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "whitefish"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "eduardo capulong"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "richard cohen"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "tanya"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "andrew anglin"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "koch"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "spencer"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "schulz"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "gersh"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "david schulz"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "capulong"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "sullivan"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "tanya gersh"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "richard"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "sherry spencer"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "richard spencer"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "anglin"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "christ"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "montana law school"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "buzzfeed news"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "spencers"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "sherry spencer"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "southern poverty law center"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRULI3Cl7YN6x1S4FCvs99G4tGI0cOrjr.c3jxvQthHUthdGPlmZB7uiFUXpvquN0neAbj6vH.QVw9g8Mg5OSW77Xv.XiUjWtVpLgdXjLBGzTIFZk49ua_3", "author": "", "external_links": [], "title": "The First Amendment Gave This Neo-Nazi The Right To Be Vile \u2014 But Then He Went Too Far", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Home Bollywood Salman Khan And Nephew Ahil Are Picture Perfect Together Salman Khan, who is currently busy with his DaBangg world tour, took out time to bond with his little nephew Ahil in Hong Kong.

According to a statement from the network, O'Reilly's departure is \"effective immediately.\" \n\"After a thorough and careful review of the allegations, the Company and Bill O'Reilly have agreed that Bill O'Reilly will not be returning to the Fox News Channel,\" parent company 21st Century Fox said in a statement. \nBeginning Monday, the day O'Reilly was scheduled to return from a two-week vacation , Tucker Carlson will take over O'Reilly's 8 p.m. timeslot.

It appears that that will not happen. (Dana Perino and Greg Gutfield will host The Factor for the remainder of this week.) \nThe O'Reilly Factor host became increasingly toxic after the New York Times reported that O'Reilly and/or Fox News have paid at least five women to not pursue legal action or speak publicly about their sexual harassment allegations against him. The payouts have totaled about $13 million. \nThe company previously stood by O'Reilly through public scandal before, even renewing his contract earlier this month. But now, in the wake of advertisers jumping ship and public opinion turning against O'Reilly (even among The O'Reilly Factor' s viewers, according to a survey by Morning Consult ), Fox News is putting the political commentator, who has been with the network since its inception in 1996, out to pasture. \nO'Reilly released a statement on Wednesday afternoon, saying it is \"tremendously disheartening\" to leave the network under the current circumstances. \n\"Over the past 20 years at Fox News, I have been extremely proud to launch and lead one of the most successful news programs in history, which has consistently informed and entertained millions of Americans and significantly contributed into building Fox into the dominant news network in television,\" O'Reilly said. \"It is tremendously disheartening that we part ways due to completely unfounded claims. But it is the unfortunate reality that many in the public eye must live with today. I will always look back on my time at Fox with great pride in the unprecedented success we achieved and with my deepest gratitude to all my dedicated viewers. I wish only the best for Fox News Channel.\" \nO'Reilly's axing continues a streak of misfortune for cable's top-rated news network, which lost its founder and CEO Roger Ailes last summer in a similar sexual harassment scandal and saw the departure of Megyn Kelly earlier this year. \nEditors note: The story was changed to reflect O'Reilly's statement to the media.", "crawled": "2017-04-19T23:13:49.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-19T23:13:49.000+03:00", "uuid": "f3517a6c658a648a5ecc4aa68e6610dd980155d0", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 10, "shares": 922, "likes": 922}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "tvguide.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://rss.tvguide.com/breakingnews", "uuid": "f3517a6c658a648a5ecc4aa68e6610dd980155d0", "section_title": "TVGuide.com: Breaking News", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 9, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_1A.Vb4CoXZgJtKqPLe3q5tOEpnxlZtqvwanMsPxMUxzBmUD6lowKXJx0ueroULqewegQSCYtEIA--", "domain_rank": 1238, "main_image": "http://cimg.tvgcdn.net/i/r/2017/04/19/5c20fd40-1d3b-4ebd-b0b5-87a8c5f37d66/thumbnail/1300x867/782ae71648c57583310d060fc4588aef/billoreilly-news.jpg", "site_full": "www.tvguide.com", "title_full": "Bill O'Reilly Fired From Fox News", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Bill O'Reilly Fired From Fox News", "published": "2017-04-19T23:13:49.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "bill o'reilly"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "megyn kelly"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "alec baldwin"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dana perino"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "greg gutfield"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "o'reilly"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "roger ailes"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "carlson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "tucker carlson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "fox"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "fox news share"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "google"}, {"sentiment": "neutral", "name": "whatsapp  fox news"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "21st century fox"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "fox news channel"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "new york magazine"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "new york times"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "fox news"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_1A.Vb4CoXZgJtKqPLe3q5tOEpnxlZtqvwanMsPxMUxzBmUD6lowKXJx0ueroULqewegQSCYtEIA--", "author": "Liam Mathews", "external_links": [], "title": "Bill O'Reilly Fired From Fox News", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Home Bollywood Parineeti Chopra Says Priyanka Chopra Texted Her 'First' After Meri Pyaari Bindu Song \"When Priyanka Chopra came back from the US at the age of 16 she was totally American as she had an accent,\" said Parineeti Written by: Nilanjana Basu | April 19, 2017 22:34 IST ( New Delhi ) 768 Shares \"She used to teach us English songs,\" said Parineeti \"She was cool and amazing,\" she added Priyanka and Parineeti are cousins Actress Parineeti Chopra made her singing debut in her upcoming film Meri Pyaari Bindu and has been widely appreciated by her fans and celebrity colleagues.

The children are crossing 'county lines', hence the name. \nThe virtue of using children in this way is that children are less likely to arouse the suspicion of the police. Even if caught, they will get less punishment. Hannah has been in a three year fight to pull her son - Thomas - out of the lure of a drug gang Credit: ITV News \nThe Home Office document obtained by ITV News showed the government now believes the problem to affect nearly all police forces in the country. \nThe groomed children are often targeted for being vulnerable or at risk - perhaps they attend a pupil referral unit or live in a children's home. \nAfter being plied with gifts - such as new trainers and clothes - they are asked to run drugs in return. \nToday ITV News speaks to one mother about the agony and frustration of watching your child descend into this world. \nHannah - who is not using her real name to protect her family's identities - describes how little you can do about the grooming and how the authorities appear almost powerless to help. \nHannah has been in a three year fight to pull her son Thomas - also not his real name - out of the lure of a drug gang. She describes a \"race against time\" before he gets to the fast-approaching age where he will be imprisoned. \nToday Hannah tells how Thomas was a gifted student at one of the country's top grammar schools in the Home Counties. \nThree years ago, he went missing for eight days and then began an extended ordeal for his family. \nThomas was eventually found in the company of adult gang members whom the police said were known to be extremely violent. \nHe was found by the police he was in the company of an adult male. \nWhat's he doing with these men that we don't know? \nIt is a horrible feeling of somebody outside of your house having more control over your son than you do as a parent. \u2013 Hannah \nThe police said they believed Thomas had been \"groomed\". Two child abduction orders have been served and when referred to the National Referral Mechanism, the government's scheme for identifying victims of human trafficking, Thomas\u2019s case came back with positive grounds for trafficking within the UK. \nDespite evidence that Thomas had been exploited and in need of protection, the authorities have so far failed to extricate him from this world and in the more than two years since then, even though he lives in his family home, his mother tells us he has descended deeper into this world. 120 Times Thomas's mother Hannah has reported her son missing. \nSince last summer, Hannah has reported her son missing 120 times. \nShe describes frequently lying awake at night until 4am, waiting for his return. She has found mobile phones in his possession and the police have confirmed to her that he is involved in selling drugs. Hannah describes lying awake at night until 4am waiting for his return Credit: ITV News \nHannah said: \"Because I know my son and I saw the change, it is clear that he has been influenced to do what he is doing. \n\"There is no doubt in my mind he has been groomed.\" \nThomas previously wanted to be a lawyer, but his mother has now given up hope of him even taking his GCSEs this summer. \nHer best hope, she now says, is for him to be criminalised and sent to prison because at least it will bring out in to the open who has drawn him into this criminal world. \nHannah said: \"To get the evidence you are at out looking at getting your son criminalised. Because there is nowhere else to go. \n\"It is highly unlikely he is going to pass any of his exams. So it has literally gone from quite a rosy future for him, to doing everything I possibly can to make sure that he stays alive. \n\"He has witnessed things I will never see in my entire life.\" Credit: ITV News \nThe government is concerned about the issue of \"county lines\" and after ITV News' report last year produced a change to legislation to crack down on the mobile phones which dealers use to sell drugs. \nBut many involved think it will not address the problem. \nThe problem involves drug dealers preying on young people. To gather evidence this has happened, the children would need to testify against the older gang members, often powerful people in their neighbourhood. \nHannah said: \"They [police] are not able to move things on unless there is evidence of coercion, but it could be verbal coercion that the police aren't going to see...If you recognise that he has been groomed, then you have to recognise that testimony isn't going to come?\" \nShe added: \"There is something wrong if children or minors are treated the same by the police or other agencies as those who have groomed them. There is no distinction then between the adult and the child. \n\"It's groomers we need to be targeting to stop this.\" Play video \nSome like the Labour MP Ann Coffey are calling for a so-called Fagin order where anyone suspected of attempting to groom a minor would be slapped with an order, before the grooming progressed further. \nThe virtue of this would be to prevent the child being sucked into the gang world. Once the child gets drawn into drug dealing, it is very hard for the police to prove that a child was forced to run drugs. \nSome of these children do indeed start as victims of coercion but come to embrace their new life. Others may plan to get out but then find it is too late. \nOther critics would like a new law of Child Criminal Exploitation to mirror that introduced recently to deal with Child Sexual Exploitation. \nThis would be targeted at the adult gang leaders and could see them convicted of \"child exploitation\", something its advocates say could shame the drug dealers into stopping the practice. \nIndeed, Cressida Dick, the new Metropolitan Police Commissioner, linked the two issues together in recent comments. Play video \nThe government is reluctant to introduce much new legislation, but equally it wants to tackle this issue. As more and more parents speak out, the government may eventually have to reach out for a stronger response. \nSarah Newton, Minister for Vulnerability, Safeguarding and Countering Extremism, said that they were taking active steps alongside police to tackle criminal exploitation on children in a statement. \nGang-related violence, drug dealing and exploitation have a devastating impact on young people, their families and local communities. And they have no place in a Britain that works for everyone. \nWe have taken action with a range of measures to tackle child criminal exploitation including introducing legislation to allow police to shut down the phone lines used to market drugs and working with law enforcement, local authorities and the voluntary sector to provide advice and expertise to help shape their response. \nOur work is sending a very clear message that we will not tolerate this criminal activity. \u2013 Sarah Newton, Minister for Vulnerability, Safeguarding and Countering Extremism", "crawled": "2017-04-19T23:09:49.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-19T23:09:49.000+03:00", "uuid": "b6eff05a76328a88d60b39762d7566e03ea1dfc1", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 808, "likes": 808}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "itv.com", "participants_count": 0, "site_section": "http://www.itv.com/news/index.rss", "uuid": "b6eff05a76328a88d60b39762d7566e03ea1dfc1", "section_title": "National Updates", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 8, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9ibLms25NnVImzYjE9lMy4Z_CXUzN9Vqxxw0yyyFqSxBRBhds0qZAnA16gTyiIFvdYhW6pavgZJRm4YzLfHgqDYZvf314AJooRbkbWElNYxD5vPATlpIbk4lw2.ligFVSUK7MlDuS3IN.8bNtz65vIwrkfX8X81HQ-", "domain_rank": 2701, "main_image": "http://news-assets.sn.itv.com/image/file/1269928/img.jpg", "site_full": "www.itv.com", "title_full": "Mother describes agony of watching her child being groomed by drug dealers", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Mother describes agony of watching her child being groomed by drug dealers", "published": "2017-04-19T23:09:49.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "uk"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "britain"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "thomas"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "hannah"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ann coffey"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "\u2013 hannah"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cressida dick"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "sarah newton"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "itv news"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "fagin"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "home office"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "labour"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "itv news  the home office"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9ibLms25NnVImzYjE9lMy4Z_CXUzN9Vqxxw0yyyFqSxBRBhds0qZAnA16gTyiIFvdYhW6pavgZJRm4YzLfHgqDYZvf314AJooRbkbWElNYxD5vPATlpIbk4lw2.ligFVSUK7MlDuS3IN.8bNtz65vIwrkfX8X81HQ-", "author": "", "external_links": [], "title": "Mother describes agony of watching her child being groomed by drug dealers", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Plan Your Perfect Meal And We'll Tell You What Wine To Drink You got: Pinot Noir \nVersatile Pinot Noir goes with just about any food, but it's also light enough to be drank on its own.

Bill O\u2019Reilly has officially been forced out at Fox News after numerous sexual harassment allegations surfaced in recent weeks, Fox\u2019s parent company 21st Century Fox confirmed on Wednesday, April 19 . Find out more in the video above, and detailed below. \n\u201cAfter a thorough and careful review of the allegations, the Company and Bill O\u2019Reilly have agreed that Bill O\u2019Reilly will not be returning to the Fox News Channel,\u201d 21st Century Fox said in a statement. \nEarlier in the day, New York Magazine reported that O\u2019Reilly, 67, would be let go from his decades-long position as an anchor at Fox News prior to his return from an Italian vacation on April 24. According to sources, network executives were most concerned about how to make O\u2019Reilly\u2019s transition out as seamless as possible. Political commentator, Bill O'Reilly, during an interview on July 13, 2016. Lloyd Bishop/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images \nO\u2019Reilly has been a commentator on the cable news channel for just over two decades, and arguably has one of the most loyal viewerships of any personality on cable television. ( NYMag reports that O\u2019Reilly\u2019s ratings actually saw an uptick amid the growing number of sexual harassment allegations in recent weeks.) Biggest Celebrity Cheating Scandals Ever! \nApproximately two and a half weeks ago, the New York Times revealed that O\u2019Reilly and Fox News had quietly reached settlements with five women who had filed complaints against him over the years, with the monetary compensation totaling somewhere close to $13 million. \nMost recently, one woman claimed that O\u2019Reilly once called her \u201chot chocolate\u201d and would make inappropriate comments and grunts at her in the workplace. \nIn the days following the Times \u2019 initial report, more than 50 advertisers pulled their ads from O\u2019Reilly\u2019s show, and women\u2019s rights groups called for the news anchor to be fired. Donald Trump's Most Outrageous Quotes Ranked \nFor his part, O\u2019Reilly vehemently denied any wrongdoing, with his lawyer claiming that the host \u201chas been subjected to a brutal campaign of character assassination that is unprecedented in post-McCarthyist America.\u201d President Donald Trump added fuel to the fire by saying in an interview with the Times that O\u2019Reilly is \u201ca good person.\u201d \n\u201cI think he shouldn\u2019t have settled; personally, I think he shouldn\u2019t have settled,\u201d Trump, 70, said in the controversial Times interview. \u201cBecause you should have taken it all the way.

WeWork is currently in the research phase of a new initiative through which it will revamp companies\u2019 offices for them, remaking them in WeWork\u2019s image and arming them with office-management technology and a cultural attach\u00e9.\nadvertisement Chief product officer David Fano and head of product research Joshua Emig unveiled the infant project at a breakfast event today inside a glossy wood-walled WeWork in lower Manhattan. They discussed how they\u2019re planning to move WeWork beyond co-working spaces to help big companies manage their own offices. Initially these on-site services will only be for large companies with 50,000 to 60,000 square feet and at least 1,000 employees. The new offerings would include everything from building out interiors to managing guests, booking conference rooms, coordinating events, analyzing office data on space usage, and providing a human community manager to instill WeWork philosophies.\nWeWork has already been quietly offering the services to some companies. It gave no specifics today about when it will ramp up the project.\nLondon\u2019s WeWork South Bank Lounge [Photo: courtesy of WeWork]. Fano pitches the concept as \u201cspace-as-a-service,\u201d though that\u2019s not an official term. What it means is that WeWork will charge a recurring fee for its property and culture management services. The emphasis here is on helping other businesses attain WeWork\u2019s worker-focused mentality by providing an attractive workspace that is both efficient and provides certain perks\u2014like coffee and snacks. \u201cWe\u2019re never going to be a design- and-build firm,\u201d says Fano.\nHe says WeWork is only willing to architect and construct offices because it has design principles that play into how it manages office spaces. Additionally, he\u2019s not looking to make money on overhauling other people\u2019s workplaces. Rather, he and Emig see it as a way to give customers the cost savings that WeWork enjoys, because of its vendor relationships. The build-out also serves to entice businesses into its cultural management subscription as well as other possible uses for WeWork. As an example, Fano described how it whittled one Chicago business from three floors of office space down to two floors, while retaining the same number of employees. WeWork made up some of the square footage loss by giving the company desks inside of its own co-working network.\nThe announcement of on-site services comes as WeWork is trying to attract bigger businesses. In addition to offering services inside of buildings leased by others, WeWork is also looking to offer medium to large businesses more expansive offices on its own premises, including multi-floor rentals. It currently has five buildings, which are leased by only one or two companies.\nPricing for the new services are still being developed, though it seems like the company may have to take a very tailored approach to this sort of arrangement. Clients will be expected to foot the bill for renovations and then pay a yearly fee to license WeWork\u2019s software and community manager. In order to get WeWork to redesign an office space, businesses will have to commit to a three- to five-year service contract.\nExpanding WeWork in this way allows it to get beyond some of the hurdles it may normally face in growing the footprint of its co-working storefronts. It currently boasts 135 locations and caters to roughly 20,000 businesses, but landlords are not always keen to sign companies like WeWork because of its financial model. \u201cCoworking facilitators are viewed as profiting from the lease arbitrage between negotiated lease rent and the price point charged to users, thus any turn in market dynamics could upset profitability,\u201d noted a CBRE Research report from June.\nadvertisement But by exporting its methodology, WeWork just might open up another avenue for amplifying its reach.", "crawled": "2017-04-19T22:57:42.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-19T22:57:42.000+03:00", "uuid": "34f4f536b47889d55de9e65700cdc5be532804af", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 794, "likes": 794}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 418}}, "country": "US", "site": "fastcompany.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/fastcocreate/feed", "uuid": "1e2347344b6c9697fa248f720bbb13ad3266396b", "section_title": "Fast Company", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 7, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRKZ_NGDEdmEJ2Bvtz231XO5BBM.QH466cAJfek8FJ7GJoFbj3X7qOakPEnyQWhn7hTGjNepo4lriJD_p6.Wzau39QSM__Ta0J7J8DfLTpVWJBMlL_zny43EDclecWiNTLwQBADfMmITkKk2n5Rvu7f693mikVn4gEd4FemYbfcvI.m6H72oQPli2jWck_noV_MclTG4aBQ4GBs6U5lfoWZ28L3fCkjrhzUzULNCGUj9MmstYQ4TXzfmqVFMQtji8IQ7uS7x_yfag--", "domain_rank": 3157, "main_image": "https://assets.fastcompany.com/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto,q_60,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2017/04/p-1-WeWork-Wants-To-Build-Out-Your-Office.jpg", "site_full": "www.fastcompany.com", "title_full": "Now WeWork Wants To Build Out Your Office And Run It For You", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Now WeWork Wants To Build Out Your Office And Run It For You", "published": "2017-04-19T22:57:42.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "chicago"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "london"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "manhattan"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "wework"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "emig"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "david fano"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "fano"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "joshua emig"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "wework"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cbre research"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "wework south bank lounge"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRKZ_NGDEdmEJ2Bvtz231XO5BBM.QH466cAJfek8FJ7GJoFbj3X7qOakPEnyQWhn7hTGjNepo4lriJD_p6.Wzau39QSM__Ta0J7J8DfLTpVWJBMlL_zny43tcbg5O_PdXE-", "author": "Ruth Reader", "external_links": [], "title": "Now WeWork Wants To Build Out Your Office And Run It For You", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "NBCSN NASCAR America NASCAR Tue 5:30pm ET NBCSN NASCAR America NASCAR Wed 5:30pm ET NBCSN Wild vs. Blues Game 4 Hockey Wed 9:30pm ET USA Ducks vs. Flames Game 4 Hockey Wed 10pm ET NBCSN PFT Live NFL 7am ET NBCSN The Dan Patrick Show 4-20 General 9am ET NBCSN ISU World Team Trophy Figure Skating: Tokyo 4-20 Figure Skating 12pm ET NBCSN World Para Ice Hockey Championships Finals General 2:30pm ET Golf Channel Valero Texas Open - Rd 1 Golf 3:30pm ET NBCSN NASCAR America NASCAR 5:30pm ET USA Rangers vs. Canadiens Game 5 Hockey 7pm ET NBCSN Blackhawks vs. Predators Game 4 Hockey 7pm ET NBCSN Sharks vs. Oilers Game 5 Hockey 10:30pm ET Golf Channel United Leasing & Finance Championship - Rd 2 Golf Fri 8am ET NBCSN The Dan Patrick Show 4-21 General Fri 9am ET NBCSN ISU World Team Trophy Figure Skating: Tokyo 4-21 Figure Skating Fri 12pm ET Golf Channel Bass Pro Shops Legends of Golf at Big Cedar Lodge - Rd 1 Golf Fri 12pm ET NBCSN Rugby Sevens World Series: Singapore General Fri 2:30pm ET Golf Channel Valero Texas Open - Rd 2 Golf Fri 3:30pm ET NBCSN Maple Leafs vs. Capitals Game 5 Hockey Fri 6pm ET USA Bruins vs. Senators Game 5 Hockey Fri 7:30pm ET NBCSN Flames vs. Ducks Game 5 Hockey Fri 10pm ET NBCSN Man City v.

of the Royal Family Jenny Erikson \nFortunata/Splash News The palace is making her feel right at home! Apparently, the guards at Kensington Palace have been instructed to treat Meghan Markle \"like everyone else who lives there.\" Most visitors undergo a thorough security check, but it seems like Meg is practically part of the family already. \nDozens of royals call the palace home, including Prince William and Kate Middleton, and of course Meghan's beau, Prince Harry. As such, the ginger royal has asked the guards to make sure she's \"waved right through,\" according to Us Weekly . \nMore from CafeMom: If Meghan Markle Marries Prince Harry She'll Get a Whopper of a Royal Title \nSeems like a pretty big step -- almost like they're already living together. Which may be the case anyway, since she's based in Toronto to film Suits , and he calls London home. Just last week he was caught sneaking into her home in Canada in the dark of night . \nApparently, the 35-year-old beauty already has direct access to palace aides, who have been helping her in her royal transformation.

WeWork is currently in the research phase of a new initiative through which it will revamp companies\u2019 offices for them, remaking them in WeWork\u2019s image and arming them with office-management technology and a cultural attach\u00e9.\nadvertisement Chief product officer David Fano and head of product research Joshua Emig unveiled the infant project at a breakfast event today inside a glossy wood-walled WeWork in lower Manhattan. They discussed how they\u2019re planning to move WeWork beyond co-working spaces to help big companies manage their own offices. Initially these on-site services will only be for large companies with 50,000 to 60,000 square feet and at least 1,000 employees. The new offerings would include everything from building out interiors to managing guests, booking conference rooms, coordinating events, analyzing office data on space usage, and providing a human community manager to instill WeWork philosophies.\nWeWork has already been quietly offering the services to some companies. It gave no specifics today about when it will ramp up the project.\nLondon\u2019s WeWork South Bank Lounge [Photo: courtesy of WeWork]. Fano pitches the concept as \u201cspace-as-a-service,\u201d though that\u2019s not an official term. What it means is that WeWork will charge a recurring fee for its property and culture management services. The emphasis here is on helping other businesses attain WeWork\u2019s worker-focused mentality by providing an attractive workspace that is both efficient and provides certain perks\u2014like coffee and snacks. \u201cWe\u2019re never going to be a design- and-build firm,\u201d says Fano.\nHe says WeWork is only willing to architect and construct offices because it has design principles that play into how it manages office spaces. Additionally, he\u2019s not looking to make money on overhauling other people\u2019s workplaces. Rather, he and Emig see it as a way to give customers the cost savings that WeWork enjoys, because of its vendor relationships. The build-out also serves to entice businesses into its cultural management subscription as well as other possible uses for WeWork. As an example, Fano described how it whittled one Chicago business from three floors of office space down to two floors, while retaining the same number of employees. WeWork made up some of the square footage loss by giving the company desks inside of its own co-working network.\nThe announcement of on-site services comes as WeWork is trying to attract bigger businesses. In addition to offering services inside of buildings leased by others, WeWork is also looking to offer medium to large businesses more expansive offices on its own premises, including multi-floor rentals. It currently has five buildings, which are leased by only one or two companies.\nPricing for the new services are still being developed, though it seems like the company may have to take a very tailored approach to this sort of arrangement. Clients will be expected to foot the bill for renovations and then pay a yearly fee to license WeWork\u2019s software and community manager. In order to get WeWork to redesign an office space, businesses will have to commit to a three- to five-year service contract.\nExpanding WeWork in this way allows it to get beyond some of the hurdles it may normally face in growing the footprint of its co-working storefronts. It currently boasts 135 locations and caters to roughly 20,000 businesses, but landlords are not always keen to sign companies like WeWork because of its financial model. \u201cCoworking facilitators are viewed as profiting from the lease arbitrage between negotiated lease rent and the price point charged to users, thus any turn in market dynamics could upset profitability,\u201d noted a CBRE Research report from June.\nadvertisement But by exporting its methodology, WeWork just might open up another avenue for amplifying its reach.", "crawled": "2017-04-19T22:47:08.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-19T22:47:08.000+03:00", "uuid": "b06bf812a72185b7dc5298770e023d15230f2bd6", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 794, "likes": 794}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 418}}, "country": "US", "site": "fastcompany.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.fastcompany.com/", "uuid": "b06bf812a72185b7dc5298770e023d15230f2bd6", "section_title": "Fast Company", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 7, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8x4N6wd0tCr8kbffXKBruas37gjavZ0XZ7UTKj0iK7UnQTWVjJlLsrbC1gb2MsYcZchSjHjUAIH3gNpnigAYtLJS.UWxMV1TCLxi9xjhVVd12vNEsWb02jcHnmeTuMa_M-", "domain_rank": 3157, "main_image": "https://assets.fastcompany.com/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto,q_60,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2017/04/p-1-WeWork-Wants-To-Build-Out-Your-Office.jpg", "site_full": "www.fastcompany.com", "title_full": "Now WeWork Wants To Build Out Your Office And Run It For You", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Now WeWork Wants To Build Out Your Office And Run It For You", "published": "2017-04-19T22:47:08.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "chicago"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "london"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "manhattan"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "wework"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "emig"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "david fano"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "fano"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "joshua emig"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "wework"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cbre research"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "wework south bank lounge"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8x4N6wd0tCr8kbffXKBruas37gjavZ0XZ7UTKj0iK7UnQTWVjJlLsrbC1gb2MsYcZchSjHjUAIH3gNpnigAYtLJS.UWxMV1TCLxi9xjhVVd12vNEsWb02jcHnmeTuMa_M-", "author": "Ruth Reader", "external_links": ["http://www.cbre.us/research/2016-U-S-Reports/Pages/US-Shared-Workplaces-Part-3.aspx"], "title": "Now WeWork Wants To Build Out Your Office And Run It For You", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "share It\u2019s totally possible to play Diablo 2 as a pacifist, even if it\u2019s not easy to do so. Speedrun enthusiast DrCliche decided to take his pacifist playthrough to another level by playing the game as fast as possible without attacking a single enemy. The whole playthrough archive, streamed live first on Twitch , is on YouTube in its full seven-plus-hour glory. It takes DrCliche seven hours, 41 minutes exactly to finish Diablo 2 \u2019s Lord of Destruction expansion on normal difficulty, with the added challenge of never intentionally killing a soul. There\u2019s a catch, of course, as DrCliche explains in a detailed guide to the pacifist run. He equipped his character with thorn-covered armor, so that any time an enemy hit him, his gear would just hit them right back. Based on DrCliche\u2019s defined set of rules, that didn\u2019t count as a kill; as long as he never took any intentional aggressive actions, he was in the clear. There\u2019s one enemy that nearly threw the whole run into peril. One of the big bads in the game\u2019s fourth act is Lord De Seis, who\u2019s both unskippable and only has ranged or elemental attacks, alongside some major healing powers. That made for some difficult pacifistic play. \u201cBut De Seis's elemental attacks do proc Chilling Armor, and at level 30, with Cold Mastery, 6 points in Chilling Armor, and a +2 staff, you do damage quickly and consistently enough to keep Lord de Seis from ever casting Bestow,\u201d DrCliche explained. Sounds anxiety-inducing, if you ask us. Start watching the full run above to judge for yourself, or check out DrCliche\u2019s guide on Reddit to figure out how to recreate your own pacifistic speedrun through Diablo 2 .

The crown jewel of the issue is cover star Julia Roberts, People's Most Beautiful Woman of 2017 . Unfortunately, People Magazine got it wrong: The most beautiful woman in the world is me. \nI have no way of knowing the process by which People chooses its Most Beautiful Woman every year, or how they parcel out specific beautiful celebrities from other beautiful celebrities, or why they overlooked me completely. In a letter at the beginning of the issue, People Editor-in-Chief Jess Cagle writes, \"When it came time to choose a cover for the 2017 World\u2019s Most Beautiful Issue, it seemed that the time was right for Julia Roberts. At 49, Julia has never looked better. But her beauty also lies in her self-assurance and smarts and good humor.\" \nI have no problem with that statement, but I will say this: If never looking better and having self-assurance, smarts, and good humor are the qualities by which one is selected, I don't know why it couldn't be me (or someone like me) on that cover. Our favorite pretty woman #JuliaRoberts is PEOPLE's World's #MostBeautiful Woman \u2014 for the record fifth time! https://t.co/LuHlCkaONA pic.twitter.com/x9vr2kjR2Z \u2014 People Magazine (@people) April 19, 2017 \nWhat I do know, though, is that while Julia Roberts, a five-time World's Most Beautiful cover honoree, is beautiful, she's beautiful by a set of very explicit standards \u2014 standards that many women find impossible to meet or (gasp) don't want to meet. Roberts is gorgeous, yes, but she's also thin, white, cisgender, and able-bodied. Perhaps you find that beautiful \u2014 I do too \u2014 but beauty comes in infinite forms. How can we say Roberts is the most beautiful when everyone's standards of beauty are completely, totally, and blessedly different? And if that's the case, doesn't that mean that in certain contexts, I'm the most beautiful as well? \nHere's the thing: Lack of representation doesn't mean you never get to see something that diverts from the norm. People has given the honor to four women of color in the past (Halle Berry in 2003, Jennifer Lopez in 2011, Beyonc\u00e9 in 2012, and Lupita Nyong'o in 2014). \nHowever, they are all thin, cis, and able-bodied, and still represent a total of fewer covers than Roberts was awarded herself. It makes sense, too. People is a magazine about celebrities, and celebrities are what make up Hollywood. According to a research study performed by the Media, Diversity and Social Change Initiative at USC's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, only 28.3 percent of speaking roles in movies went to people of color in 2016 \u2014 subtract from that the men of color, and women of color are left with even less opportunity. When it comes to people with disabilities (who are virtually nonexistent in Hollywood ) and trans folks, the numbers are even more grim \u2014 and magazines about Hollywood inevitably follow suit. \nBy approaching a mass audience with this kind of content, mainstream media is staking the claim that out of all the representations of beauty in this world, thin, white (and every so often, brown), cis women are at the highest level of conventional beauty accomplishment. Making your way to that level means adhering to these rigid and aspirational standards \u2014 and if you're not, you're not the most. \nBut what if we reimagined what the phrase \"most beautiful\" actually means? What if it meant that by whatever standards you use to frame beauty, you're at the top? What if it meant that you could be the most beautiful, whether you're fat, brown, disabled, trans, or otherwise \u2014 because those qualities are the most appreciated, the most valued, the most deserving? What if we acknowledged that beauty is a construct and therefore should be considered with the utmost subjectivity, leaving all of us to define ourselves as the most beautiful, by whichever terms feel right to us? \nSo with that, I'll unapologetically grab that title: I'm fat, I'm tall, I'm over 30, my pores are pretty big, and my nose is pretty Polish. My teeth are kind of yellow from all the coffee I drink, and my nails are ripped to shreds. Like Julia, I'm self-assured, smart, and have good humor \u2014 but I'm also bossy, intense, and selfish. Like Julia, my appearance affords me a lot of privilege \u2014 and that privilege means I have an easier time asserting myself as beautiful than others do, a fact that I'd like to change. I want to see more Most Beautifuls: black women, trans women, women with disabilities, fat women, women over 60. When the \"Most Beautiful\" means the most of whatever beauty standards you set for yourself, you're automatically at the top. I look nothing like this year's honoree (or any year's honoree for that matter), by my terms, I'm the most goddamn beautiful woman in the world . \nAnd guess what? You are, too.

I woke up this morning a mere mortal myself, but after trying the long-rumored, ridiculously anticipated beverage for the first time this morning, I may have taken a glimpse into infinity. I can confirm officially that the Unicorn Frapp? One hundred percent worth the hype. \nThe drink, which is as delicious as it is fleeting \u2014 seriously, guys, it's only available from Thursday, April 19 to Sunday, April 23, so gallop on over fast \u2014 was given a helpful but still rather loose flavor profile from the Starbucks team. The drink has a cr\u00e8me frappuccino base with mango syrup, as well as an artful drizzle mix of what Starbucks calls \"sour blue drizzle\". It's then topped with whipped cream and pink and blue \"unicorn dust,\" making it the object of your dizziest Instagram daydreams. \nThe real sweet sauce here, though? The fact that the drink is both flavor- and color-changing. The purple base shifts to pink the longer you drink it, and the flavor, which is initially more sweet, turns tart by the end \u2014 as mysterious and magical as an actual unicorn. Kathryn Kattalia/Bustle \nBut what does it actually taste like IRL? Well, friends, the first flavor you experience will not be a taste, but the unstoppable compulsion to make the nearest sentient human with a camera take a picture of you being basic as hell. \nOnce that's over and you actually taste it, the ~magic~ begins. The base definitely has notes of mango in it, but not in an overwhelming way; if I hadn't known that was the flavor beforehand, I might not have guessed it right off. It's definitely sweet \u2014 the people with sweet teeth in the office didn't mind so much (aka, me), but some others might want to speed along the process of making the drink tart by mixing the sour blue drizzle in faster than it would on its own. (Word to the wise: if you aim your straw at the blue drizzle and suck in that alone, it will COME FOR YOU like a pack of Sour Patch Kids in the night. If you're into sour flavors, it will be your jam .) \nThe flavor change is subtle, but definitely welcome \u2014 you don't get the same drink fatigue you might if you're bored of a flavor halfway through. Word to the wise, though: DO NOT MAKE A ROOKIE MISTAKE AND HOLD THE WHIPPED CREAM. Look me in the eye and promise me you won't. It is essential not just for the 'gram, but for the perfect and fragile flavor balance of this drank. Tanya Ghahremani/Bustle \nThe Starbucks Unicorn Frappuccino retails in Tall between $4.25 to $4.95, depending on the market, and will be available at participating Starbucks stores in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico from April 19 to April 23. Godspeed, my fellow unicorn nerds; may your taste buds and your Instagrams be #blessed during this magical time.

The prominent jurist's body was found floating in the Hudson River, but indeterminate signs of a struggle have compounded However, the authorities made a rhetorical change to the case \u2014 Judge Sheila Adbus-Salaam's death is now classified as \"suspicious\" by the NYPD. \nThe New York Post first reported the new twist in the case Tuesday, citing both named and anonymous sources from inside the NYPD. The new classification reflects the ambiguity of the case , which shows some hallmarks of a self-inflicted death and some of a homicide. The police are also reaching out to the public for help in solving the case, since there's no video evidence of where Abdus-Salaam went after leaving her house on her last day or how she ended up in the river. \nNYPD spokesman Stephen Davis told the Post : We're looking at it as a suspicious death at this point. ... We haven't found any clear indications of criminality, but at this point we can't say for sure. We're hoping if anyone could shed any light into the hours before her disappearance, it would help us establish what happened. The #NYPD is seeking info on the death of Judge Sheila Abdus-Salaam. Anyone with info is asked to call our detectives at the numbers listed. pic.twitter.com/pSXDtuaVTo \u2014 NYPD 26th Precinct (@NYPD26Pct) April 18, 2017 \nInvestigators in the case initially suspected that suicide was the cause of Abdus-Salaam's death , for several reasons. According to Al Jezeera , both Abdus-Salaam's mother and brother had died in recent years around the Easter holiday , and her brother had committed suicide. Abdus-Salaam also had left her house with nothing but a MetroCard, which police said could indicate suicidal intent (though she may have just been out for a morning run). \nYet the autopsy report showed at least one sign of a struggle , some bruising around Abdus-Salaam's neck. Her lungs also had water in them, indicating that she was still breathing when she went into the river. However, according to the Office of the Medical Examiner, her eyes did not show the petechial hemorrhaging, bleeding in the whites of her eyes, consistent with strangulation. Absent further evidence, it's nearly impossible to create a conclusive narrative of Abdus-Salaam's death right now.

One anonymous source told the Post that the uncertainty is what prompted the status change in the case, because it's so unclear as to how Adbus-Salaam died. \n\"God forbid someone a year from now says, 'I killed the judge and this is how I did it,'\" and police don't have the evidence to support or refute that claim, the source told the Post . \"That's why they're sending out these notices. It's to cover their bases. \" \nWhatever the NYPD's motive, the renewed push for information from the public may achieve the goal of providing badly needed answers in the case.

Posted on Share \nBuzzFeed Health spoke with three experts \u2014 Dr. Filamer Kabigting , assistant professor of dermatology at Columbia University Medical Center, Dr. Rachel Miest , Minnesota-based dermatologist with Mayo Clinic, and Dr. Evan Rieder , assistant professor of Dermatology at NYU Langone Medical Center \u2014 to learn more about pubic hair and best practices for grooming, whether you like your pubes au natural, nonexistent, or somewhere in between. \nHere are all the interesting things they had to say. 1. Pubic hair acts as a cushion for your genitals and reduces friction when you're having sex. \n\"Pubic hair acts like a defensive barrier between you and the things you come into contact with,\" Rieder says. \"It also protects against friction, preventing abrasions and injury of the surrounding skin.\" 2. And it can potentially help protect you from bacterial infections and viruses during skin-to-skin contact. Share \n\"Its presence does prevent foreign particles, such as bacteria, from not only infecting the skin, but also from entering the body,\" Miest says. \"So pubic hair does potentially serve as a protective mechanism for STIs, and hair removal does put us at a higher risk for those infections, like herpes, HPV, and gonorrhea.\" That's not to say that going bare is going to cause an STI, but if your grooming method leaves you with abrasions or tears in the skin, it's possible an infection can enter the body this way. \nShe adds that skin, in general, harbors bacteria and viruses, and pubic hair can help prevent them from spreading to others during sexual contact. 3. It's called pubic hair because of where it grows: in the lower part of the abdomen just above the genitals, aka the pubis region. Share \n\"Anatomically that region is called the pubis, which is why it\u2019s called pubic hair,\" Kabigting says. 4. Pubic hair transplants are a real thing in some places where having more pubic hair is seen as a sign of fertility and attractiveness. Share \n\"Dermatologists and plastic surgeons are performing pubic hair transplants in the US too, but not in great quantity,\" Rieder says. \"South Koreans see pubic hair as attractive, and they're usually on the forefront of cosmetic dermatology, coming up with innovations years before new products and techniques reach America.\" 5. And yes, pubic wigs (aka merkins) are a thing . Share \n\"They are definitely a niche interest, but they do exist,\" Rieder says. \"Before the advent of penicillin (the gold standard for the treatment of syphilis), prostitutes would wear merkins to cover up the appearance of sexually transmitted infections. They've also reportedly been used on stage for actors who were playing roles of the opposite sex.\" 6. It's a myth that when you shave, your pubic hair will grow in thicker. Share \n\"When a new hair comes in, it's actually tapered at the end like a javelin, making the hair look like it's thinner,\" Rieder says. \"And when you shave, you cut off that tapered end, getting a jagged, blunt tip that makes it look like the hair is growing in thicker.\" \nKabigting says the only way to actually make a pubic hair grow in thinner is by getting laser hair removal treatment. 7. At a certain length (usually relatively short but it's different for everyone) your pubic hair will stop growing. Share \n\"Every hair that we have has three specific stages during its life cycle: growth, rest, and ultimately shedding , which can be different lengths of time for every individual and every area of their body,\" Miest explains. \"And in most cases your pubic hair is like your eyelash hairs in that it will grow to a short length and then fall out on its own.\" \nThe length your hair will grow to is determined by genetics (think about how some people just have longer eyelashes than others), so you don\u2019t need to worry about having to throw it in a ponytail or braid it if you decide to go au natural. 8. Your pubic hair can be a completely different color than the hair on the rest of your body. Share \n\"Melanin is a protein that gives hair its color and it's found in different quantities in different areas of the body,\" Rieder says. \"For many people, there is little variation, but for others, the color of the scalp, underarm, and pubic hair is not always the same.\" 9. Evolutionarily speaking, pubic hair starting to come in signals that puberty and sexual maturation are on their way. Share \n\"Pubic hair begins growing in when people start to mature and go through puberty,\" Rieder says. \"It's a sign that someone is able to start procreating, which makes sense since pubic hair's supposed main purpose is to protect the genitals during sex.\" 10. Pubes can thin out with age, and some people go completely bald in their genital region. Share \nSome thinning of the body hair is common with age, but Rieder says that for women, pubic balding or thinning can sometimes be due to hormonal imbalances associated with menopause. \nThere are also several medications and medical conditions that can cause pubic hair loss in childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood, he says. If you're experiencing pubic hair loss, definitely let your doctor know. 11. According to all three experts, grooming habits are culturally-specific, and within the past few decades people in the US have been grooming their pubes more frequently than in the past. Share \n\"Grooming habits are very cultural and are in some ways influenced by fashion trends and the media,\" Kabigting says. \"There has been a big shift towards grooming pubic hair here, and the clients I see say it's because of a range of reasons from swimwear trends, to what's seen in movies and TV shows, to what's being done in the pornography industry.\" \nHe also says some people just like the way shaved genitals look and feel and that it sometimes has nothing to do with outside influence. 12. A 2016 study showed that most women who groomed their pubic hair did so for \"hygienic purposes\" but actually, it's more hygienic to have pubes. Share \n\"People believe that it\u2019s more hygienic to shave their pubic hair, so they make it a habit, especially if there\u2019s a chance they'll be having sex or oral sex, because they want to be 'clean' for their partner,\" Kabigting says. \"It's not the hair, but the genitals and the folds of the skin on the genitals that can be a good breeding ground for bacteria.\" \nHe says that as long as you're showering and practicing good hygiene, your pubic hair isn't going to be a hellish petri dish of infectious bacteria. 13. Also, people in the US who are younger or have sex regularly seem more likely to be concerned with grooming their pubes. Share \nIn one study , the majority of men who reported grooming said they did so as preparation for sex, and in another study the most common motivation for women who groomed their pubic hair was hygiene. In both studies, younger respondents were more likely to groom. \n\"In my experience with clients, people stop shaving when they get older because shaving is tedious and they just don\u2019t care about maintaining it as much anymore,\" Kabigting says. 14. Grooming your pubes can cause irritation because it's basically microscopically wounding your skin. Share \nMiest says waxing or plucking your pubic hair is going to cause microscopic damage because you're forcibly removing the hair from its follicle. And shaving can cause the same thing if you're using a blade that isn't sharp enough and isn't sterile (which, let's be honest, most of ones we're using probably aren't) and if you're usually shaving against the grain to get as much of the hair as possible. \nSo, if you are going to get rid of your pubes, do the best you can to minimize the stuff that causes irritation. Here are some ways to make your next Brazilian wax less terrible, for example. And if you're getting it done professionally, make sure you're going to someone who can meet whatever specific needs you might have around the sensitivity of your skin, the products you like, etc. \nMiest recommends that right after you shave, wax, or remove your pubes, you keep the area clean and dry and use a topical steroid cream to reduce inflammation. Don't scrub the area, and consider taking a break from working out because the added friction can cause irritation. 15. Having small abrasions and a super irritated crotch post hair-removal makes you more susceptible to inflammation and bacterial infection.", "crawled": "2017-04-19T22:24:13.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-19T22:24:13.000+03:00", "uuid": "4811ab4e8abfc33bfcbcc1f08e50be210ac3b8b7", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 47, "shares": 899, "likes": 899}, "gplus": {"shares": 4}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 4}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "buzzfeed.com", "participants_count": 0, "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/buzzfeed/UteY", "uuid": "4811ab4e8abfc33bfcbcc1f08e50be210ac3b8b7", "section_title": "BuzzFeed - Latest", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 8, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRULI3Cl7YN6x1S4FCvs99GKqHCPpGZzqK_P7Ee.4Oquvc6C_9wNii.HQ_foatFT0kKl5iNz_Y8.Q--", "domain_rank": 137, "main_image": "http://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-04/14/13/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/original-31527-1492190495-4.jpg?crop=1200:628;0,0", "site_full": "www.buzzfeed.com", "title_full": "23 Things You Should Know About Pubic Hair", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "23 Things You Should Know About Pubic Hair", "published": "2017-04-19T22:24:13.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRULI3Cl7YN6x1S4FCvs99GKqHCPpGZzqK_P7Ee.4Oquvc6C_9wNii.HQ_foatFT0kKl5iNz_Y8.Q--", "author": "", "external_links": [], "title": "23 Things You Should Know About Pubic Hair", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "When it comes to Instagram beauty trends, everyone loves a spectacle.

It's weird, but people love it. Drew Barrymore was an early fan, posting a selfie of herself in the Hanacure All-In-One-Facial last February, writing, \"when you take it off you are 10 years younger,\" and, \"it makes you look so fresh when you wash it off.\"\n #beautyjunkieweek this is a @hanacureeffect mask @thehanacure nuts when you take it off you are 10 years younger. You paint it on with a brush. It starts to dry. It pulls. It gets so tight that it literally pulls your face. See above. But, It makes you look so fresh when you wash it off. And it's so effective.

The brand claims its mask can tackles all the big skin-care concerns \u2014 reducing pores, hyperpigmentation, and wrinkles \u2014 in one month (used once a week). It's powered by botanical ingredients including lotus leaf extract, oriental raising tree extract, green tea extract, honeysuckle flower extract, rosa canina fruit oil, peony root extract, sophora root extract, and peptides. It comes in two parts, a serum and a sealed solution you mix to form a gel you paint on your face with a brush, then leave on for 30 minutes.\nWe are currently sold out of the Starter and the set.

Over the half hour, my face started feeling petrified \u2014 I couldn't even smile or otherwise move any facial muscles because of how tight the mask was getting. Around the 14-minute mark I started questioning whether I'd be able to stand it for the full half hour. My face was warm and I could feel it pulsing beneath the mask. I was getting fidgety from not being able to move. I also looked 100 years old thanks to the wrinkle-like cracks and sunken effect of the mask (see the second photo below).\n ", "crawled": "2017-04-19T22:23:48.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-19T11:42:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "63528284bebaf3863d34844843097f31db529294", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 746, "likes": 746}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "cosmopolitan.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/news/", "uuid": "63528284bebaf3863d34844843097f31db529294", "section_title": "Beauty Tips, Celebrity Style, and 2017 Fashion Trends - Cosmopolitan", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 7, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8yl0AHkVCZS2F6aohdMk2MJny2CnABKH4sf1W0XuqreaXDrWgvJ7LppuFLh0up1R4PTPlhaGY5hgbnkbJR47oX", "domain_rank": 1970, "main_image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/gallery-1492458880-facemask-1492613455.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.670xh;0,0.0457xh&amp;resize=1200:*", "site_full": "www.cosmopolitan.com", "title_full": "Hanacure All-In-One Facial Review - Skin Tightening Mask", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Hanacure All-In-One Facial Review - Skin Tightening Mask", "published": "2017-04-19T11:42:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "south ko"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "drew barrymore"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "barrymore"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "positive", "name": "hanacure all-in-one facial review"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8yl0AHkVCZS2F6aohdMk2MJny2CnABKH4sf1W0XuqreaXDrWgvJ7LppuFLh0up1R4PTPlhaGY5hgbnkbJR47oX", "author": "Cosmopolitan.com", "external_links": ["https://www.hanacure.com/pages/science", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/17/16/1024x512/landscape-1492457987-facemask2.jpg?resize=980:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/17/16/1024x512/landscape-1492457987-facemask2.jpg?resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/17/16/1024x512/landscape-1492457987-facemask2.jpg?resize=768:*", "https://www.instagram.com/hanacureeffect/", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/17/16/1024x512/landscape-1492457987-facemask2.jpg?resize=640:*", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BQoahk5Fv0K/", "https://www.instagram.com/p/BSywcNMluBI/"], "title": "Hanacure All-In-One Facial Review - Skin Tightening Mask", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Carly Patterson is graduating from the balance beam to the baby belly!\nThe 2004 Summer Olympics champ and her husband Mark Caldwell are expecting their first child together, she shared this week.\n\u201cThose closest to us know we have struggled to get pregnant for quite some time and were wondering if this would ever happen for us,\u201d Patterson, 29, captioned an Instagram photo collage of the couple posing on the beach. \u201cThankfully, God has answered our prayers and Baby Caldwell is due October 2017!\u201d\n\u201cMark and I could not be more overjoyed for our little miracle and we cannot wait to start this journey of parenthood!\u201d Patterson continued. \u201d \u2018For this child I have prayed and the Lord has granted the desires of my heart\u2019 1 Samuel 1:27.\u201d\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

Brown/Getty Images; Marvel \nThe search is over: Captain Marvel , starring Brie Larson as the superhuman Carol Danvers, has scored not one, but two directors with Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck. \nMany names were rumored for the job since Larson was formally announced for the title role at San Diego Comic-Con in 2016. Marvel Studios President Kevin Feige had also spoke about the importance of utilizing a female director for the film, which marks the first time a woman will headline her own solo superhero movie in the franchise. \nFeige had hoped to make an announcement by the end of 2016. While Marvel has yet to make an official statement on Boden and Fleck\u2019s involvement, EW has learned the duo will jointly helm the project. \nMuch like filmmakers Joe and Anthony Russo (the Captain America movies, Avengers: Infinity War ), James Gunn ( Guardians of the Galaxy ), Ryan Coogler ( Black Panther ), and Jon Watts ( Spider-Man: Homecoming ), Boden and Fleck were picked to helm a Marvel movie after directing smaller-scale films. The pair were behind the camera on episodes of Billions and The Affair , as well as films like Mississippi Grind and It\u2019s Kind of a Funny Story . \nLarson, who won an Oscar for her role in Room , will portray Carol Danvers. Rising to the rank of Major in the Air Force, Carol worked alongside the alien Captain Mar-vell. Only after her DNA was spliced together with that of the Kree did she emerge with superhuman strength, flight, and concussive force blasts. \n\u201cWith Captain Marvel, she is as powerful a character as we\u2019ve ever put in a movie,\u201d Feige said . \u201cHer powers are off the charts, and when she\u2019s introduced, she will be by far the strongest character we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d \nCaptain Marvel screenwriter Nicole Perlman also noted , \u201cI think that making sure that Captain Marvel is not somebody who is a hero in spite of her femininity is really important. She\u2019s a very strong character and her being a woman is part of that strength.\u201d \nThe film is scheduled for release on March 8, 2019. \nVariety was the first to report the news of Boden and Fleck.
