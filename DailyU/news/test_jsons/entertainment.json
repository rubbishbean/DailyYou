She what she does RIGHT after leaving the gym below! \nKhloe Kardashian, 32, spilled her post-gym secrets on her app and website on April 18. \n\u201cHow you recover from your workout is just as important as the workout itself,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYour body needs to adapt to the physical stress of exercise by repairing muscle and replenishing energy stores in order to maximize all the amazing benefits of a tough sweat sesh. You\u2019ve already put in the hard work, so make sure you\u2019re reaping #yourbestbody rewards by using these simple recovery techniques!\u201d Khloe Kardashian\u2019s Weight Loss Transformation \u2014 SEE PICS \n1. TAKE A BATH \n\u201cIntense exercise depletes the body of magnesium, leading to muscle cramps, joint pain and inflammation, all of which can cause you to call it quits when the pain gets too real. Replenish your magnesium supply by pouring two cups of Epsom salts (naturally composed of magnesium sulphate) into a warm bath and soak for 15 to 30 minutes. I store my salts in decorative jars and display them for a pretty bathroom accent.\u201d \nI like Dr Teal\u2019s salts \u2014 it\u2019s super affordable and they smell amazing. \n2. ROLL OUT \n\u201cGive your muscles some post-workout deep-tissue love using a foam roller, massage therapy ball or a muscle roller stick. \u201cRolling\u201d puts targeted pressure on your muscles and connective tissue, releasing trigger points where you feel tight and sore. This helps release the toxic build up of lactic acid that accumulates in your muscles after an intense workout, helping to prevent injury, increase flexibility and speed up the recovery process. Hurts SO good!\u201d \n3. EAT SOMETHING \n\u201cThe first 45 minutes after exercise is your \u201canabolic window,\u201d which is the period of time that food is converted to build lean muscle. I always make sure I have a meal within that time frame, and smoothies are usually my go-to . Try combining these three key ingredients for a simple smoothie that refuels your body and repairs your muscles. Bananas are an excellent source of carbs and potassium, both of which are depleted post-workout; Protein World\u2019s Whey Protein replenishes amino acids that are known to be fast-acting and easily digested; almond butter provides unsaturated fat for an energy pick-me-up and salt to restore electrolytes. A pack of almond butter on it\u2019s own is better than nothing, so I ALWAYS keep them handy!\u201d \nShe likes Justin\u2019s Almond Butter packets. Read her smoothie recipe here ! \nHollywoodLifers , what do you do after working out?

The 46-year-old actress, who is a cancer survivor, told news agency PTI that she will be revisiting her own struggles while portraying the role of Mr Dutt's mother in the biopic. \"Whenever I see a cancer patient today it is like reliving the moment. I am affected in any which ways. When I will be performing that (Nargis Dutt's role). I am yet to start shoot, of course I will be revisiting that,\" PTI quoted Manisha Koirala as saying. Nargis Dutt died in 1981 due to pancreatic cancer, just days before Sanjay Dutt made his debut in Hindi films. Manisha Koirala is 'excited' to be portraying the role of Nargis in the Dutt biopic . The Bombay actress told PTI: \"It is a great opportunity and honour to be playing Nargis Dutt ji on-screen. She is a legendary figure. I hope I do justice to the chance that is given to me. We did couple of look test and I think we have got closer to the look both in short or long hair. I am excited and kicked about it.\" The film, which is being produced by Vidhu Vinod Chopra, features Ranbir Kapoor in lead role.

If that comes my way I will do it.\" In 2012, Manisha Koirala was diagnosed with ovarian cancer . The Mann actress won the battle with the disease in 2015 after which she has been actively involved in spreading awareness about cancer. \"After that lot of things changed. I understood the importance of health and life and I connected with my soul. I think a person does become weak mentally and emotionally with any disease. But even in that time also one should be strong. I believe in the divine, we all have the strength and courage within us we just have to look for it,\" PTI quoted Manisha Koirala as saying.

Lol at the ambo asking Spencer, \u201cWho\u2019s your mom?\u201d I mean, she couldn\u2019t answer that coherently even in perfect health. \n3. \u201cMaybe they thought we knew too much about something.\u201d Oh Emily, literally no one is worried about you knowing too much about anything. \n4. Also there is no way that anyone can know too much about anything . These storylines are all such a mess, everyone\u2019s related to everyone, and people keep dying and disappearing. Does I. Marlene even know where this is going? \n5. Wait, why did Mary Drake run away? I can\u2019t even remember why she was at the blind school in the first place. Hmmm. \n6. OF COURSE everyone survived and is 100% fine except Yvonne the random background character with no relevance. Placing bets on the fact they'll kill her off so Spencer and Toby reunite. \n7. Ah good. Another post-sex scene to remind us once again, that these girls are adults. \n8. All of these girls are suspiciously very OK considering they just witnessed a shooting and a beheading. \n9. I guess they\u2019re used to it by now. \n10. Lmao imagine being Ali. How do you say to your doctor, \u201chello can I please get a DNA test for my baby. I know who the father is but I\u2019m not 100% sure if I\u2019m the mother \u201d Freeform Share \n11. Ezra doesn\u2019t have a great track record with his partners getting abducted, hey? \n12. Will they ever address WHY Nicole was kidnapped? And also why we should even really care at all? \n13. I\u2019m so happy they\u2019re literally talking about \"endgame\" in the show. It\u2019s like they\u2019re saying \u201cstick with us guys, it\u2019s really nearly over, see we\u2019re even EXPLICITLY saying it, don\u2019t give up now\u201d. \n14. Wow A.D. has really gone hi-tech on the \u201cpresents\u201d. \n15. Aria\u2019s doll even has little pink streaks in its hair\u2026 maybe A.D. is Jason after all. \n16. THANK GOD Mona is here I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll sort everything out. \n17. But wait can she funnel her energy into doing something productive to find A.D., instead of focusing on Hanna\u2019s unnecessary career? \n18. S the cops know that Rollins was really Archer Dunhill? But they think he\u2019s still alive? \n19. TWO GUNS? Goddamn how do all these people get their hands on these guns? Oh right\u2026 they live in America. \n20. But does that mean Mary was shooting at them too? Share \n21. Who the fuck is Holden? Why are they introducing new characters? Don\u2019t we have enough loose ends to tie up? (Where is Lorenzo? Where is Lucas? Where is Jason?) \n22. OK, apparently we\u2019ve seen him before but clearly he had no significance because I have no clue at all who he is supposed to be. \n23. MONA IS PERFECT IN THIS EPISODE, AS USUAL. \n24. I\u2019m so happy to see Mona and Hanna working together again I just wish it was about something mysterious, not a fucking dress. \n25. Oh thank god, Olivia Benson is back to save the day. \n26. But also why did it take her a WHOLE WEEK to come back after HER DAUGHTER WAS SHOT? SHOT. WITH A GUN. \n27. OMG Spencer thanks for coming through with a recap that was better than the one at the beginning of the episode. \n28. \u201cYou want a glass of wine?\u201d YAS BRING THAT WINE MOM AESTHETIC BACK. \n29. I am so sad Olivia Benson isn\u2019t Spencer\u2019s mother. Thank god she\u2019s still Melissa\u2019s mom, otherwise she\u2019d have to leave the Wine Mom Squad. \n30. PETER FUCKING HASTINGS. Can\u2019t you keep your goddamn dick in your pants for five fucking minutes? \n31. Also like, Peter saw Mary in a restaurant? And what, just after entr\u00e9es was all \u201chey babes come to the bathroom for a quickie\u201d? Ew. \n32. Olivia Benson why did you stay with Peter Hastings after this, goddamn you\u2019re better than that. \n33. S it sounds like Mary tricked Peter into sleeping with her by pretending she was Jessica? What the fuck is this show? \n34. Lmao this flashback of Spencer\u2019s birth should technically be set in the mid-90s, why are they all dressed like film noir characters from the \u201840s?

Informal egg roll parties were recorded at the White House during the early Lincoln administration.\nDuring the post-Civil War years, the Easter egg games were played on the grounds surrounding the U.S. Capitol Building. In 1876, an act of Congress outlawed the Capitol grounds and terraces from being used as playgrounds to protect the property from destruction. In 1878, President Rutherford B. Hayes officially opened the White House grounds to local children for egg rolling on Easter Monday.\nDuring World War I and II, the events were canceled. Dwight D. Eisenhower and First Lady Mamie Eisenhower revived the event in 1953 after a 12-year absence. In 1969, Pat Nixon's staff introduced the White House Easter Bunny, a staffer dressed in a white fleece bunny costume who roamed the grounds and welcomed the egg rollers and posed for photographs. By 1974 the activities evolved into organized egg-rolling races. The 1981 eggstravaganza included assorted clowns and characters, balloon vendors, Broadway show vignettes, a petting zoo, exhibits of antique cars, and an eggxposition of specially decorated eggs (one for each state). Each egg roller received a goody bag filled with a program, toy products supplied by corporate sponsors, and food- whose wrappers littered the lawn. Since 1987 the event's theme has been inscripted on each egg, and by 1989 George and Barbara Bush added their facsimile signatures. Today the official eggs are given one to a child (under 12) as they leave the South Lawn.\nRead More About Easter in Washington, DC\nRelated Articles Washington, DC's 2017 Major Annual Events Celebrating Easter in Washington, DC Easter in the United States Explore the White House Gardens on a Public Tour Fun Easter Egg Hunts Near Washington, DC Learn About Washington DC's Pro Sports Teams Our Expert Recommends Spring Family Fun in the DC Area 15 Best Places to Go with Kids in the DC Area Top 10 Things to Do in the DC Area Easter Brunch in Washington, DC Spring Break in Washington, DC National Cherry Blossom Festival Best Museums for Kids in Washington DC April Festivals and Events in Washington DC May Festivals and Events in Washington DC Washington, Holidays/Seasonal Events White House Easter Egg Roll 2017: Tickets, Talent & More "}, {"crawled": "2017-04-18T13:56:49.000+03:00", "title": "Create A Cocktail And We'll Reveal A Deep Truth About You", "external_links": [], "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "58c6dccb35b5127e2b16705e2f0a06a3f3aa4b0e", "author": "", "thread": {"section_title": "BuzzFeed - Latest", "title": "Create A Cocktail And We'll Reveal A Deep Truth About You", "site_full": "www.buzzfeed.com", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "facebook": {"comments": 27, "shares": 984, "likes": 984}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "title_full": "Create A Cocktail And We'll Reveal A Deep Truth About You", "site_type": "news", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRULI3Cl7YN6x1S4FCvs99GIsuTaXYuNSd1mDNQqK5TkNqCIPFyOFq6RYU4kIxyhxX20mwrQAcEmMi0OHFYnC8xCZnnm4YbOk8F4xbXCSzybL0784D2_eHd", "uuid": "58c6dccb35b5127e2b16705e2f0a06a3f3aa4b0e", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "domain_rank": 137, "spam_score": 0.0, "country": "US", "site": "buzzfeed.com", "main_image": "http://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-04/18/6/tmp/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/421506b1bee6e9984c6a570ee816e69b-4.jpg?crop=625:327;0,26", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/buzzfeed/UteY", "published": "2017-04-18T13:56:49.000+03:00", "performance_score": 9, "site_categories": []}, "highlightText": "", "rating": null, "ord_in_thread": 0, "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRULI3Cl7YN6x1S4FCvs99GIsuTaXYuNSd1mDNQqK5TkNqCIPFyOFq6RYU4kIxyhxX20mwrQAcEmMi0OHFYnC8xCZnnm4YbOk8F4xbXCSzybL0784D2_eHd", "published": "2017-04-18T13:56:49.000+03:00", "text": "Create A Cocktail And We'll Reveal A Deep Truth About You You got: You always want attention, until you get it \nWhile in your head you always want to be the centre of attention, you tend to shy away from the spotlight when it finally shines on you.

His performance as \"Tuck Bedford\"the fictional host of \"Brain Fight\"killed on two levels. First, it was a timely and obvious dig at Alex Jones, whose lawyer had just claimed the Infowars host was actually a performance artist. Then there was the obvious nod to the fact that Colbert himself became famous by portraying a right-wing pundit who at one point blurred the lines between fiction and reality.\nIt's sometimes difficult to remember that when The Colbert Report first came out, its host was so convincing, and the concept was so novel, that some interviewees didn't know what they were signing up for. While Sasha Baren Cohen benefitted from ambushing unsuspecting subjects as Ali G, his successor Colbert was able to famously own some early guests who didn't think that he would ask serious questions.\nLast year, author Lee Siegel claimed in the Columbia Journalism Review that Colbert's brand of punditry paved the way for the fake news of today . But Colbert's winks were always obvious, and his core audience always understood his meaning. The most successful conspiracy-mongers working in America today have a different strategy entirelythey say whatever they want, and if they're called on it, they can always claim they were joking. Call it the \"Colbert Defense.\" It's the ultimate get-out-of-jail-free cardand a way for people who cross the line to never have to take responsibility for their actions.\nA particularly blatant example of this came this week during Alex Jones's custody battle with his ex-wife, who claimed Jones was an unfit father because of the insane things he said on his popular radio program, Infowars. In response, Jones's lawyer said the host was just \" playing a character ,\" albeit a character who shared the real Alex Jones's name, occupation, and general outlook on life.\nJones is far from the first rabble-rouser to fall back on the Colbert Defense. We first got a whiff of this back in 2011, when Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain gave a speech in Tennessee calling for an Mexican border fence that was \"20 feet hight with barbed wire\" and \"electrified.\" The crowd cheered loudly as he also suggested it would be able to kill Mexicans. After people got pissed, Cain backtracked on Meet the Press , claiming that his comments were just a joke and that \"America [needed] to get a sense of humor.\"\nCain wouldn't be the last right-winger to complain about being taken too literally. During an extremely ill-considered appearance on Colbert , FOXNews diatribe machine Bill O'Reilly was asked who would win in a fight between him and fellow FOXhost Sean Hannity. \"I'm effete. I'm not a tough guy,\" he said. \"This is all an act.\" Colbert responded with a meta commentary on things to come: \"If you're an act, then what am I?\"\nSince then, political commentary has become increasingly like pro wrestlingexcept no one breaks kayfabe. And though Colbert's audience was largely liberals who wanted to laugh at the right-wing blowhards the comedian was satirizing, O'Reilly and Jones are playing \"characters\" that appeal to people who mostly share their views. \nThis can get very confusing. Rush Limbaugh has been relying on sensationalism and bombast for decades, but almost no one would question whether he believes what he says. In 2008, Glenn Beck moved over from CNN to FOXNews and made a splash for being even more provocative. In constantly railing against progressivism a \"cancer,\" he basically invented the kind of punditry that birthed stars like Milo Yiannopoulos,who wouldlater use the same word repeatedly to describe feminism.\nNotably, Beck went on full-blown apology tour after realizing he helped create Donald Trump. \"I could excuse it, to some degreeI won'tbut I could excuse some of it by saying that I was trying to, in some ways, accomplish what Jon Stewart can accomplish: draw huge crowds, make points and then encourage you to do your own homework,\" he told the New York Times . That fits the pattern of rightwingers distancing themselves from their most hateful rhetoric. After Yiannopoulos got fired from his job at Breitbart for appearing to defend pederasty, he claimed that his schtick was a joke.\n\"The videos do not show what people say they show,\" he said in a Facebook statement. \"I did joke about giving better head as a result of clerical sexual abuse committed against me when I was a teen. If I choose to deal in an edgy way on an internet livestream with a crime I was the victim of that's my prerogative. It's no different to gallows humor from AIDS sufferers.\"\n\nIt's doubtful that many people turn to Yiannopoulos or Jones for satire. Certainly the guy who showed up at a DC pizza restaurant with a gun to \"investigate\" the pizzagateconspiracy that Infowars helped spread didn't think he was watching a comedy program. (Jones later apologized for his coverage of the nonsensical theory.) \nOf course, it's one thing if the average Infowars listener doesn't know if he or she isbeing sold entertainment or news. It's much more terrifying when the president of the United States ( himself a Jones fan ) is playing the same game where it's unclear how seriously or literally we're supposed to take him. During a campaign event in July, Trump suggested that Russian hackers should go looking for Hillary Clinton's deleted emails, then after an outcry claimed he was being sarcastic .\nMaybe he was. But sarcasm and politics don't mix well, and not everyone is equipped with the same joke radar. Colbert, for one, knew this. In a 2006 interview on 60 Minutes , he was asked if his kids watched his show. \"Kids can't understand irony or sarcasm,\" he told Morley Safer. Maybe neither can Jones's audience?\nFollow Allie Conti on Twitter ."}, {"crawled": "2017-04-18T12:33:02.000+03:00", "title": "Woman found guilty of Jeremy Vine road rage attack to appeal conviction", "external_links": [], "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "85848dd8473b0dfb884250496f38e65ee50ed769", "author": "", "thread": {"section_title": "National Updates", "title": "Woman found guilty of Jeremy Vine road rage attack to appeal conviction", "site_full": "www.itv.com", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 981, "likes": 981}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "title_full": "Woman found guilty of Jeremy Vine road rage attack to appeal conviction", "site_type": "news", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9ibLms25NnVImzYjE9lMy4Z_CXUzN9Vqwxx9yResAhC9LDBecrz_SzEIc5PQu1vmt9sch_6yI65A1C_GPzkMIDq02ii4FKWahQdsbIKCd6woUQmH0Ksr9L", "uuid": "85848dd8473b0dfb884250496f38e65ee50ed769", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "domain_rank": 2701, "spam_score": 0.0, "country": "US", "site": "itv.com", "main_image": "http://news-assets.sn.itv.com/image/file/1277916/img.jpg", "site_section": "http://www.itv.com/news/index.rss", "published": "2017-04-18T12:33:02.000+03:00", "performance_score": 9, "site_categories": []}, "highlightText": "", "rating": null, "ord_in_thread": 0, "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9ibLms25NnVImzYjE9lMy4Z_CXUzN9Vqwxx9yResAhC9LDBecrz_SzEIc5PQu1vmt9sch_6yI65A1C_GPzkMIDq02ii4FKWahQdsbIKCd6woUQmH0Ksr9L", "published": "2017-04-18T12:33:02.000+03:00", "text": "18 April 2017 at 10:01am Jeremy Vine road rage attacker jailed for nine months Jeremy Vine and Shanique Syrena Pearson. \nA female driver who threatened and abused BBC presenter Jeremy Vine in a 'road rage' attack has been jailed for nine months. \nShanique Syrena Pearson, 22, threatened to knock out Mr Vine and kicked his bike in a confrontation as he cycled to work in west London. \nThe altercation was caught on a helmet camera worn by the 51-year-old Crimewatch presenter and has since been viewed millions of times. \nPearson, a single mother with a son aged three, broke down in tears as she was told she would spend at least half of her sentence behind bars. \nThis was a bad case of loss of control by you, letting your anger take over. \nIt has happened in the past. \u2013 Judge Phillip Matthews Shanique Syrena Pearson's police mugshot after her arrest.

Posted on Share \nON a blue sky morning in Sydney, M sits on the terrace of a Glebe cafe fiddling with her coffee spoon while the 433 bus grinds to a stop across the road. A few passengers step off and head towards the sprawling University of Sydney campus down the street. \nM, from Sydney, is in her early 20s, with blonde hair and a gap between her two upper front teeth. She\u2019s around 5\u20197, wears a size 12 and loves young adult fantasy novels. On a busy night at the legal brothel where she works, M can take home $300-400. \nLike many who work in the sex industry M hasn\u2019t told her friends or family how she makes money. The sex industry was decriminalised in New South Wales in 1995, so there\u2019s no risk of arrest, but social stigma is ever present. She agreed to speak to me and introduce me to the girls she works with, on the condition she remain anonymous. \n\u201cI have to weave these elaborate lies with my parents so they don\u2019t figure out where I\u2019m working,\u201d she told me. \nAside from New Zealand, the Australian state of New South Wales is the only place in the world where both the purchase and sale of sex without registration is not considered a criminal act. There are restrictions, such as not working near schools and in residential areas, but the consequences from the decision to decriminalise sex work have been remarkable. \nThe rates of sexually transmitted infections are low, as are incidents of physical and sexual violence. In NSW sex work is a relatively safe and lucrative job option. Certainly, some women are forced into the sex trade even in places where it\u2019s been decriminalised. But many enter the industry willingly, and they have a variety of reasons for pursuing this line of work. M used her earnings to fund a costly degree, and she's far from the only student turning to sex work to make ends meet. \nIN Australia an undergraduate degree can cost up to $10,000 a year in course fees. And that\u2019s for Commonwealth-supported degrees. On top of fees, a student living out of home can expect to have to find up to $615 to cover bills each week. (Sydney and Melbourne are in the top ten most expensive cities in the world). \nAccommodation: $300Groceries, food and household products: $150Utility bills: $45Public transport costs: $10Study expenses such as printing, photocopying, stationery: $10 \nPlus one off costs such as new textbooks each semester ($300+), rental bond ($1000+), house appliances and furniture. \u201cIt just so happens that sex work is a very lucrative job. As a uni student, when you have such heavy course work, what else do they expect you to do?\u201d Share \nWhile studying M was also expected to fund expensive travel as part of her course, with trips costing up to $4000. \n\u201cThere are very few jobs that are flexible enough to make that possible,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just so happens that sex work is a very lucrative job. As a uni student, when you have such heavy course work, what else do they expect you to do?\u201d \nI studied for five years in Sydney, but I was lucky that my parents lived a 10 minute walk from my university, so I stayed at home for almost four of those years. Even so, I still didn\u2019t manage to save any money from various retail jobs. \nIT'S difficult to determine how many students such as M work in the Australian sex industry, but a University of New South Wales report estimated there are just over 100 brothels within 20km of the Sydney CBD, employing a total of around 3000 workers. In Victoria and Queensland sex workers are required to register in order to work legally and in the other states and territories the industry remains illegal. \nTwenty years after sex work was decriminalised, a NSW government inquiry confirmed the current system was in the best interests of the workers, clients and the general public. \nWhen I was in the penultimate year of my degree I met a girl named Alannah who lived in a beautiful house in an affluent Sydney suburb. She always seemed to have enough money to buy lunch and go out for drinks on the weekend. After a while she told me she gave hand jobs for money. She always seemed to have enough money to buy lunch and go out for drinks on the weekend. After a while she told me she gave hand jobs for money. Share \nONE night, I went with M to the inner Sydney brothel where she works. The girls, as the workers, mostly in their early 20s, refer to themselves, offer a service known as a rub and tug \u2013 providing naked massages and \u201chand relief\u201d for clients. The brothel recently introduced the option for men to choose \u201cfull service\u201d bookings (including sex) for a higher fee, but the majority of the girls only perform hand jobs. I\u2019m told only about one in twenty men who come in are after the full service. \nFrom the outside the brothel is an inconspicuous brick building, and the only hint at the nature of the business within is a neon sign bearing the brothel's name. It\u2019s been in the same place for 20 years. The walls are pink, the leather couches brown and the spas baby blue. It\u2019s not tacky but rather welcoming and cozy. \nOn a Tuesday night there are seven to 15 girls working. Potential clients enter and hang out in a lounge area. The girls walk past and introduce themselves one at a time. Some are in short party dresses, some in lingerie covered with a lacy robe, some in leotards. All wear high heels and makeup. \nOn \u201cFantasy Thursdays\u201d the girls dress up in costumes ranging from sexy Snow White to a sexy nurse. Groups arrive on Friday and Saturday nights; each client books a girl and they all party together in a spa. \n\u201cParty spas are the most fun, because you\u2019re not just stuck with one guy in the spa for an hour,\u201d one girl told me. \u201cIt\u2019s a bunch of guys, and a bunch of girls, we crack open the champagne, and it\u2019s usually pretty enjoyable.\u201d \nWhen there are no clients the girls wait together. Some use the in-house computers to work on university assignments; others watch movies or read. They appear as a bunch of friends just hanging out. \nA few of the girls tell me that they started out working retail, but had to jag 25 hours a week just to cover rent and groceries, leaving them no time to actually study. Here, they can make at least $90 for a 75 minute booking. On busy nights, a girl can take home more than $400 for a six hour shift. And they can set their own working hours. But one girl tells me that sex workers need to have a strong character, because \u201cit\u2019s something that can really break you\u201d. \nIN 1994 the Supreme Court of Victoria, in justifying a light sentence for the rape of a prostitute, upheld a precedent that a prostitute who is raped is much less likely to feel psychological trauma than a \u201cchaste\u201d woman who isn\u2019t involved in sex work. This sent a loud message: sex workers are to be treated differently. Share \nLucie Bee (a pseudonym) is an escort, porn star and activist for sex workers\u2019 rights who started in the industry five years ago when she was studying in Canberra, where sex work is still criminalised. \nOne time, Bee said, she was invited to speak on a panel at her old university during Sex and Consent Week. The Facebook page for the event was flooded with messages from women shaming her, telling her she\u2019s ill-educated, a victim of anal rape and a puppet for the sex industry. Some even went as far as finding out her real name, threatening to \u201cout\u201d her publicly. \n\u201cThe fact I have a willingness to speak out about these things openly, without fear or shame, seems to really piss people off,\u201d she told BuzzFeed. \nMany of the sex workers I spoke to don't reveal the nature of their work to friends, family or fellow students. They\u2019ve spent years earning (expensive) degrees and don\u2019t want to threaten future job opportunities. \nEven where sex work is legal it attracts what UK based sex industry researcher Teela Sanders dubs \u201cwhorephobia.\u201d She says this social stigma is one of the most harmful downsides of sex work because secrecy can distance workers from their friends and family, leaving them more vulnerable to the effects of stress. \n\u201cIt\u2019s isolating, when you\u2019re doing something that none of your friends do, or even know about,\u201d Bee said. \u201cSometimes you can have a bad day, sometimes all your clients are just pricks... and you can\u2019t talk about it.\u201d \nM has experienced this emotional isolation first hand. Even her sister, who works as a topless waitress, doesn't know she's doing sex work. She confided in a friend who considers herself a feminist, but was met with the statement that sex work is \u201cso detrimental to women.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m happy to be a feminist and to work where I do. She can\u2019t tell me that the two don\u2019t mix, they definitely do.\u201d Share \n\u201cIt was really hurtful at the time,\u201d M said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to be a feminist and to work where I do. She can\u2019t tell me that the two don\u2019t mix, they definitely do.\u201d \nFeminists are divided on whether sex work is demeaning or empowering. Those in the former group want to reverse decriminalisation, arguing that for true equality to exist all activities where women are considered a \u201cman\u2019s object\u201d or products to be sold or rented need to be eliminated. \nThose who support a woman\u2019s right to undertake sex work view it as a means with which to fight repression. They argue that it is much more acceptable for men to celebrate their sexuality and explore their bodies outside of marriage than it is for women, who are quickly labelled as \u201ceasy\u201d or \u201cwhores\u201d. By working in the sex industry, women are fighting this double standard while also capitalising on their bodies. \nSome of the girls I speak to talk about an increased assertiveness and self worth, but really, the key driver is cash. It\u2019s not about smashing the patriarchy by making money off hand jobs, it\u2019s about being able to pay all your bills and have enough money left over for a night out. Most can\u2019t understand the negativity they face for using their sexuality to make money. \n\u201c[Men are] fine to go and parade their sexuality around as much as they want,\u201d M said. \u201cBut God forbid a woman wear a short dress and make decisions about what she does with her body. Because women are choosing to be \u2018objectified\u2019, that\u2019s why society isn\u2019t OK with it.\u201d \nNOT every man who visits M\u2019s workplace is there for sex or a hand job \u2013 some come back regularly, just to hang out. Some are single and looking for a new friend, while others find it difficult to talk through particular issues with their wife or partner. \nMark falls in the latter group. He\u2019s been seeing sex workers for 22 years after breaking up with a girlfriend in his early 30s. He claims he was too shy to meet a new partner through traditional means. Ever since, he\u2019s been going to brothels all over Sydney, making connections with different girls. \nMark is in his fifties, and he\u2019s really old school \u2013 he enters wearing a khaki coloured suit, with a pink handkerchief in the breast pocket. M tells me that he tucks his singlet into his underwear. He stands up to meet the women and makes conversation with them rather than just saying a quick hello. He doesn't always want a hand job either, sometimes he just wants to sit in the spa and enjoy the company of a naked girl. He seems lonely. \n\u201cI tell my married friends I come here and they get jealous,\u201d he said. But, he added: \u201cGirls who work here shouldn't tell anyone they do it... people will get the wrong idea.\u201d \nThere is, it seems, one rule for men and another for women. M believes this double standard also applies to men working in the sex industry. \n\u201cMale strippers tell their families and friends what they do,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can be open with it and be proud of it. It\u2019s never treated in the same way that female sex workers are.\u201d \u201cMale strippers tell their families and friends what they do,\u201d she says. \u201cThey can be open with it and be proud of it.

I thought that this show started with this woman who had everything in her life planned and then her life spun out of control with this unexpected pregnancy and we\u2019ve been sort of mining the drama and comedy from that ever since and at the midpoint of the show, I always knew she was going to lose her husband and I was always afraid to do it.\u201dIn between, Dier joked after some prodding from the \nDier joked after some prodding from the Late Late Show host that despite this being the plan, he didn\u2019t know this was the journey he was going to go on. \n\u201cIt was terrible,\u201d Urman continued. \u201cIt was heartbreaking. I put a line in the first season that said, \u2018For as long as Michael lived, he would love Jane.\u2019 That was really to force myself to carry through with what I thought the story arc was despite how much we loved Brett and how charming he was and how much audiences loved him. I really every day would come into the writers\u2019 room and there would be three people like, \u2018We can\u2019t kill him.\u2019 And then\u2026 we\u2019d go through what we could do and we\u2019d go through all these stories and stories and stories and then we would come out at the end and say, \u2018No, definitely, he\u2019s gotta die.\u2019\u201d \nRELATED: Jane the Virgin showrunner on THAT shocking twist \nAnd so he did and so it was heartbreaking, but the dramedy took some of that devastating edge off by flashing ahead three years. \u201cI felt like it was an opportunity to really massively grow and to become this mother and to hunker down, and the routine she has now and the way she sees sex is different, the way she views relationships and love and destiny and fate,\u201d Rodriguez said of exploring her character, now a widow and single mother, following that leap. \u201cShe\u2019s become\u2026 a little cynical. It\u2019s interesting to take this blossoming character that was so full of life, to actually now start having what we can all relate to, what becomes our traumas that start to shape us. Jane was my big first character to live with for this long, but how often do we get to see a show [where] we actually get to see somebody then affected by their traumas and who they become after that?\u201d \nShe makes a good point, but all that\u2019s not to say that Jane is now a cynic. On the contrary, Urman echoes that our heroine is shaken by the death but gets her fantastical worldview somewhat back \u2014 in part, it seems, by falling in love once more. \nRELATED: Jane the Virgin actor and EP pen letters to fans following big twist \n\u201cWill we ever see Jane truly romantically involved and moving on with someone else?\u201d Corden asked. \n\u201cYes,\u201d Urman answered, a response that was met by gasps from the audience, with Corden yelling about how Dier is right there in the room. \u201cPart of the journey is, like Gina said, she started out this optimistic, romantic dreamer and then she was hit by reality in a really big way. What I want to see in the back half of the series is how she regains some of that optimism, some of that love, and starts to believe in romance again and how it\u2019s different from what she first thought it was, so we\u2019re going to get into that and how does Jane believe in magic again.\u201d \nRight, but who will she move on with and when will it happen? That, is the question. \nIn the meantime, here\u2019s more to look forward to\u2026 \n\u2022 \u201cWe change [the episode introductions] depending on the theme, and the feeling is that [Jane] was defined by her virginity for so long, but obviously she\u2019s so much more, so we were trying to expand the definition of what Jane is,\u201d Urman said, then teasing one that\u2019s coming up. \u201cYou\u2019ll see \u2018Jane the Horndog\u2019 pretty soon.\u201d Could that be a reference to Jane\u2019s attraction to Rogelio\u2019s good looking new costar\u2026 \u2022 Speaking of, Camil said that attraction will create some tension between Rogelio and the costar. Tension indeed, as Urman explained, \u201cThere\u2019s a fight during crew lunch.\u201d \u2022 More seriously, \u201cWe feel a responsibility to react to this presidency,\u201d Urman said about where the show, which addressed abortion this season, stands in the current, political climate. \u201cWe have an episode coming up that deals with Jane\u2019s son Mateo [asking] why people don\u2019t want Abuela in this country. We start to talk about immigration and the raids and how do you explain that to your children? We try to take anything that\u2019s political and put it in the realm of our family and the hope is that by making people look at people and not positions, we can encourage empathy.\u201d \nCatch Jane the Virgin when it returns after a few weeks away on Monday, April 24 at 9 p.m. E.T. on The CW.

After calling your parents, sharing engagement selfies on Facebook, and generally basking in the glow of eternal love, now comes the hard part: You have a wedding to plan. And that\u2019s going to involve a lot of money, tedious logistics, a talent for diplomacy, and more money.\nIn this day and age, we have plenty of tech tools and cool apps at our disposal. The problem is, they\u2019re not all found in a single toolbox. When I got married five years ago, my husband and I used all these wedding planning resources: The Knot\u2019s wedding website maker; two separate online registries from Amazon and Crate & Barrel; Minted\u2019s card-sending service for our save-the-dates, invitations, and thank-you notes; and lots and lots of Google Doc spreadsheets to keep track of all of our guests\u2019 information and budgeting.\nAnd we still ended up hiring a wedding planner.\nFounder and CEO Shan-Lyn Ma and cofounder Nobu Nakaguchi . \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have to be this hard,\u201d Shan-Lyn Ma, cofounder and CEO of Zola, tells Fast Company . \u201cWe\u2019ve come up with user-friendly apps for everything from online shopping to finding a taxi. And yet wedding planning tools haven\u2019t improved much over the last decade.\u201d\nMa, who previously worked at Chloe + Isabel and Gilt, is setting out to fix this problem. Today, Zola is launching a suite of tools designed to ferry a couple from their engagement through their first year of marriage. In addition to the current registry feature, Zola will now offer customizable wedding websites, a system that automatically pings guests for their addresses, and a checklist feature that comes pre-loaded with tasks specific to a couple\u2019s specific religious or cultural traditions.\nThese tools are not particularly complicated or original.

After calling your parents, sharing engagement selfies on Facebook, and generally basking in the glow of eternal love, now comes the hard part: You have a wedding to plan. And that\u2019s going to involve a lot of money, tedious logistics, a talent for diplomacy, and more money.\nIn this day and age, we have plenty of tech tools and cool apps at our disposal. The problem is, they\u2019re not all found in a single toolbox. When I got married five years ago, my husband and I used all these wedding planning resources: The Knot\u2019s wedding website maker; two separate online registries from Amazon and Crate & Barrel; Minted\u2019s card-sending service for our save-the-dates, invitations, and thank-you notes; and lots and lots of Google Doc spreadsheets to keep track of all of our guests\u2019 information and budgeting.\nAnd we still ended up hiring a wedding planner.\nFounder and CEO Shan-Lyn Ma and cofounder Nobu Nakaguchi . \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t have to be this hard,\u201d Shan-Lyn Ma, cofounder and CEO of Zola, tells Fast Company . \u201cWe\u2019ve come up with user-friendly apps for everything from online shopping to finding a taxi. And yet wedding planning tools haven\u2019t improved much over the last decade.\u201d\nMa, who previously worked at Chloe + Isabel and Gilt, is setting out to fix this problem. Today, Zola is launching a suite of tools designed to ferry a couple from their engagement through their first year of marriage. In addition to the current registry feature, Zola will now offer customizable wedding websites, a system that automatically pings guests for their addresses, and a checklist feature that comes pre-loaded with tasks specific to a couple\u2019s specific religious or cultural traditions.\n\nThese tools are not particularly complicated or original. But what makes them so powerful is that they are now all available in a single place and are all integrated with one another.

Rumors started to swirl last year about a beef between the two behemoth action stars on the set of The Fate of the Furious , and the way the movie is edited even seems to show the disconnect between them. However, it now appears that the two Fast and Furious stars have made peace with each other, as The Rock has reportedly agreed to sign on for the ninth installment alongside Diesel. \nA new report from TMZ seems to indicate that Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel have worked through the differences that arose on the set of The Fate of the Furious . The feud reportedly centered around the concept of \"real estate,\" meaning that the two big name actors were fighting for top dog status on the recent blockbuster. According to the report, Dwayne Johnson was ultimately the one who acquiesced -- allowing Vin Diesel to take on the role as the face of the franchise while Luke Hobbs will remain as a supporting player in the Fast and Furious world. The Feud of the Furious looks to be over, and not a moment too soon for the major tentpole franchise. \nGetting The Rock to stand down on that real estate issue was probably not that difficult in the long run. After all, it's not like he has a shortage of projects on the horizon. The guy's calendar is all booked up for the foreseeable future. The Fast and Furious franchise has been Vin Diesel's primary starring vehicle (pun intended) for the better part of the last decade, while The Rock has several different irons in several different fires across a wide range of franchises and genres; he can easily let this one go and remain one of the biggest stars in the world. \nThe feud between Dwayne Johnson and Vin Diesel exploded last year when Johnson took to social media to complain about an unspecified member of the Fast and Furious ensemble. It seemed as if he were referring to Diesel, and members of the cast ( Tyrese Gibson in particular) slowly but surely chimed in to try and smooth things out. Things between Johnson and Diesel remained tense until recently, as The Fate of the Furious apparently went to great lengths to keep Hobbs and Dom Toretto separate from one another, and the two actors barely did any press events together to promote the movie. Rumors have even persisted that Vin Diesel demanded that Universal cut a sequence between Johnson and Jason Statham showing off the chemistry between Hobbs and Deckard Shaw , but now it seems that all parties have come to a consensus concerning how to proceed with this franchise as it moves into its ninth installment. \nNo matter whose side you were on during this feud, I think it's safe to say that we're glad to learn that Hobbs and Dom will both return to the Fast and Furious world for the next film. The Fate of the Furious is currently in theaters , so make sure to check it out!

And with the release of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad , the DCEU has stepped up to the plate in an attempt to compete with its comic book rival. But while the MCU took their time developing a character at a time before Joss Whedon's The Avengers , the DCEU has ordered a ton of new movies to expand the universe, including Whedon's upcoming Batgirl film . So how does Marvel feel about Whedon jumping ship? \nIt turns out, they don't care all that much. Marvel president Kevin Feige recently spoke to THR , revealing how the Joss Whedon/DC situation went down. He said, \nHe called. A couple months ago, which he didn't have to do and was super cool of him and super nice of him... And we couldn't be more supportive. We want to see a Joss Whedon Batgirl film be awesome. \nWell, this seems a lot less ugly than I was anticipating. Both Kevin Feige and Joss Whedon seemed to have taken the classy higher ground in this potentially awkward situation. Which is probably why we haven't heard much response from Marvel regarding Whedon's Batgirl announcement. \nAs far as logistics go, Joss Whedon's inclusion in the DCEU doesn't actually affect Marvel in any way. Whedon left the universe a few years ago, and the Russo Brothers have since taken on the responsibility of shaping the universe and helming the next Avengers films. So while Marvel's ego may have been hit by Whedon working for the enemy, virtually nothing changed due to his departure. \nThe other side of this equation is that comic book fans may be a bit weary of Joss Whedon after his work in the divisive Avengers: Age of Ultron . Whedon was the target of the trolls' fury, with fanboys seemingly forgetting how Whedon helped the Avengers come together in the first place. \nAnd in reality, Joss Whedon may be the most appropriate and prepared director to help the untitled Batgirl movie. Whedon's bread and butter is strong female characters; many closely associate the director with his outstanding work in the long running series Buffy the Vampire Slayer . Since then, he's brought more badass female characters to life with his Eliza Dushku led show Dollhouse , in addition to his work with Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow during the first two Avengers movies. \nAnd with Marvel's blessing, now we just have to wait and see what comes from Joss Whedon's untitled Batgirl movie.

I couldn't say, \"I don't know.\" It really weighed on my conscious to give people answers that I knew could be hurtful to them. I think a lot of people find Orthodox Judaisma source of joy. I'm all for that, if that's what they want. But at times, it was clearly not. Some people were just made to suffer. \nI found it very liberating to not have belief. It's hard to live knowing that there's a God in the sky that will punish you if you don't do a certain ritual at a certain time in a certain way. It's a lot easier this way. I don't miss it at all. \nJohn Gibbs, former Methodist minister When I was in my 20s I had a personal crisis, kind of after a breakup. I had graduated from college but I just didn't really have any real direction. I just felt like I was drifting and that I didn't like how that felt. I started going back to church then, and it was pretty soon after that that I decided to do what people my whole life had been asking me to do, which was to follow in my father's footsteps. So I went to seminary. Then I fell into a faith crisis. I didn't get to the point where I could say I was an Atheist yet, though, but it was more just questioning the specifics of Christianity, like the divinity of Christ and the resurrection. I never really had a strong belief in those things to begin with, though. I began looking at Christianity as a myth, and not in a favorable sense. From then on, I really struggled with that question of: what am I doing here? I began to regularly ask myself how I could get out.\nSo, I spent a year or so preaching out of the Old Testament and working on how to wrap my head around Christianity's mythological perspective. When I decided to leave, my congregationwere relieved. They saw what I was going through, and it wasn't pretty. Some of them were glad to see me go, others were concerned for my well-being. But I think everyone felt like me being removed was for the best.\nI didn't know what to do with myself on Sundays besides go to church, so I didn't really leave the church... Then I realized that I had been looking for something that I repeatedly had not found.I know a lot of people think there's not enough community around. Religion isabout the community. It's about feeling validated.I've spent a lot of time thinking about how to bring some resources into the secular culture that I think are valuable. Like some warmth. Some basis for community to coalesce around.\nScott, former monk within the Self-Realization Fellowship I always thought there was something more deep to life, rather than just what the eye could see. I got really into eastern practices of religion when I was in college. I was at a party and a friend recommended The Autobiography of a Yogi [the autobiography of Self-Realization Fellowship founderParamahansa Yogananda]to me.I got hope from it, and frankly a lot of that was wishful thinking. I wanted there to be more than the eye could see. Once I joined, it was stifling in there. You weren't officially allowed to read other books or see other movies. We got to see movies once a month, and they were screened and censored. Same with the books. Self realization should be about just thatrealizing yourself. It's a frustrating feeling. That was what led me out. It wasn't really the \"God\" question, it was more, \"Why doesn't the system work?\" I wasn't feeling what I thought I should, and I was putting it back on myself. I would tell myself I wasn't practicing it right. But then I realized, no, I was just beating myself up. It's not me, it's the system.\n\nEJ Hill, founder of a Dutch-Reformed church in South Africa I was born into the Dutch Reformed Church of South Africa, but at the age of sixteen I had a \"supernatural experience\", or at least, that is how I interpreted it at the time. I was convinced that God revealed Himself to me, because I was chosen to fulfill a special purpose. For almost twentyone years I spent most of my free time in Bible study and Apologetics. Slowly, but surely, I started looking at the Bible more critically. I quickly discovered that the God of the Bible approved of many things that I simply could not approve of, namely forced abortion, slavery, misogyny, and deception by proxy to name but a few. I quickly realized that all I,and everyone else for that matter,wasdoing, was to confirm in our own minds that which we believed God approved of. The \"small still voice\"in our heads, were in fact ours, not God's. Losing my faith was one of the worst experiences of my life. My whole world fell apart. Lost many friends. Lost my wife. Lost my credibility.I had already left full-time ministry a few years earlier to pursue an independent Christian ministry. My online and offline followers were devastated. I received a lot of requests for clarification, hatemail, and criticism.\n\nI certainly do not hate the Church. I love people. Even those who disagree with me. Even those who dislike me.Despite their beliefs, churches do feed, clothe, comfort, and educate a large number of people. To simply discount that would be dishonest and short-sighted, to say the least.\nI do, however, think that they are wasting a lot of time, effort, and money on nonsense.\nDrew Bekius, former Baptist minister I was part of what's known as \"ceaseless prayer,\" which is the idea that you always have a constant conversation with God going on in the back of your mind at all times. During this time in my life, it turned to me begging and pleading with God to erase my doubt, to rebuild my faith. The Bible makes a lot of promises that you just have to humbly seek god and he will restore your faith. I'd say, \"Okay, I'm seeking you. So build it. I've been seeking it. Please help me. One more time, please, please help me. You promised to rebuild it. So rebuild it.\" I was constantly seeking and constantly confessing, continually crying out.\nWhen you're a regular person going to church, you might come across these questions and you say, of course, I'm just a regular person, this isn't my profession and I haven't studied it, so of course it doesn't make sense to me. But you also might think, but it makes sense to the guy up there preaching. But we're all up there, and we're like, well, it doesn't make sense to us either . It's kind of like Dorothy looking behind the curtain and seeing that this great, big flaming Oz is really just a guy pulling levers. That's what it's like for us too. We've looked behind the curtain, and it's just a bunch of levers."}, {"crawled": "2017-04-19T00:24:09.000+03:00", "title": "Looking Back At The Sexual Politics Of \u201cChasing Amy\u201d 20 Years Later", "external_links": [], "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "4adcdd0e640bb8ad7a9b4ad390292d2019927c0f", "author": "Shannon Keating Buzzfeed News Reporter", "thread": {"section_title": "", "title": "Looking Back At The Sexual Politics Of \u201cChasing Amy\u201d 20 Years Later", "site_full": "www.buzzfeed.com", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "facebook": {"comments": 13, "shares": 956, "likes": 956}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "title_full": "Looking Back At The Sexual Politics Of \u201cChasing Amy\u201d 20 Years Later", "site_type": "news", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRULI3Cl7YN6x1S4FCvs99GKqHCPpGZzqI2NNFUrkhEgK8WeT_tfzEaiLewfpLL_UBuckdBCqgbuHAjvJMq0mWw", "uuid": "4adcdd0e640bb8ad7a9b4ad390292d2019927c0f", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "domain_rank": 137, "spam_score": 0.036, "country": "US", "site": "buzzfeed.com", "main_image": "http://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-04/18/17/enhanced/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-02/original-9348-1492550139-2.jpg?crop=990:518;0,0", "site_section": "", "published": "2017-04-18T08:00:00.000+03:00", "performance_score": 9, "site_categories": []}, "highlightText": "", "rating": null, "ord_in_thread": 0, "entities": {"persons": [{"sentiment": "neutral", "name": "kevin smith"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "jenny schecter"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dwight ewell"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "carmen lee"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "todd haynes"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "rose troche"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "abdellatif kechiche"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "carol"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "joey lauren adams  after smith"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ellen"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "guin"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "banky"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dee rees"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "hooper"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "lisa cholodenko"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "james bond"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ellen degeneres"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "holden"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "alyssa"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "adams"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "smith"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "jason lee"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ben"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "amy"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "scott mosier"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "lee"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "joey adams"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "desiree akhavan"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "affleck"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kevin"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "mosier"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "joey lauren adams"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "turner"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "guinevere turner"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "miramax"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "brodie"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ben affleck"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "janet maslin"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "degeneres"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "scott"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "new york"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "west hollywood"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "bali"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "holden"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "turner"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "manhattan"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "los angeles"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "jersey"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "new jersey"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "park chan-wook"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "new york times"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "turner"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "sundance"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "showtime"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "chasing amy premiere"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRULI3Cl7YN6x1S4FCvs99GKqHCPpGZzqI2NNFUrkhEgK8WeT_tfzEaiLewfpLL_UBuckdBCqgbuHAjvJMq0mWw", "published": "2017-04-18T08:00:00.000+03:00", "text": "Holden and Alyssa kissing in the rain, C hasing Amy , 1997. Miramax ID: 10910426 The third film in Kevin Smith\u2019s View Askewniverse series, Chasing Amy was a commercial as well as a critical success: Grossing over $12 million on a $250,000 budget, it garnered mostly positive reviews and won two Independent Spirit Awards. A sometimes charming, sometimes infuriating rom-com dressed up as a raunchy buddy comedy, Chasing Amy pushed the boundaries of sexual mores, pitted the casual (and sometimes not-so-casual) misogyny of comic book culture against budding male vulnerability, and tackled the complications of love and friendship in ways that deeply connected with a generation of almost-adults in the \u201990s who were just figuring out how to grow up.\n\u201cWhen you look at it now \u2014 to borrow a term from the present \u2014 it was very woke for 1997.\u201d\nID: 10910680 For the New York Times , Janet Maslin wrote that the film \u201credefines the boy-meets-girl formula for a culture where anything goes\u201d and that Smith\u2019s \u201cknowing humor and unruffled style\u201d makes for \u201ca good antidote to gender chaos.\u201d When Chasing Amy entered wide release, 20 years ago today, both lesbian and mainstream culture were wracked with battles over identity politics and political correctness \u2014 battles which, in 2017, are now raging afresh. Questions about how to define different queer identities, the possibilities and limits of sexual fluidity, and what mysterious chemistry drives attraction are as much a part of the contemporary queer conversation as they were in the mid-\u201990s. Chasing Amy was, in many ways, ahead of its time.\n\u201cThe weird thing about it is, you know, when you look at it now \u2014 to borrow a term from the present \u2014 it was very woke for 1997,\u201d Kevin Smith told me during a recent phone interview. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from people, like, \u2018Hey, it holds up!\u2019 And some people are like, \u2018Eh, it holds up, but some of it is kind of dated.\u2019\u201d\nAt the time of its release, and in the years since , a number of queer critics and academics have criticized the film for attempting to school its audience of primarily straight nerd-bros in Lesbianism 101 (how sex between women works; virginity as a social construct) only to end up punishing its lesbian character for her sloppy sexual history. It\u2019s much less a lesbian film than it is a clueless bro\u2019s coming-of-age story that just happens to have a lesbian character \u2014 and she exists, for the most part, in the service of the straight dude, kickstarting his evolution without getting much in return. Ultimately, the film assumes that a lesbian can go straight, even if just for a little while, as soon as the right guy comes along.\nView this image \u203a\nThe poster for Chasing Amy Miramax / Courtesy Everett Collection\nID: 10910620 Twenty years after its release, Chasing Amy is \u201ccertainly not an important film for the gay community,\u201d Smith told me, reflecting on its legacy. \u201cIt\u2019s an important film for me.\u201d Smith has said over the years that Chasing Amy was inspired by his producing partner\u2019s crush on lesbian filmmaker Guinevere Turner, his brother being gay, and his relationship with the film\u2019s star \u2014 various personal experiences thrown into a fictional blender. \u201cIt depicted dudes who were maybe on the verge of waking up, so to speak. But no, I think Chasing Amy is important only to me, at the end of the day.\u201d\nAt one point during our conversation, Smith got audibly choked up, remembering the moment when Miramax said it was going to buy the film. \u201cIt changed everything.\u201d\nBut Chasing Amy was more than a turning point for Smith\u2019s career \u2014 it coincided with a major shift in popular lesbian culture. Just weeks after its release in 1997, the now-famous \u201cPuppy Episode\u201d of Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s sitcom Ellen saw her character come out of the closet, inspiring immediate backlash and kicking off DeGeneres\u2019s legacy as one of the world\u2019s most well-known lesbians. DeGeneres and others have since helped to normalize a certain brand of modest, white, domesticated homosexuality , while everything from fan-favorite queer web series like Little Horribles to critically acclaimed romantic dramas like Todd Haynes\u2019 Carol have introduced modern audiences to dozens of different lesbian characters (some of whom even manage not to get killed off in the end).\nAnd yet the full breadth of lesbianism isn\u2019t that much less of a cultural mystery \u2014 nor is it much less derided and disbelieved \u2014 than it was in 1997, when Kevin Smith\u2019s cult classic awkwardly attempted to depict a subculture that few people outside of it care to understand.\nView this image \u203a\nCarmen Lee and Joey Lauren Adams Miramax / Courtesy Everett Collection\nID: 10910659 After Smith finished his first draft of the Chasing Amy script, he showed it to Guinevere Turner, the screenwriter and actor behind Go Fish: a mega-low budget indie about a group of lesbian friends directed and co-written by Rose Troche, which remains a pivotal work in lesbian cinema. Turner and Smith met at Sundance in 1994, the year both Go Fish and Smith\u2019s first View Askewniverse film, Clerks , were screening there.\n\u201cShe was the person I\u2019d show pages to, because I was shooting in the fuckin\u2019 dark,\u201d Smith told me. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about being a lesbian, the sexual practices of a lesbian. And mind you, this is pre-internet \u2014 so I didn\u2019t even have, like, fuckin\u2019 rudimentary porn to look at and shit like that, to be like, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s what they do.\u2019\u201d\nView this image \u203a\nGuinevere Turner and VS Brodie in Go Fish , 1994. Moviestore / REX / Shutterstock\nID: 10910020 But before Turner saw the script, Smith says, she partially inspired it. At Sundance, Smith and his producing partner Scott Mosier spent a lot of time hanging out with Turner and Troche.\n\u201cAs far as we knew, they were the first lesbians we\u2019d ever met in our lives,\u201d said Smith.\nAfter the festival ended, Mosier kept in touch with Turner \u2014 and, according to Smith, developed a bit of a crush. \u201cI\u2019d say to Scott, \u2018You\u2019re falling in love with this girl,\u2019\u201d Smith remembers. Both Smith and Mosier relayed this piece of Chasing Amy \u2019s origin story in an episode of their SModcast show in 2009, \u201cGlazing Amy.\u201d During the episode, which doubled as a new commentary track for Chasing Amy 12 years after its release, Smith jokes about Mosier attempting to convince Turner to date him despite her lesbianism: \u201cI\u2019ve got an asshole, it\u2019s kind of like a pussy!\u201d\nAt the time, Smith told Mosier to convert his heartache into content and make a movie about a guy who falls in love with a lesbian. But Mosier didn\u2019t think there was enough there, so Smith decided to take on the storyline himself, even though he \u201cdidn\u2019t really know that much about gay culture, and specifically lesbian culture,\u201d he says in \u201cGlazing Amy.\u201d\nOver the phone, Turner told me that after Chasing Amy was released, rumors were swirling that her role in inspiring the script went way further than an unrequited crush: \u201c\u2018You had sex with Scott Mosier!\u2019 \u2018You had sex with Kevin Smith!\u2019\u201d she remembers. \u201cN on both counts.\u201d\n\u201cLesbians are gonna haaaate this movie. This is a woman who\u2019s been a lesbian her whole life, and stops being a lesbian to be with a man. They\u2019re going to crucify it.\u201d\nID: 10910684 Turner remembers that Smith asked her to read his first draft \u201cwith lesbian eyeballs.\u201d She said she pointed out a part in the script where Smith \u201chad a thing about tongue fucking. And I was like, \u2018You have a tongue, you know what a vagina is like. You can\u2019t fuck someone with a tongue. Lesbians aren\u2019t given extra inches on their tongues.\u2019\u201d But other than that, Turner says she wasn\u2019t involved, besides finding Smith the setting for a lesbian bar scene (in which she has a cameo): the since-closed Meow Mix in downtown Manhattan, which was owned by one of her best friends at the time.\n\u201cI thought it was funny, outside of the lesbian content,\u201d Turner said. \u201cI loved the friendship between two guys.\u201d She noted the undercurrent of \u201cweird homo stuff\u201d charging Holden\u2019s relationship with his repressed, bigoted, and seemingly closeted best friend, Jason Lee\u2019s Banky. \u201cThat kind of bromance hadn\u2019t really been invented yet.\u201d\nBut Turner also warned him: \u201cLesbians are gonna haaaate this movie. This is a woman who\u2019s been a lesbian her whole life, and stops being a lesbian to be with a man,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to crucify it.\u201d And there were plenty who did .\nView this image \u203a\nBen Affleck and Jason Lee, Chasing Amy , 1997 Miramax / Courtesy Everett Collection\nID: 10910359 After the film was released, however, Turner says the reception wasn\u2019t as cutthroat as she\u2019d expected. \u201cI was so wrong! A lot of lesbians I know really loved the movie. I remember being embarrassed, like I didn\u2019t know my own community.\u201d Queer women, of course, are not a monolith, just like any other group; there\u2019s no grand gay consensus on Chasing Amy \u2014 or any other film, for that matter.\nIn \u201cGlazing Amy,\u201d Smith pointed out the various scenes that had some angry lesbian viewers \u201cup my ass about this movie.\u201d Still, he adds during the commentary track, \u201cI\u2019m kinda proud of myself \u2026 I got pretty close. It still looks like obviously someone who\u2019s not a lesbian made this movie, but \u2026 My argument would be like, \u2018Hey, I\u2019m as gay as you! I\u2019m as gay as you for women. I love pussy too.\u2019\u201d\nWhen I asked whether Smith still feels like he identifies with lesbians \u2014 it\u2019s been eight years since he and Mosier recorded \u201cGlazing Amy\u201d \u2014 Smith paused to think. \u201cDo I identify with the lesbian community still? Absolutely. I doubt that many of them identify with me.\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019ve never really identified with, like, dudes,\u201d he adds. \u201cI don\u2019t know how else to put it. I\u2019ve always been more comfortable around women. And not like they get me better \u2014 not at all. I\u2019m a pretty effeminate dude, to be honest with you, and I have been most of my life. I think that comes from being raised primarily by my mom \u2026 And I like to think that I\u2019m kind of enlightened.\u201d\n\u201cDo I identify with the lesbian community still? Absolutely. I doubt that many of them identify with me.\u201d\nID: 10910692 At the time he made Chasing Amy , \u201ca lot of dudes were very much like, \u2018Ew, gay dudes!\u2019 \u2014 shit like that \u2014 and I had the benefit of being brighter than that,\u201d he said. Smith says that in addition to basing the script on Mosier\u2019s unrequited crush, he made Chasing Amy for his older brother, who is gay and whom he considers a personal hero. Smith \u201chated thinking about my poor brother\u201d going to see movies that didn\u2019t speak to his personal experience, so now, in his films, \u201cI\u2019m always gonna whip a little gay content in there for my brother.\u201d He mentioned the homoerotica that runs through his other films, like Clerks , which is about \u201cdudes who love each other and just don\u2019t fuck. It\u2019s almost gay cinema, as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d\nOf gay people, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll always feel a kindred spirit of sorts. I guess being an outsider has something to do with it too. I\u2019ve never really been part of the mainstream, and neither has the gay community. But, you know, I\u2019d be embarrassing myself and everybody I know if I was sitting here being like, \u2018Oh yeah, I can identify with the lesbian experience.\u2019 I mean, I more identify with being a lady than being a lesbian. But I do like ladies, and ladies who like ladies are lesbians, so I guess you can find logic there.\u201d\nID: 10910145 Even though Smith\u2019s brother inspired him to take on a gay storyline, and Scott Mosier\u2019s crush on Guinevere Turner formed Chasing Amy \u2019s general premise, Smith says most of the film was based on Smith\u2019s relationship with Joey Lauren Adams. He and Adams, who stars as Alyssa, were dating at the time they were making the film. As a bearded, New Jersey\u2013dwelling hockey and comic book fan, Holden\u2019s an easy stand-in for Kevin Smith himself. \u201cWatching this film, the viewer can find me in every nook and cranny,\u201d Smith wrote for a post on the Criterion Collection\u2019s website in 2000. \u201cThe character of Holden is the closest to me I\u2019ve ever written (casting Ben was aesthetically wishful thinking perhaps).\u201d\nView this image \u203a\nKevin Smith and Joey Lauren Adams at the Chasing Amy Premiere in Los Angeles. Jeff Kravitz / FilmMagic, Inc\nID: 10910181 Ben, as in Affleck, plays a character who is what plenty of sexually frustrated, geeky teen boys dream of growing up to be: a modestly successful comic book writer who lives and works with his best friend from high school. (His ability to convince a lesbian to sleep with him is just icing on the fantastical cake.)\nThough Adams isn\u2019t gay, Smith told me that he spent their relationship grappling with Adams\u2019 past. Compared to him, Adams \u201chad lived a very big life\u201d and \u201chad lots of experience.\u201d\n\u201cAnd that sounds weird \u2014 I don\u2019t want to say lots of experience like, \u2018Oh my god, she slept with a bunch of people,\u2019\u201d he clarified. \u201cShe was fuckin\u2019 worldly. I\u2019m not just talking about sex, I\u2019m talking about \u2014 she lived in Bali . The weirdest, most important thing that ever happened to me was Clerks , and it was over. This was a person who had actually lived a fuckin\u2019 life. So she was intimidating, to say the least.\u201d\nHe decided to make a movie about their relationship, but didn\u2019t want the plot to be \u201ca fat kid dating an actress.\u201d He combined Mosier\u2019s story of unrequited love with his own, and Chasing Amy was born.\n\u201cThe script is really one big apology to Joey Adams, because I was such a jealous prick,\u201d Smith said. \u201cMaking Chasing Amy \u2026 saved me from being that guy for the rest of my life.\u201d\nAlthough Smith wrote the script mostly based on his own experiences, Chasing Amy does raise some interesting questions about gay politics \u2014 even if those questions felt a little fresher 20 years ago than they do now.\nDuring one scene set in a record store, Holden is stressing out about his second major blowout fight with Alyssa, after he discovers that he wasn\u2019t the first man she\u2019d ever slept with. Being told over and over and over again that he had no chance with his lesbian friend wasn\u2019t enough to deter him from aggressively pursuing her \u2014 but after finally getting the girl, learning that she once had a threesome with some guys in high school has him running for the hills.\nWhile they\u2019re shopping for records, Holden\u2019s friend Hooper (Dwight Ewell), a gay black comic who feigns butchness in public appearances to sell his work, warns Holden not to fall for the new trend of \u201clesbian chic.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s oh-so-acceptable to be a gay girl nowadays,\u201d Hooper sighs. \u201cPeople think it\u2019s cute. Got this fool picture of lipstick lesbians in their heads, like they all resemble Alyssa, while most of \u2019em look more like you. Gay or straight, ugly\u2019s still ugly. And most of those boys are scary \u2026 Screw that all-for-one shit, all right? I gotta deal with being in the minority of the minority, and nobody\u2019s supporting my ass.\u201d\nView this image \u203a\nDwight Ewell, Ben Affleck and Jason Lee, Chasing Amy , 1997. Miramax / Courtesy Everett Collection\nID: 10910240 It\u2019s a provocative exploration of queer infighting \u2014 as pervasive 20 years ago as it is today. Hooper assumes that feminine lesbians have it so easy because they\u2019re now desired by mainstream (male) culture; he doesn\u2019t consider that femme queer women sit at the intersection of sexism and homophobia. Butch dykes, meanwhile, are \u201cugly,\u201d so apparently unworthy of concern. Hooper\u2019s point about the struggles of being a minority within a minority is a powerful one, but it doesn\u2019t acknowledge that queer women of color \u2014 who are triply marginalized \u2014 exist at all.\nThe other major scene that explores an aspect of queer culture involves a conversation Alyssa has with her lesbian friends soon after her rain makeout with Holden, when they\u2019re all hanging out in a New York apartment. After some goading, Alyssa tells them she\u2019s fallen in love, before admitting that her new partner is a man. The women are deeply disappointed. \u201cAnother one bites the dust,\u201d one friend says, draining her wine.\nThe scene recalls a similar one in Go Fish, involving a group of lesbians ganging up on a woman who slept with a man and debating whether she still has the right to call herself a lesbian. \u201cWe got so much pushback for Go Fish for that scene \u2014 not when it came out, but when we were shooting it,\u201d Turner remembers.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not rocket science. But apparently it was to him \u2014 no offense, Kevin.\u201d\nID: 10910874 Some lesbians have certainly undergone identity crises and even suffered friend group fallouts for starting to date men, while some bisexual women have felt ostracized from lesbian spaces for the exact same reason. But even though Alyssa\u2019s storyline is perfectly believable \u2014 some self-identified lesbians have slept with men, and some have gotten unwarranted shit for it \u2014 it depicts a very limited slice of queer experience, and casts all lesbians as sour and one-dimensional man-haters. While Go Fish dedicates one scene to exploring what happens to lesbians and their communities when men get involved, that issue is Chasing Amy \u2019s entire premise.\nIn the \u201990s, Kevin Smith was well aware that some critics knocked him for depicting lesbians in this limited way. \u201cI think I found [those critiques] valid then, as well. But there\u2019s nothing I could do,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s not like, Well, the next movie I make about a guy who falls in love with a lesbian will be a lot better! But I understand them, absolutely \u2014 and believe me, the ones I didn\u2019t understand Guin explained to me very patiently back in the day.\u201d\n\u201cI like that in his memory I\u2019m the Yoda of lesbian culture,\u201d Turner told me, laughing. She doesn\u2019t remember explaining specific critiques to him, \u201cbut of course I would have. It\u2019s not rocket science. But apparently it was to him \u2014 no offense, Kevin.\u201d\nView this image \u203a\nAffleck, Adams and Lee, Chasing Amy , 1997. Miramax / Courtesy Everett Collection\nID: 10910276 Chasing Amy \u2019s most memorable scene is its climax. Holden decides that the only way to get over his feelings of inadequacy regarding Alyssa\u2019s sexual past is to sit her down with his best friend Banky, who has spent most of Chasing Amy berating Holden for dating a \u201cfucking dyke\u201d who\u2019s just going to leave him. Holden calmly requests that they all have a threesome together.\nThis is an entirely reasonable request, he figures, because Banky is clearly in love with him (why else has he been so obsessive and homophobic?) and this would be an opportunity for Holden and Alyssa to go somewhere sexually adventurous together, evening the playing field.\n\u201cYou know I need this,\u201d Holden wheedles. \u201cThis should be no big deal for you.\u201d Alyssa, looking stricken, says that time in her life has passed, and she found what she was looking for all along in Holden \u2014 something she apparently couldn\u2019t find throughout years and years of loving women.\nView this image \u203a\nDirector Kevin Smith and Ben Affleck on the set of Chasing Amy , 1997. Miramax / Courtesy Everett Collection\nID: 10910305 It\u2019s the kind of request that might warrant a takedown from the most controversial character on The L Word , the Showtime series centered on a group of lesbian friends in West Hollywood. As Jenny Schecter once said , \u201cIt\u2019s not a fucking woman\u2019s job to be consumed and invaded and spat out so that some fucking man can evolve.\u201d\nAlyssa offers a takedown of her own. \u201cI love you, I always will. Know that,\u201d she says, standing up to hug him. Then she hits him full across the face. \u201cBut I\u2019m not your fucking whore.\u201d\nA year later, Alyssa has a new girlfriend, and Holden is pretty much empty-handed. But he does have his new comic, Chasing Amy , based on his relationship with Alyssa, which he shows to her when they run into each other at another comic con in New York. They\u2019ve reached a kind of peace.\nSmith said that after the film was released, viewers would ask if he thought the two ended up together. As \u201ca twentysomething shithead,\u201d he\u2019d tell them: \u201cA dreamer feels they will; a realist knows they won\u2019t.\u201d\n\u201cTo me, it was about a boy who grows up to become a man but loses everything in the process.\u201d\nID: 10910715 Early on, Alyssa makes clear that she\u2019s \u201cnot a man-hater or something like that. It\u2019s just been some time that [she\u2019s] been exposed to a man\u201d who didn\u2019t live up to a \u201cstereotype of some sort.\u201d Here, the film kills two birds with one stone: Alyssa is depicted as a desirably cool, reasonable lesbian, not one of those scary, man-hating dykes; meanwhile, Holden exists beyond stereotypes, special enough to temporarily save her from the gay dark side. Their eventual breakup is mostly attributed to differences in experiences and lifestyle \u2014 but until the very end, Alyssa still says she loves Holden and \u201calways will.\u201d\n\u201cFor anyone who watches the movie now and goes, like, \u2018Ew, these sexual politics are \u2026 not very subtle\u2019, you\u2019ve gotta remember: It was made by a 26-year-old, 27-year-old guy, who really didn\u2019t know anything and was learning in that moment,\u201d Smith told me. \u201cAs much as it\u2019s a movie that\u2019s closely identified with the gay community, by virtue of the fact that the main character was gay, I really never think about it as such \u2026 To me, it was about a boy who grows up to become a man but loses everything in the process \u2014 very bittersweet.\u201d\n\u201cI can see why a new generation wouldn\u2019t be crazy about it,\u201d Turner said. \u201cSex and sexuality is so much more visible. There\u2019s a heck of a lot more out there, certainly more than there was 20 years ago.\u201d Chasing Amy , she said, \u201cisn\u2019t even a lesbian movie, but it has a lesbian in it with a complicated sexuality. That had literally never been done before in any movie anyone had ever seen.\u201d\nView this image \u203a\nAdams in a scene filmed inside of Meow Mix in NYC, 1997. Miramax / Courtesy Everett Collection\nID: 10910396 Twenty years after Chasing Amy \u2019s release, movies about lesbians aren\u2019t quite as rare, but are still few and far between \u2014 and like movies about basically everything else, they still tend to be directed by men. The biggest movies involving lesbian characters over the past decade have been rich, beautifully shot dramas by male auteurs, including Todd Haynes\u2019 much-beloved Carol and controversial foreign contenders like Abdellatif Kechiche\u2019s Blue Is the Warmest Color and Park Chan-wook\u2019s The Handmaiden . \u201cAm I personally dying for a big lesbian movie on the level of Carol or Blue Is the Warmest Color ?\u201d said Turner, when I asked about the future of lesbian movies. \u201cNo. I feel like that model is kind of outdated \u2014 we\u2019re better and smarter and more interesting than that.\u201d\nFrom Lisa Cholodenko\u2019s High Art (1998) to Dee Rees\u2019s Pariah (2011) to Desiree Akhavan\u2019s Appropriate Behavior (2014), queer indie filmmakers have been telling their own stories in gorgeous, funny, and heartbreaking ways for decades now \u2014 but as generational ideas about gender and sexuality constantly change, so, too, does the film industry.\n\u201cAll the women that I know \u2014 all the women making lesbian films in the \u201990s \u2014 we spent the rest of our careers proving we weren\u2019t just lesbian filmmakers,\u201d said Turner. And now, \u201ca new generation is like, \u2018What? Indie film? We have the internet, we have web series.\u2019 I think we\u2019re in a bit of a Wild West period here.\u201d\nTurner muses that \u201cno one knows what to do post\u2013 L Word ,\u201d which Turner worked on as a writer and guest actor. \u201cFor me personally, making new stuff, I obviously want lesbian representation, but I don\u2019t want to make the next lesbian show.\u201d (If someone gave her millions of dollars to make Lesbian James Bond , however, she definitely wouldn\u2019t say no.)\n\u201cTo me it has to be something more,\u201d she adds. \u201cTo me you can no longer talk about LGBT without really talking about everything happening across generations with identity \u2014 that tension and joy and discovery.\u201d\nTwo decades ago, Chasing Amy won praise and accolades as much as it incited ire and debate. Now some argue the sexual politics have actually aged quite well : Perhaps Chasing Amy was actually about bisexuality all along, and the limits of forcing people into binary boxes of attraction when the queer experience can oftentimes be more fluid, and more complicated, than that. Queer women are still fiercely debating the future of lesbian identity in an age when gender boundaries are crashing around us every day. Looking back, the \u201990s-era debates around Chasing Amy seem like small harbingers of the different sorts of queer conversations to come.\nIn 2017, the future of lesbian films seems just as shaky as the future of lesbian bars. Meow Mix, where Smith shot Chasing Amy \u2019s dancing scene, was one of the most popular lesbian bars in the \u201990s, but it shuttered in the mid-2000s like so many others . Turner remembers that a week or so before they shot the scene there, she brought Adams and some of her friends to Meow Mix to check the place out.\n\u201cThey were having a great time. And my friend was like, \u2018What is with the Jersey straight girls?\u2019 I was like, \u2018They\u2019re learning!\u2019\u201d Adams and her friends were observing lesbians \u201cin their natural habitat.\u201d It\u2019s a goofy image \u2014 but one that, strangely, isn\u2019t that hard to imagine happening now. A lot of people today still have only the vaguest notion about what it\u2019s like to be a lesbian. That\u2019s why Chasing Amy remains so memorable and so polarizing: its attempt to demystify a highly politicized and oft-maligned identity. For better or for worse. \u25cf\nCORRECTION\nRose Troche is the director of Go Fish.

Lorenzo Tanos \nEarlier this month, Dean Ambrose and Renee Young quietly got married, surprising thousands of WWE fans with their no-fanfare decision to tie the knot. However, the latest WWE rumors suggest all isn\u2019t well backstage for the \u201cLunatic Fringe,\u201d and possibly his longtime girlfriend-turned-new wife as well \u2014 it would seem that the couple has backstage heat with WWE\u2019s higher-ups, with Ambrose a particular target for criticism. \nOn Saturday, the Inquisitr wrote that Dean Ambrose and Renee Young\u2019s marriage may have been the reason for the fact that the couple now works for different brands . Based on longtime wrestling journalist Dave Meltzer\u2019s observations, WWE may have been unhappy with the surprise, no-fanfare wedding, hence Ambrose moving to Monday Night RAW via the recent Superstar Shake-Up. Young, on the other hand, remains on the SmackDown Live brand, where she continues to host Talking Smack on Tuesday nights. \nWith the exception of a few couples, such as John Cena and Nikki Bella and The Miz and Maryse, WWE has tended to place couples in separate brands whenever brand split rules apply. Aside from Dean Ambrose and Renee Young, whose marriage may have led to Ambrose getting traded, their fellow real-life couples Big Cass and Carmella, Zack Ryder and Emma, and Alberto Del Rio and Paige were all \u201csplit up\u201d in one way or another, with the male and female halves of the couple placed on different brands last year. The reasons are often unclear, as All Wrestling News observed, but there are enough examples of such to suggest that WWE chairman Vince McMahon generally dislikes it when men and women who work for him fall in love with each other while under his watch. \u201cThe Lunatic Fringe\u201d Dean Ambrose was relegated to the pre-show of \u2018WrestleMania 33\u2019 despite the fact he holds WWE\u2019s longest-running mid-card belt, the Intercontinental Championship. [Image by WWE] \nMoving on to Dean Ambrose in particular, WWE may be upset with him for a completely different set of reasons. There have been some whispers behind the scenes that WWE was recently unhappy with Ambrose for \u201cinappropriate behavior.\u201d While he still holds the Intercontinental Championship, his title match against Baron Corbin was moved to the WrestleMania 33 pre-show, and there have been some claims that backstage officials weren\u2019t happy to see him drunk during WWE\u2019s Hall of Fame induction ceremonies. \nWith mileage still varying as to whether Dean Ambrose and Renee Young\u2019s marriage got them backstage heat with WWE officials or not, new reports are suggesting that The Miz and Maryse\u2019s rundown of Ambrose on this week\u2019s Monday Night RAW was more than just a standard storyline segment. \nAccording to WhatCulture , this took place on the \u201cMiz TV\u201d talk show segment , as Miz ripped Dean for not looking and acting like WWE Superstars are expected to. However, the tone of the segment seemed to change when Miz began referencing how far Ambrose had fallen since he was WWE Champion and SmackDown Live \u2018s first pick in the WWE draft last year. This is in sharp contrast to where he stands right now, having recently seen his match with Baron Corbin get moved to the WrestleMania kickoff show. Were The Miz and Maryse speaking on WWE\u2019s behalf when they suggested Dean Ambrose may have become lazy and complacent? [Image by WWE] \nThe tone of those latter comments, according to Wrestling Observer Radio hosts Dave Meltzer and Bryan Alvarez, are usually a sign that WWE is speaking through its wrestlers, trying to send a real-life message to its talent through ostensibly scripted promos. As such, WhatCulture believes that there may be some truth to the Dean Ambrose (and possibly Renee Young) backstage heat rumors, with Ambrose\u2019s \u201clazy and complacent\u201d attitude not sitting well with WWE management. \nOn the other hand, there\u2019s a chance Ambrose\u2019s move to Monday Night RAW has a bigger reason behind it, and may not be related to his attitude. IWNerd wrote earlier this week that WWE is considering a Dean Ambrose heel turn , with the \u201cLunatic Fringe\u201d facing his former Shield associate Seth Rollins in a long-term feud. That may put the kibosh on rumors that WWE is planning a Shield reunion, now that Ambrose, Rollins, and Roman Reigns are on the same brand again, though fans remain hopeful that the \u201cHounds of Justice\u201d will reprise their hugely popular act and reunite at some point in the future. \nAlthough it might not be all good news for fans of Dean Ambrose, Renee Young doesn\u2019t appear to have been affected by any talk of backstage heat, as she remains a mainstay of both Talking Smack and the E! reality show Total Divas , the latter of which has often shed some light on her real-life relationship with Ambrose. \n[Featured Image by WWE]"}, {"crawled": "2017-04-19T23:37:44.000+03:00", "title": "FOX News Just Canned Bill O'Reilly", "external_links": [], "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "eec4b1349c12152f98322a898c384a76f8853975", "author": "Drew Schwartz", "thread": {"section_title": "vice", "title": "FOX News Just Canned Bill O'Reilly", "site_full": "www.vice.com", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 950, "likes": 950}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "title_full": "FOX News Just Canned Bill O'Reilly - Vice", "site_type": "news", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT7LPYakljWjybzhtyDBPCDvM0EY0oN8QEFlBaG0_PLgzzZmKp94nlvDxGJ2H8VYedJP1_Ohbvpjr.g1wVuIfiM", "uuid": "eec4b1349c12152f98322a898c384a76f8853975", "participants_count": 1, "replies_count": 0, "domain_rank": 173, "spam_score": 0.0, "country": "US", "site": "vice.com", "main_image": "https://video-images.vice.com/articles/58f7b228a1aac75262e74156/lede/1492632980382-GettyImages-664970502.jpeg?crop=0.7222xw:0.6086xh;0.2071xw,0.0126xh&resize=1200:*", "site_section": "http://www.vice.com/rss", "published": "2017-04-19T23:37:44.000+03:00", "performance_score": 9, "site_categories": []}, "highlightText": "", "rating": null, "ord_in_thread": 0, "entities": {"persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "bill o'reilly foxnewskickedbill o'reilly"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "bill o'reilly"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "drew schwartz"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "o'reilly"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "roger ailes"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "carlson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "fox"}], "locations": [], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "tucker carlson tonight"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "npr"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "fox news channel"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "new york times"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "21st century fox*"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "los angelestimes"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "times"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "fox"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT7LPYakljWjybzhtyDBPCDvM0EY0oN8QEFlBaG0_PLgzzZmKp94nlvDxGJ2H8VYedJP1_Ohbvpjr.g1wVuIfiM", "published": "2017-04-19T23:37:44.000+03:00", "text": "FOXNewskickedBill O'Reilly to the curbWednesday amid a sexual harassment scandal that lost his primetime show, The O'Reilly Factor , more than50 advertisers, the New York Times reports .\nIn earlyApril,O'Reilly found himself in the midst of a PR nightmare when the Times uncovered how much FOX's parent company, 21st Century Fox*, paid to settle several sexual harassment allegations against the host that date back to the early 2000s .The company dished out $13 million to keep fiveof his accusers quiet.Though FOXwas aware ofthe allegations, it wasn't until The O'Reilly Factor the mostwatched andmostprofitable cable news show on television began to loseadvertisers and face significant public opposition that the company decided topartways with its star host.\n\"After a thorough and careful review of the allegations, the company and Bill O'Reilly have agreed that Bill O'Reilly will not be returning to the Fox News Channel,\" 21st Century Fox wrote in a statement .\nThe company hired a team of lawyers to investigate the allegations made against O'Reilly, which the former host has denied.

Not to be deterred, now the studio is hoping they can recruit him onto the Aladdin remake to play the role that belonged to Robin Williams in the 1992 animated original: Genie. \nWill Smith is in early talks to play the Genie in this new Aladdin movie. Smith is the first actor to be rumored for this re-telling, and according to Deadline , the production is expected to begin in the United Kingdom this July and stretch into early next year, so that's why his name is popping up so early. However, keep in mind that there's emphasis on the early, so we'll have to wait over the coming weeks to find out whether or not the former Fresh Prince of Bel-Air will sign on the dotted line and get his magic on in Agrabah. \nWhether you love Disney's original Aladdin or it ranks lower on your list of animated favorites, most people will agree that Robin Williams' Genie stole the show with his humorous shenanigans, and in some scenes, Williams even ad-libbed most of his dialogue. While Will Smith doesn't have the same kind of comedic background as Williams did, he certainly has no shortage of the personality needed to play such a larger-than-life character. Not to mention that he's just the kind of star power a movie like this needs. \nJust like Disney's original Aladdin movie, the live action remake will be loosely based off the legend from The Book of One Thousand and One Nights and follow the eponymous protagonist as he discovers a magic lamp containing a genie who will grant him three wishes. Other notable players in this tale include Jasmine, Aladdin's princess love interest, and Jafar, the evil sorcerer who wants the genie's power for himself. The new Aladdin movie will also remain a musical . King Arthur: Legend of the Sword 's Guy Ritchie is handling directing duties, while John August, who wrote the Charlie's Angels movie, penned the script. \nIt's also worth noting that more than a year before Disney announced they were making a traditional live action Aladdin remake, there was also word about a prequel called Genies being developed that would lead into the main movie. Whether that particular project is still being worked on, let alone if Will Smith would be involved with it, is unclear, although if production on Aladdin is only a couple months away from beginning, it seems unlikely. \nWhat do you think of Will Smith potentially playing Genie in the new Aladdin movie?

Marlene King 's new series, Famous in Love , could be it.\nThe new Freeform show, which premieres Tuesday (April 18) and can be binged via digital platforms after the pilot, follows naive Paige Townsen ( Bella Thorne ), who auditions for the movie Locked and ends up nabbing the lead female role. She quickly gets caught up in the craziness of Hollywood while trying to balance work and school, and also striving to keep her feelings for costar Rainer Devon ( Carter Jenkins ) in check.\nThe show is adapted from Rebecca Serle's YA series \u2014 a third novel of which is reportedly in the works \u2014 and as with all book-to-TV series, there are some major changes from page to screen.\nPaige is older and already in L.A. Eric McCandless/Freeform Though she's a 17-year-old in Portland in the books, the show gives us a 20-year-old Paige who lives with BFFs Cassandra \"Cassie\" Perkins ( Georgie Flores ) and Jake Salt ( Charlie DePew ) in an L.A. apartment I have zero idea how they can afford. She's also studying economics in college, and gets dragged to the audition by Cassie instead of going by herself like she does in the first book.\nPaige\u2019s family life is barely referenced. Eric McCandless/Freeform In the series' first novel, Paige is the youngest of four children, including a sister with whom drama later unfolds. But her parents don't live with her on the show, and only visit her sparingly. Paige's dad is more supportive of her acting career in the book, while her mom isn't exactly sold on the idea. On the show, their views are reversed.\nLocked is not filmed in Hawaii. Eric McCandless/Freeform The first book sets a major amount of action in Hawaii, but the show opts to film the movie on a famous Hollywood soundstage instead, where Jordan Wilder ( Keith Powers ) is cast at the same time as everyone else \u2014 unlike in the book, when he shows up about midway through.\nRainer and Jordan\u2019s feud doesn\u2019t last long. Eric McCandless/Freeform The feud between the bros is a major plot point in the books, but the battle is resolved shockingly fast on the show. They're fighting for a different reason, too.\nThe love triangle is vastly different. Eric McCandless/Freeform Will Paige choose Rainer or Jordan? That's the main question in the books, but don't expect the same relationships to develop on the show. Paige still crushes on Rainer, but in her love life, Jordan's been swapped with someone else.\nRainer\u2019s mom plays a huge role. Mitch Haaseth/Freeform Despite having, like, one scene in the books, Nina Devon ( Perrey Reeves ) is a major player in the TV adaptation, producing the film Locked instead of Rainer's dad (who's not around for a big reason).\nJordan\u2019s past is even darker. Eric McCandless/Freeform Jordan's fight with his abusive father in the book series was caused by his perceived need to protect his mother and sister. On the show, however, his father is nowhere to be found, but his family life is much worse.\nCassie and Jake don\u2019t date. Mitch Haaseth/Freeform A huge ordeal for Paige in the first book is when her besties become a couple. But the show opts for the duo to be just good friends instead, without even a hint of a spark between them.\nBut the two play much bigger roles. Byron Cohen/Freeform We only got glimpses of Paige's friends in the books when she visited Portland or called Cassie. But her BFFs are major players on the show, with Cassie hiding a dark secret and Jake trying to make it as a filmmaker.\nAlexis Glenn is not Paige\u2019s friend. Eric McCandless/Freeform In Serle's second book, Paige befriends Alexis, who plays her character's sister in the Locked films. But TV Alexis ( Niki Koss ) is front and center of the drama, doing everything she can to make Paige's life miserable.\nSay hello to a new character: Tangey Turner. Byron Cohen/Freeform Tangey ( Pepi Sonuga ) is a popular musician who joins Locked , sharing a complicated history with both Rainer and Jordan."}, {"crawled": "2017-04-19T08:41:59.000+03:00", "title": "Riz Ahmed Joins Joaquin Phoenix in \u2018The Sisters Brothers\u2019 | Variety", "external_links": [], "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "d5a6026c89d98ab66339d1fb546802d4422de2ff", "author": "Justin Kroll", "thread": {"section_title": "", "title": "Riz Ahmed Joins Joaquin Phoenix in \u2018The Sisters Brothers\u2019 | Variety", "site_full": "variety.com", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 7}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 949, "likes": 949}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "title_full": "Riz Ahmed Joins Joaquin Phoenix in \u2018The Sisters Brothers\u2019 | Variety", "site_type": "news", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMvMj85Ki6mu3UljQu8_.CT5el0VNHM8l8GhxMcHk0Euep_dQjRs8dMVFTsUV0zVT4GcM9ycGHkuFj4On6aNKrC8ZzB6ln.5AglUrGUXPoqG_L7ArWP4MQfdGBlybI7CHJum_PLWWDLnWacAYeFBMjuQEBh13uwxGTDA3wvU_O5ypw--", "uuid": "d5a6026c89d98ab66339d1fb546802d4422de2ff", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "domain_rank": 1644, "spam_score": 0.165, "country": "US", "site": "variety.com", "main_image": "https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/riz-ahmed-headshot.jpg?w=1000&amp;h=671&amp;crop=1", "site_section": "", "published": "2017-04-19T00:52:00.000+03:00", "performance_score": 9, "site_categories": []}, "highlightText": "", "rating": null, "ord_in_thread": 0, "entities": {"persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "joh"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "riz ahmed joins joaquin phoenix"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "riz ahmed"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "joaquin phoenix"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "sam jones"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "gordon"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ahmed"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "jason bourne"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "eli"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "jacques audiard"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "matt damon"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "charlie sisters"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "c. reilly"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "reilly"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kate bryden"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "patrick dewitt"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "audiard"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "stephen leacock"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "michael de luca"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "jake gyllenhaal"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "alison dickey"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "john c. reilly"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "oregon"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "u.k."}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "netflix"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "caa"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "hbo"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cannes film festival"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/vkc1Z8ITDMvMj85Ki6mu3UljQu8_.CT5el0VNHM8l8GhxMcHk0Euep_dQjRs8dMVFTsUV0zVT4GcM9ycGHkuFj4On6aNKrC8ZzB6ln.5AglUrGUXPoqG_L7ArWP4MQfdGBlybI7CHJum_PLWWDLnWacAYeFBMjuQEBh13uwxGTDA3wvU_O5ypw--", "published": "2017-04-19T00:52:00.000+03:00", "text": "Sam Jones April 18, 2017 | 09:52AM PT \n\u201cThe Night Of\u201d star Riz Ahmed has joined Joaquin Phoenix, John C.

April 18 2017 5:30 AM The Retail Apocalypse Is Suburban Cities will weather this concentrated economic downturn because they went through it 50 years ago. Their neighbors may not be so lucky. A man walks past empty stores in the deserted Carousel shopping mall in San Bernardino, California, Sept. 11, 2012. Lucy Nicholson/Reuters \nOne by one, the problems that America has long dismissed as \u201curban\u201d have marched into the suburbs: crime, poverty, hunger, deindustrialization, drug addiction, civil unrest. The dissolution of community institutions. An aging stock of unwanted houses. Henry Grabar \nHenry Grabar is a staff writer for Slate \u2019s Moneybox. \nTo which we can add: the decline of retail. It has been a decade since the media declared the death of the mall, in a year that would be the first in a half-century that no new malls were built in America. It has since become apparent that the problem is a little bigger than that: Brick-and-mortar retail in general is gasping for breath. The Limited, a women\u2019s clothing store, shut down 250 stores and laid off 4,000 workers earlier this year. Sears Holdings will close 150 stores, including 108 Kmarts, and Macy\u2019s will close another 100. As anchor stores close, more and more malls are entering foreclosure. Financial instruments composed of debt from mall deals are looking as risky as their counterparts in residential debt did before the housing crisis. Advertisement \nSeveral months of job losses in certain retail categories\u2014at a time when the economy is otherwise healthy\u2014have sounded the alarm for the transition that economists have long feared from the rise of e-commerce in general and Amazon in particular. \nTechnological change spurred by new infrastructure and some favorable tax policies have radically changed the way Americans shop, and communities built around old-style shopping will find themselves saddled with obsolete structures. That sounds like news. But it\u2019s exactly the way you could describe the decline of urban retail that seized the American downtown in the second half of the 20 th century and never let go. To some extent, cities are well-positioned to weather the current shift, since the jobs that look vulnerable right now left for the suburbs years ago. Get Slate in your inbox. \nAnd maybe suburbs, where the current wave of job loss will be concentrated, could learn something from how cities managed (or failed to manage) that decline. \nIn the post-war era, as cities battled population flight and a declining tax base, city planners came to see downtown commerce as an essential component of the urban revival. Department-store magnates had long played a major civic role, sponsoring parades and directing local policy, and they made their preferences\u2014like plentiful off-street parking, slum clearance, improvements in highways and transit, and modern shopping centers\u2014those of the city. The retail sectors in which recent job loss is concentrated belong largely to American suburbs. Advertisement \nIt didn\u2019t work. Suburban shopping centers maintained essential advantages. The tax burden in brand-new, well-off suburbs was low. Federal policy gave better write-offs to new construction than renovation. In a misguided attempt to revive downtown retail, city planners demolished the blocks of family-owned businesses that had anchored it. The memory of a downtown department store became a generational marking point. \nIt was the beginning of a fight over the geography of retail that has never ended. Cities sued suburbs over new malls; suburbs battled each other with offers of prime land and tax breaks. In the 1980s, New Haven, Connecticut\u2014desperate to stop the construction of a 1.1 million square foot mall in the suburb of North Haven\u2014 filed four lawsuits over highway widening and wetlands protection, among other subjects. The battle went on for most of the decade, and the mall was never built. Then, in 1999, the city tried to build a 1.5 million\u2013square-foot mall but ran into opposition funded by the company Westfield, which operated malls in three nearby suburbs. \nThe retail sectors in which recent job loss is concentrated belong largely to American suburbs. Seventy-one percent of workers in sales and related occupations live in the suburbs, according to the Brookings Institution, about 2 percentage points higher than the average for U.S. workers. \nLeading the pack are department stores; general merchandise stores; and sporting goods, hobby, book, and music stores. Each of those categories has lost jobs for five straight months, dating to November. Clothing stores, after experiencing a big holiday spike, have lost jobs for two straight months. Advertisement \nIn other words, it\u2019s exactly the industries you\u2019d expect to be hit hard by the rise in e-commerce, and as the Houston Chronicle \u2019s Lydia DePillis succinctly shows , a much larger, longer trend is in skyrocketing warehouse employment. (How those jobs compare to traditional retail jobs in quantity and quality is a question for another day.) Retail sectors with less developed online analogues\u2014like grocery stores, gas stations, and car dealers\u2014are chugging along just fine. \nUrban commercial corridors have a few advantages here. First, while the blight of a vacant storefront can be contagious and damaging, the ownership structure of an urban corridor is more forgiving than that of a mall, where a few vacancies could tip the balance sheet of the whole entity into the red. Second, the typical mix of an urban retail corridor\u2014with stores flanked by restaurants, bars, and other entertainment attractions\u2014ought to be more resilient than old-fashioned malls. Indeed, posh, successful \u201ctown center\u201d malls have learned from developments like Baltimore\u2019s Harborplace and strive to differentiate themselves. The Grove, in Los Angeles, one of the world\u2019s most successful malls, has a literal trolley running down its main \u201cstreet.\u201d Third, mixed-use and transit-oriented development keeps people (including tourists) in close contact with retail. \nWhat stands out from the last time all this happened is this: Major American cities threw everything at retaining center-city retail, and they still basically failed. \nAs shopping centers fold, developers of would-be projects will gain more power relative to suburban municipalities that already compete tooth-and-nail to steal each other\u2019s business. (In the St. Louis area\u2014where 88 percent of low-wage workers, a category whose biggest proportion is retail, live in the suburbs\u2014local governments have spent $5.8 billion in public money over the past 20 years to compete for development.) Top Comment \nWriters keep blaming e-Commerce for the demise of the brick-and-mortar retail sector in the US. But there is a simpler reason. US Retail grossly overbuilt -- creating a retail space bubble. More... Join In \nHoles left by declining sales and property-tax revenues will make suburban jurisdictions desperate for new development, and they\u2014like cities before them\u2014will make bad decisions in an effort to revive their retail centers, which now carry much the same civic symbolism, and inspire the same strong memories, as downtown retail did for cities. \nAnd if there\u2019s a lesson from the cities, it\u2019s that the broader systems changing how people shop cannot be overturned with tax breaks for new developments. The sooner they begin to think of alternate ways to create community and jobs\u2014and to reuse and rebuild the vacated space of the mall\u2014the better off they\u2019ll be.

And in addition to being super futuristic-looking, it also has some fairly surprising specs.\nThe E-tron Sportback will have 320 kilowatts of power \u2014 though Audi promises a \u201cboost mode\u201d to 370 kW \u2014 and can sprint to 62 mph in 4.5 seconds. A 95 kWh battery pack will enable just over 310 miles of range per charge, although that will probably be closer to 275 miles, given that the Germany-based Audi uses the European rating system for electric vehicle range. The automaker says the new electric coupe crossover will hit the market in 2019, about a year after the Quattro E-tron , Audi\u2019s first electric concept which it introduced back in 2015.\nThe Audi badge on the front of the car lights up, as if to say, \u201cHi, I\u2019m from the future.\u201d Light-up badges are all the rage these days, with both Mercedes-Benz and Infiniti offering vehicles with glowing logos on their grille. Some auto execs predict that headlights will soon be obsolete , not necessarily because of these illuminated badges, but rather because the cars will be driving themselves.\nThe interior of the E-tron Sportback features a bunch of pretty, high-resolution touchscreens: one behind the steering wheel, two in the center console, and a few more scattered around. Digitally controlled LEDs at the front and rear of the car produce \u201can excellent light yield,\u201d Audi says, while minuscule digital projectors \u201cliterally make their mark on the road ahead, turning light into a versatile, dynamic channel of communication with the surroundings.\u201d In other words, the Audi badge on the front of the car ain\u2019t the only thing that glows.\nAudi has said it intends to produce three electric vehicles; the E-tron Quattro and E-tron Sportback being the first two. The automaker also has plans to build a hydrogen-powered SUV dubbed the H-tron Quattro , which it unveiled last year. This suite of zero-emission concepts makes it pretty clear that Audi is doing its best to look beyond our fossil fuel-driven present \u2014 typified by the diesel-emissions scandal that has embroiled its parent company, Volkswagen \u2014 and toward a cleaner, more sustainable future.\nGrid View"}, {"crawled": "2017-04-19T22:33:27.000+03:00", "title": "'Deadpool 2': Leslie Uggams Returning as Blind Al", "external_links": [], "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "ed97be1e84b3e5803fc3914125f6cb74fb7345f4", "author": "", "thread": {"section_title": "Movies", "title": "'Deadpool 2': Leslie Uggams Returning as Blind Al", "site_full": "www.hollywoodreporter.com", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 945, "likes": 945}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "title_full": "'Deadpool 2': Leslie Uggams Returning as Blind Al", "site_type": "news", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9xeYQi1zghmmJA2_CrkiMRZ73YbFtTj8zAcaPMInJUN5RjgrpIP3JbEPVLEmm8nv_CkGF85yJ4akwsLZ_lY3BShi0KLIJnuVYkKuTJmx3dzQJwuxIm6uq04ZuJN8xTwQ0-", "uuid": "ed97be1e84b3e5803fc3914125f6cb74fb7345f4", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "domain_rank": 1268, "spam_score": 0.0, "country": "US", "site": "hollywoodreporter.com", "main_image": "http://cdn4.thr.com/sites/default/files/2017/04/deadpool_still_ryan_reynolds_and_leslie-uggams_-_publicity_-_h_2017.jpg", "site_section": "http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/taxonomy/term/194/all/feed", "published": "2017-04-19T22:33:27.000+03:00", "performance_score": 9, "site_categories": []}, "highlightText": "", "rating": null, "ord_in_thread": 0, "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9xeYQi1zghmmJA2_CrkiMRZ73YbFtTj8zAcaPMInJUN5RjgrpIP3JbEPVLEmm8nv_CkGF85yJ4akwsLZ_lY3BShi0KLIJnuVYkKuTJmx3dzQJwuxIm6uq04ZuJN8xTwQ0-", "published": "2017-04-19T22:33:27.000+03:00", "text": "The scene-stealing actress is ready to take on Ryan Reynolds once more. \nLeslie Uggams is coming back for round two. \nThe actress will reprise her role as Blind Al in Deadpool 2 , Heat Vision has confirmed.

At one point during the \u201ctroll storm\u201d campaign, she said she came home to a dark house, her husband waiting inside with the bags packed. \u201cWe really thought we had to run for safety in the middle of the night,\u201d Gersh said. \nSince the first post on December 16, according to the lawsuit, he has published 30 posts calling for actions against Gersh. \u201cThis was really terrorism,\u201d Gersh said Tuesday. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get teased, we got terrorized.\u201d \nAccording to court records, Anglin has not responded yet to the lawsuit. One of Gersh\u2019s attorneys, Richard Cohen, the legal director at the Southern Poverty Law Center, told BuzzFeed News on Wednesday that they haven\u2019t served Anglin with the suit yet. Anglin is a resident of Ohio, but reportedly could be residing in the Philippines or somewhere in Europe. \nWhen he does respond, legal experts expect Anglin will raise some sort of First Amendment defense. However, in order to win in court, he will have to prove to a jury that the speech he engaged in was not intended to cause harm. \n\u201cSpeech that a reasonable person would construe as harm, that\u2019s not protected. In our system, you can hold discriminatory views, you can\u2019t act on them,\u201d David Schulz, a partner at Levine, Sullivan, Koch, Schulz, who has 35 years of First Amendment litigation experience. \n\u201cIf [Anglin] can say, I\u2019m just expressing an opinion and try to pull this into the sphere of free speech, it gets back to what a reasonable person would understand as protected speech\u201d Schulz says. \nTo prove that he was just expressing his opinion, Anglin might argue that he was merely republishing Sherry Spencer\u2019s Medium blog post in which she accuses Gersh of attempting to extort her as part of a real estate deal to sell off a piece of property in Whitefish, Montana. \nIn November 2016, according to the lawsuit, Gersh reached out to Sherry Spencer about a planned protest outside a building that Spencer owns in downtown Whitefish. Gersh claims that she informed Sherry Spencer about the demonstrations, which were being planned in response to a viral video of her son, Richard, leading a \u201cHail Trump!\u201d chant, and offered to help Spencer sell the building. According to the lawsuit, Gersh and Sherry Spencer began to discuss working together to sell the property. But then a month later, Sherry Spencer apparently had a change of heart, and published the Medium post accusing Gersh of extortion. \nMontana Law School Professor Eduardo Capulong points out that if Anglin could prove that he was merely commenting on this purported feud between the Spencers and Gersh, he would be protected. \u201cBut using it as basis to attack without verifying is reckless,\u201d he added. \n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing, if Anglin said: Oh, look at this blog post, and fuck them. That\u2019s arguably protected by free speech,\u201d Capulong said. \u201cBut then, you go beyond that and say: target this family.\u201d \nAsked if Anglin\u2019s calls for his readers not to be violent would protect him, Capulong said, \u201cI don\u2019t think so. Given everything that he was doing, and invoking Nazi ideology, images, I think any reasonable person would see that as a call to violence.\u201d "}, {"crawled": "2017-04-19T06:17:16.000+03:00", "title": "Aisha Hinds Joins Legendary\u2019s \u2018Godzilla: King Of The Monsters\u2019 | Deadline", "external_links": [], "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "973617e1ed89d95cfb055737a27ce17a48878926", "author": "Amanda N'Duka", "thread": {"section_title": "", "title": "Aisha Hinds Joins Legendary\u2019s \u2018Godzilla: King Of The Monsters\u2019 | Deadline", "site_full": "deadline.com", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 3}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 943, "likes": 943}, "vk": {"shares": 5}}, "title_full": "Aisha Hinds Joins Legendary\u2019s \u2018Godzilla: King Of The Monsters\u2019 | Deadline", "site_type": "news", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Udv9x6MIntCZn9jXYv3iF84GMtAagtPOE0ZQEO6VR6Scq2KRP.dCBEboMewXWcgf0fRMtN_TsfnacPiVhTtqU8PDP4ah6SO9GHYnQsq.S_2MPQAxKLsrizS", "uuid": "973617e1ed89d95cfb055737a27ce17a48878926", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "domain_rank": 3087, "spam_score": 0.197, "country": "US", "site": "deadline.com", "main_image": "https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/image2.jpg?w=605", "site_section": "", "published": "2017-04-19T01:49:00.000+03:00", "performance_score": 9, "site_categories": []}, "highlightText": "", "rating": null, "ord_in_thread": 0, "entities": {"persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "aisha hinds"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "ashley nguyen"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "jeff bernstein"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "harriet tubman"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "millie bobby brown"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "bryan cranston"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "o\u2019shea jackson jr."}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dougherty"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "fox"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "vera farmiga"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "hinds"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kyle chandler"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ken watanabe"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "anthony mackie"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "michael dougherty"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kong"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "zach shields"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "skull island"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "deadline warner bros"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "warner"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "hbo"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "greene & associates talent agency"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "king arthur's joby harold & tory tunnell move safehouse banner to warner bros"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "wb"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "wgn america"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/t1o2C2H78Udv9x6MIntCZn9jXYv3iF84GMtAagtPOE0ZQEO6VR6Scq2KRP.dCBEboMewXWcgf0fRMtN_TsfnacPiVhTtqU8PDP4ah6SO9GHYnQsq.S_2MPQAxKLsrizS", "published": "2017-04-19T01:49:00.000+03:00", "text": "Warner Bros Ashley Nguyen \nEXCLUSIVE : Aisha Hinds has signed on to co-star in Legendary / Warner Bros \u2019 upcoming sequel Godzilla: King Of The Monsters , with Michael Dougherty at the helm.

But the nation's patchwork of pot laws can be confusing \u2013 even in the states where it's allowed \u2013 so here's a blueprint of what you can and can't do in the eight states (plus D.C.) where weed's been legalized for recreational use. Related Jeff Sessions Goes Full 'Reefer Madness' on Pot Attorney general says marijuana is \"only slightly less awful\" than heroin \nIn spite of the best efforts of Attorney General Jeff Sessions, marijuana tourism is booming across the U.S. and policy makers are now trying to figure out the will of their voters. \"While politicians are behind voters, and about half the states don't have voter initiative processes so you've got to rely on the legislatures,\" says Karen O'Keefe, director of state policies for Marijuana Policy Project. \"They're still catching up,\" \nWith many puritanical lawmakers trying to make their imprint on the nation's pot policy, we don't want anyone to hit a snag and have some random cop toss you in the back of her squad car over a little \u2013 or even a lot of \u2013 greenery. So here are the rules of the road: Colorado has a dispensary system that's easy to navigate \u2013 though it's still illegal to smoke outside. Chris Hondros/Getty \nColorado Colorado was ahead of the pack when it came to setting up its recreational pot law, which is in part because there was already a medical marijuana culture that had taken root in the state. \"One of the biggest differences between the states is whether or not there was a medical marijuana distribution system in place before the adult use law passed,\" O'Keefe says. \nBefore you hit the slopes or enjoy the rugged scenery, stop by one of the state's many dispensaries \u2013 but make sure to do it when you have the chance, or you may be left on the top of a mountain without a hit. That's cause the state's legalization law left it up to each locale to decide for themselves if they want weed shops, and even though Colorado's generally cool, many of its lawmakers are pretty lame and restrictive. \nSo the key is just to book a cheaper flight into Denver. If you're 21 or older, you can basically find anything you want in Denver for whatever price you can afford. So you want an upper? They've got you covered. Downer before bed? Done. A gentle edible to make you feel one with the sunset? Any dispensary has a helpful \"bud-tender\" on hand to give you just what you need. \nBecause you can't legally smoke or vape outside in Colorado \u2013 which has been a huge debate \u2013 and many hotels don't allow toking in your room, the edible culture has become strong in the state. But beware, those edibles take a bit to kick in and can often catch the unassuming off guard and give you more of a paranoid fright than the gentle high you were chasing. \nBut if inhalation is your thing, don't worry \u2013 there's options. Several marijuana bus and limo tours exist throughout the state, which allow you to smoke inside the vehicles as they take you on scenic rides around town. And though the state's lawmakers have presently shelved plans to allow marijuana clubs , about 30 private clubs exist and many sell day passes . Watch out, though \u2013 these are in a legal grey area so the authorities may stop by unannounced. \nOregon Like in Colorado, Oregon's marijuana law left it up to individual counties and towns to decide for themselves if they want weed sold like alcohol \u2013 or if they don't. And while the counties closer to the coast tend to be the progressive stereotypes reinforced when binging Portlandia , the rest of the state is quite rural, conservative and even a little backwoodsy. In fact, the state is almost split in the middle \u2013 with the 20 counties mostly to the west allowing legal pot sales, while the 16 counties mostly in the eastern part of the state all prohibiting greenery. \nConsuming legally is tough \u2013 it's against the law to smoke or even partake in edibles in public places, though some hotels along the coast will let you toke. And if you're going to head into the woods for a weekend, make sure you don't have more than an ounce on you because it's illegal to possess any more than that in public (though you can cultivate up to eight ounces on your property). And beware if you're planning to get in touch with nature at one of the state's gorgeous national parks, because it's still illegal to get high on federal lands. \nWashington State Voters and lawmakers here were fine with medical marijuana, but when voters made recreational weed legal things got wacky. \"In Washington is was kind of a mess, because there you had medical marijuana dispensaries but they were at best in a legal grey area because a court had ruled, essentially, they were illegal,\" O'Keefe tells Rolling Stone. \"So you had, side by side, a completely new regulatory system for adult use which was much stricter, with testing and lots of restrictions on where they can be located.\" \nDon't think about busting out your weed in public in Washington State or it's a fine. Smoke in your car? Fine. Weed on your car seat and not your trunk? Fine. Smoke in a park? Fine. Sure those restrictions apply to most all of the states that have legalized recreational weed, but Washington is a different beast. While you can brew your own beer here, you can't legally grow your own weed, unless you have a medical card. Welcome to pot's official nanny state, where restrictive marijuana laws allow you to have just one ounce in private, though state-controlled dispensaries are popping up all over the more progressive areas. Even getting here wasn't easy. \nBut in the past year or so they rolled the medical dispensaries into the regulatory system for recreational stores, which forced those stores to either get a new license or be shuttered \u2013 which, needless to say, pissed off a lot of loyal medicinal customers. 'The Initiative to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol' in Maine bars people from selling infused goods \u2013 but some get around that by giving them away for donation. Whitney Hayward/Portland Press Herald/Getty \nMaine The Pine Tree State may soon need to be renamed after a slim majority of voters \u2013 fewer than 3,000 \u2013 passed a law allowing those other green trees to be regulated like booze and to allow pot clubs, which are basically bars with bongs. But the legislature seems to be taking its sweet time setting up a regulatory regime for weed. In fact, the only thing the legislature and Republican Governor Paul LePage have been able to agree on was raising the legal age to toke from 18 years old, which voters had approved, to 21. \nWith no regulatory regime in place and lawmakers taking their sweet time in passing one, it's still illegal to sell weed, because no one can get a state-approved license if the state doesn't even have licenses to approve. Some clever retailers are trying to get around that by baking marijuana infused goodies and then giving them away for \"free,\" though donations are accepted (and it seems, encouraged). \nPortland is its own little progressive island in the slice of heaven that is Maine. People there have been enjoying legal recreational weed since back in 2013 \u2013 earning it the title of the East Coast's first city to legalize greenery. Want another fun fact? At 3.8 percent, Maine is tied with California for the most citizens with medical marijuana cards, according to the Marijuana Policy Project. Little ole rustic Maine competing with big ass progressive California \u2013 you go girl! \nCalifornia You can now posses weed legally in the Golden State but you can't smoke it in public, which may not seem like news because everyone in California who wanted has been able to smoke weed legally since 1996, when it became the first state in the nation to practically allow medical marijuana. \nBut now that it's legal it should be even easier to score weed, right? Not so fast. The legislature is taking its time setting up a regulatory system for recreational pot dispensaries \u2013 with a target date of 2018. That means you can't get arrested by state and local cops for having up to an ounce of weed, but if you sell any amount you can still get smacked with a $500 fine, though you can give away or receive up to 28.5 grams. \nThe state's legal medical dispensaries also hit a snag of late: Pesticides. California didn't have a law in place to regulate \u2013 as in, prohibit \u2013 the use of pesticides in medical marijuana and some patients had to go to the emergency room in February after ingesting pesticide-laced greenery. Those new regulations are expected to be rolled into the recreational regulatory bill next year as well. In Massachusetts, activists got their way when pot was legalized last year \u2013 though it could take till 2018 for a system to be set up so residents can purchase it legally. Jonathan Wiggs/The Boston Globe/Getty \nMassachusetts Northeasterners just seem to live at a different pace than the rest of us. So while it's been legal to smoke and possess up to an ounce of weed since last December, it remains illegal to sell or buy weed. The legislature was expected to set up its regulatory system this year with a start date for pot shops to open in January 2018. But politics happened and anti-pot lawmakers voted to move the date back six months \u2013 and Republican Governor Charlie Baker signed the bill \u2013 so lawmakers now have until at least July 1st, 2018 to set up a regulatory system, though even that could get pushed back, too. Lucky for residents there's still medical marijuana dispensaries in some parts of the state, though that does little for you pot tourists out there. \nNevada If the home of Sin City can't figure out how to set up a legalized marijuana regime then our nation's green experiment may as well be over. Luckily, legislators from the home of legalized prostitution and gambling are working to quickly set up regulations to govern the state's newest legal pastime. \nSince their state resolution passed last November, you can legally possess up to an ounce of the goods, but if you get caught with even a gram more than that you can get hit with up to a $600 fine. You also can't smoke in public \u2013 even on the Vegas strip where one would think everything that felt good was legal. \nBut there's a chance this could all change soon. Lawmakers here are hoping to follow Colorado's example and jump head-first into legalization \u2013 possibly getting their recreational system of licensing and taxation up as early as July. \nAlaska It's hard living in America's rugged frontier, and that's especially the case for stoners, even though dispensaries have been open since 2015. Earlier this year, many of the state's dispensaries couldn't get enough marijuana to satiate the needs of their clientele \u2013 causing some to sell out of their product within hours of opening . Know why? Because legalizing weed doesn't actually grow weed \u2013 that takes time. \nWhile you can't legally smoke in public, the good news is that you can possess up to an ounce with no fear of penalty, and if you have property in the state, you can keep up to four ounces at home. But if you get caught with any more than an ounce you can get smacked with a $10,000 fine and a year in the slammer. And if you walk within 500 ft. of a school or recreational center with even a loose nug in your pocket they can slap you with a $50,000 fine and five years behind bars. So keep cool and keep your weed away from the kids. \nWashington, D.C. Citizens of Washington, D.C. may not have a vote in Congress, but they do have a say on their own local issues. With so many young black men incarcerated for possessing even small amounts of weed, in 2015, the city overwhelmingly voted to legalize marijuana outright for anyone of the legal drinking age \u2013 including many older African Americans who oppose legalized pot but just want their kids and grandkids out of jail. \nBut Congress gets the final word on the federal city and Republicans voted to block the council from setting up a regulatory regime for marijuana. Because only medicinal marijuana shops can legally sell weed, most citizens still have to score it on the black market. Practically, that congressional prohibition means adult-use marijuana is merely decriminalized in D.C. \nThat means you can only smoke in your house and grow up to six plants. But watch out \u2013 you could get smacked with a $1,000 fine and six month prison sentence if you get caught with more than two ounces. Though many people smoke outside, if you get caught smoking in public, you could face up to 60 days in prison and a $500 fine. (Don't try it on the National Mall, though, as that's federal property and could mean real trouble.) And though you can't sell weed, you can legally give or receive up to an ounce. \nSee how celebrities are getting in on the THC craze. Watch here.

The crown jewel of the issue is cover star Julia Roberts, People's Most Beautiful Woman of 2017 . Unfortunately, People Magazine got it wrong: The most beautiful woman in the world is me. \nI have no way of knowing the process by which People chooses its Most Beautiful Woman every year, or how they parcel out specific beautiful celebrities from other beautiful celebrities, or why they overlooked me completely. In a letter at the beginning of the issue, People Editor-in-Chief Jess Cagle writes, \"When it came time to choose a cover for the 2017 World\u2019s Most Beautiful Issue, it seemed that the time was right for Julia Roberts. At 49, Julia has never looked better. But her beauty also lies in her self-assurance and smarts and good humor.\" \nI have no problem with that statement, but I will say this: If never looking better and having self-assurance, smarts, and good humor are the qualities by which one is selected, I don't know why it couldn't be me (or someone like me) on that cover. Our favorite pretty woman #JuliaRoberts is PEOPLE's World's #MostBeautiful Woman \u2014 for the record fifth time! https://t.co/LuHlCkaONA pic.twitter.com/x9vr2kjR2Z \u2014 People Magazine (@people) April 19, 2017 \nWhat I do know, though, is that while Julia Roberts, a five-time World's Most Beautiful cover honoree, is beautiful, she's beautiful by a set of very explicit standards \u2014 standards that many women find impossible to meet or (gasp) don't want to meet. Roberts is gorgeous, yes, but she's also thin, white, cisgender, and able-bodied. Perhaps you find that beautiful \u2014 I do too \u2014 but beauty comes in infinite forms. How can we say Roberts is the most beautiful when everyone's standards of beauty are completely, totally, and blessedly different? And if that's the case, doesn't that mean that in certain contexts, I'm the most beautiful as well? \nHere's the thing: Lack of representation doesn't mean you never get to see something that diverts from the norm. People has given the honor to four women of color in the past (Halle Berry in 2003, Jennifer Lopez in 2011, Beyonc\u00e9 in 2012, and Lupita Nyong'o in 2014). \nHowever, they are all thin, cis, and able-bodied, and still represent a total of fewer covers than Roberts was awarded herself. It makes sense, too. People is a magazine about celebrities, and celebrities are what make up Hollywood. According to a research study performed by the Media, Diversity and Social Change Initiative at USC's Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, only 28.3 percent of speaking roles in movies went to people of color in 2016 \u2014 subtract from that the men of color, and women of color are left with even less opportunity. When it comes to people with disabilities (who are virtually nonexistent in Hollywood ) and trans folks, the numbers are even more grim \u2014 and magazines about Hollywood inevitably follow suit. \nBy approaching a mass audience with this kind of content, mainstream media is staking the claim that out of all the representations of beauty in this world, thin, white (and every so often, brown), cis women are at the highest level of conventional beauty accomplishment. Making your way to that level means adhering to these rigid and aspirational standards \u2014 and if you're not, you're not the most. \nBut what if we reimagined what the phrase \"most beautiful\" actually means? What if it meant that by whatever standards you use to frame beauty, you're at the top? What if it meant that you could be the most beautiful, whether you're fat, brown, disabled, trans, or otherwise \u2014 because those qualities are the most appreciated, the most valued, the most deserving? What if we acknowledged that beauty is a construct and therefore should be considered with the utmost subjectivity, leaving all of us to define ourselves as the most beautiful, by whichever terms feel right to us? \nSo with that, I'll unapologetically grab that title: I'm fat, I'm tall, I'm over 30, my pores are pretty big, and my nose is pretty Polish. My teeth are kind of yellow from all the coffee I drink, and my nails are ripped to shreds. Like Julia, I'm self-assured, smart, and have good humor \u2014 but I'm also bossy, intense, and selfish. Like Julia, my appearance affords me a lot of privilege \u2014 and that privilege means I have an easier time asserting myself as beautiful than others do, a fact that I'd like to change. I want to see more Most Beautifuls: black women, trans women, women with disabilities, fat women, women over 60. When the \"Most Beautiful\" means the most of whatever beauty standards you set for yourself, you're automatically at the top.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday promised big wins in the next stretch of his administration, glossing past the reality that the political newcomer will celebrate his first 100 days without a major legislative victory. \nIn a speech that could be seen as a messaging test for that milestone, Trump hailed the opening days of his administration as a wild success and pledged to quickly deliver on health care, tax reform and infrastructure. Story Continued Below \n\u201cNo administration has accomplished more in the first 90 days,\u201d Trump declared in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where he toured tool manufacturer Snap-on before delivering his remarks. \u201cThat includes on military, on the border, on trade, on regulation, on law enforcement \u2014 we love our law enforcement \u2014 and on government reform.\u201d \nTrump\u2019s claim is in line with his past rhetoric \u2014 he told reporters nearly two weeks ago that he\u2019s had \u201cone of the most successful 13 weeks in the history of the presidency.\u201d (Thursday will actually mark the first 13 weeks of his administration.) \nTrump, to his credit, has signed a host of executive orders and successfully nominated Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. But his presidency has been marred by White House infighting, staff shakeups and reorganization, court-ordered suspensions of his travel ban, evolving positions on campaign pledges, potential conflicts of interest, questions over transparency, and FBI and congressional investigations into his associates\u2019 possible ties to Russian agents. By Matthew Nussbaum \nPerhaps most devastating, however, was the administration\u2019s failed effort last month to usher legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare through the Republican-controlled House. Nevertheless, Trump suggested Tuesday that health care reform is imminent, casting it as the first major hurdle to cross before accelerating through his legislative agenda. \nTrump encouraged attendees at the Snap-on facility to call their congressmen and \u201cpress everybody\u201d to support GOP leaders\u2019 legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare so Congress could pass tax reform next. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin once flagged August as a realistic deadline for a tax overhaul but has since acknowledged that is \u201chighly aggressive to not realistic at this point.\u201d \nBut Trump insisted that \u201cwe\u2019re on time, if we get that health care approval.\u201d It\u2019s unclear, however, whether the president was indicating that his administration is on time to complete a tax package by August or whether his comments were making clear that the White House isn\u2019t behind on enacting its legislative agenda despite the health care stumble. \n\u201cWe wanna get that approval,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd it just makes the tax reform easier, and it makes it better. It\u2019s gonna make it steeper. It\u2019s gonna be bigger, and that\u2019s what we wanna do.\u201d \nDemocrats and transparency advocates have argued that tax reform is impossible without the president first disclosing his tax returns to the American people to see how he could benefit from legislation he has the authority to sign into law. \n\u201cUntil Pres Trump releases his full tax returns, a cloud of suspicion will remain & make it much harder to pass tax reform through Congress,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer tweeted.

We\u2019re gonna be announcing it very soon,\u201d he said. \u201cBut health care, we have to get the health care taken care of. And as soon as health care takes care of, we are gonna march very quickly. You\u2019re gonna watch. We\u2019re gonna surprise you. Right, Steve Mnuchin? Right?\u201d \nThe president didn\u2019t end his bold promises there. He added infrastructure spending to the mix. Trump has proposed an investment in American infrastructure that could exceed a $1 trillion price tag, a figure for which Schumer and other Democrats have expressed support. \nTrump said his administration will repair the nation\u2019s \u201cbadly depleted infrastructure \u2026 soon.\u201d But he wasn't clear about how he would accomplish that. \n\u201cInfrastructure. Big infrastructure bill,\u201d Trump said. \u201cProbably use it with something else that\u2019s a little bit harder to get approved in order to get that approved. But infrastructure is coming, and it\u2019s coming fast.\u201d \nTrump toured Snap-on to tout a \u201cBuy American, Hire American\u201d executive order designed to make good on his campaign pledge to put America \u2014 and Americans \u2014 first. Trump has often come under fire for his position, given that the billionaire businessman has had products manufactured overseas and relied on foreign workers for cheap labor. \nIn a museum-like display room featuring a table of Snap-on products sold as souvenirs, Snap-on CEO Nick Pinchuk told the president that some customers wanted a box large enough to carry ashes following a cremation, according to a White House pool report. \n\u201cThat\u2019s depressing,\u201d Trump replied. \nHe signed the executive order after speaking at the plant. And while his remarks at times centered on how the administration will prioritize American workers and U.S. products, the president\u2019s speech included big pledges and tough talk on trade. \nPromising to stand up for Wisconsin\u2019s dairy farmers, Trump singled out Canada for doing \u201csome very unfair things,\u201d which he didn\u2019t detail but said he had read about. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s happened to you is very, very unfair. It\u2019s another typical one-sided deal against the United States, and it\u2019s not gonna be happening for long,\u201d Trump said, promising to call Canada and \u201cget the solution, not just the answer\u201d to what happened. \nHe continued ripping NAFTA, as he did on the campaign trail, calling the North American trade pact \u201ca complete and total disaster.\u201d \n\u201cNAFTA\u2019s been very, very bad for our country,\u201d Trump added. \u201cIt\u2019s been very, very bad for our companies and for our workers, and we\u2019re gonna make some very big changes or we are going to get rid of NAFTA for once and for all. Cannot continue like this. Believe me.\u201d \nTrump said his \u201chistoric\u201d executive order would help protect workers by declaring \u201cthe policy of our government is to aggressively promote and use American-made goods and to ensure that American labor is hired to do the job.\u201d \nReporters asked White House policy aide Stephen Miller why the order was necessary because it appears that many, or perhaps even all, of the provisions could be accomplished without executive action, according to a pool report. Miller declined to respond and boarded Air Force One for the trip back to Washington, D.C."}, {"crawled": "2017-04-18T14:30:50.000+03:00", "title": "Gadget designers, please stop being so left-hander hostile - The Verge", "external_links": [], "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "cf30a6d59b51b5e1213abb7d0731db71e0aa0254", "author": "", "thread": {"section_title": "", "title": "Gadget designers, please stop being so left-hander hostile - The Verge", "site_full": "www.theverge.com", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 5}, "linkedin": {"shares": 12}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 924, "likes": 924}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "title_full": "Gadget designers, please stop being so left-hander hostile - The Verge", "site_type": "news", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.a0ERDGN194XDzDOfi07qD5c11elJmUiDBlZ.bnW2i1Y4VC0ZdVGxt21_S2zm_YA_df4n0q9ofOgxkGnfwyrTGxPtS1EEYTkb3uHxDGTyYaQ--", "uuid": "cf30a6d59b51b5e1213abb7d0731db71e0aa0254", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "domain_rank": 496, "spam_score": 1.0, "country": "US", "site": "theverge.com", "main_image": "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-AFWpVbzBRUBhsdm4gbweNk94JU=/0x106:2040x1254/1600x900/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/54310427/vpavic_220317_1557_0214.0.0.jpg", "site_section": "", "published": "2017-04-18T14:30:50.000+03:00", "performance_score": 9, "site_categories": []}, "highlightText": "", "rating": null, "ord_in_thread": 0, "entities": {"persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "vjeran pavic"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dan seifert"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "bangkok"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "samsung galaxy"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "apple"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "samsung galaxy s8"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "samsung"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.a0ERDGN194XDzDOfi07qD5c11elJmUiDBlZ.bnW2i1Y4VC0ZdVGxt21_S2zm_YA_df4n0q9ofOgxkGnfwyrTGxPtS1EEYTkb3uHxDGTyYaQ--", "published": "2017-04-18T14:30:50.000+03:00", "text": "The Samsung Galaxy S8 will arrive in consumers\u2019 hands this week, but one thing that has bothered me since the leaks and rumors began flooding the web is where the fingerprint scanner is placed. And no, it\u2019s not just that it\u2019s right next to the camera. It\u2019s the fact that it\u2019s not centered, making it awkward for left-handers to slide their index finger over without smudging the camera lens when holding the phone in their dominant hand.\nI\u2019ve become obsessed with my left-handedness ever since my father tried to switch me when I was in the first grade (admittedly a little late, but he succeeded in getting me to at least write with my right). In instances that didn\u2019t involve writing, however, I rebelled. When school teachers in Bangkok, where I grew up, would tell me to switch my utensil hand from left to right during our lunch periods, I\u2019d wait until they walked away to swap back. When I was bored in a college lecture, I\u2019d pass time by taking notes with my left hand. It took a little longer, but I wanted to reconnect the part of me that was born this way, but was forced to change without choice.\nBeing hyper-aware of living as a left-hander in a right-handed world, I pick up on design biases daily when reviewing gadgets for my job. I\u2019m mildly annoyed with Samsung and the S8 because the company has appears to be historically unfriendly to left-handers, with the stylus on the Note always stored on the bottom right side. This means I have to move my palm or switch hands back and forth each time I need to draw out the stylus. When the first Samsung Galaxy phone with a curved edge display came out, the company completely disregarded how left-handers could use the device .\nhow 2 use galaxy note edge with your left hand pic.twitter.com/FkwYuCmtxw\n\u2014 dan seifert (@dcseifert) September 3, 2014 Other tech leaders could do better, too; on Android, switching to a Right-To-Left layout requires digging deep into developer mode , making it seem as if that option is simply not important enough to display upfront. And why is Apple adamant on not centering the digital crown on its smartwatches? Using the Apple Watch upside down isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world, but it\u2019s one of the many things that suggest left-handed design is an afterthought for most tech companies.\nto tech companies, left-handed design is just an afterthought Maybe we\u2019re entering into whining territory here. I\u2019m not asking tech companies to make a left-handed version of every gadget out there just to appease the 10 percent of the population \u2014 about 700 million people \u2014 that may care.

A fulfillment centre is basically what Amazon calls the big ol' warehouse it uses to store and ship products. There's been no decision on which city headquarters will be in, according to Fairfax. \nA country manager will also be hired, as well as hundreds of other employees to flesh out the Aussie expansion. \nAustralians have already been able to use an Australian Kindle store on the Amazon website, which launched in 2012, and there are already almost 1000 employees in the country. \n\"The next step is to bring a retail offering to Australia and we are making those plans now,\" Amazon said in a statement. \nAmazon's retail expansion will come as good news to small business owners, while existing, larger retailers will no doubt be worried by the online marketplace's effect here. Macy's, Walmart and larger stores across America have all closed hundreds of stores in the wake of Amazon's (and other online outlets') domination of the retail industry.

I also realized how mean the process is. It\u2019s something that is not spoken about enough.\u201d \nThe younger Trump also minimized the impact of \u201cevery sensational blogger who is trying to get a couple of clicks, who is totally irrelevant, and no one reads their column,\u201d later describing his online critics as \u201cevery little one blogger who is out there writing some sensational article.\u201d \nWhile Trump also criticized the media for attacking his younger sister Tiffany and younger brother Barron (a criticism that this author has echoed in the past), he insisted that he and the other Trump children have been \u201cforced to develop an armour and that\u2019s fine. I think we do it very well. You learn to ignore it.\u201d \nHe added, \u201cPolitics is a mean game. I always said real estate is the most cut-throat industry in the world \u2013 but it is nothing compared to some of these politicians.\u201d \nBut, Eric Trump argued, his father\u2019s frequent golf trips are making him a better politician. \n\u201cYou can sit with somebody in a golf cart where there might be cultural differences and language barriers and have a good time and build a friendship in a way that you could never do sitting across an office table from someone,\u201d Trump said, pointing to his father\u2019s trips to his Mar-a-Lago resort. \nTrump described Mar-a-Lago as \u201can amazing estate that has been a very effective tool\u201d for his father to \u201cget to know somebody.\u201d \nLater in the interview, Trump mentioned that the thing that bothers his father the most are \u201cthe falsehoods.\u201d \n\u201cHe is the one person who did not need this job,\u201d Trump defensively said of his father. \u201cHe is a man who has achieved every aspect of success \u2014 wealth, family \u2014 in fact so many people often come up to me and talk about him and the concept of the American dream. He is the epitome of the American dream.\u201d \nMatthew Rozsa is a breaking news writer for Salon.

According to a statement from the network, O'Reilly's departure is \"effective immediately.\" \n\"After a thorough and careful review of the allegations, the Company and Bill O'Reilly have agreed that Bill O'Reilly will not be returning to the Fox News Channel,\" parent company 21st Century Fox said in a statement. \nBeginning Monday, the day O'Reilly was scheduled to return from a two-week vacation , Tucker Carlson will take over O'Reilly's 8 p.m. timeslot. The Five will move into Carlson's previously-held 9 p.m. slot beginning Monday. \nAlec Baldwin skewers Bill O'Reilly on SNL \nEarlier Wednesday, New York magazine reported that one of the issues being worked out between Fox and O'Reilly was whether the host would be allowed to return to say a proper goodbye to his viewers. It appears that that will not happen. (Dana Perino and Greg Gutfield will host The Factor for the remainder of this week.) \nThe O'Reilly Factor host became increasingly toxic after the New York Times reported that O'Reilly and/or Fox News have paid at least five women to not pursue legal action or speak publicly about their sexual harassment allegations against him. The payouts have totaled about $13 million. \nThe company previously stood by O'Reilly through public scandal before, even renewing his contract earlier this month. But now, in the wake of advertisers jumping ship and public opinion turning against O'Reilly (even among The O'Reilly Factor' s viewers, according to a survey by Morning Consult ), Fox News is putting the political commentator, who has been with the network since its inception in 1996, out to pasture. \nO'Reilly released a statement on Wednesday afternoon, saying it is \"tremendously disheartening\" to leave the network under the current circumstances. \n\"Over the past 20 years at Fox News, I have been extremely proud to launch and lead one of the most successful news programs in history, which has consistently informed and entertained millions of Americans and significantly contributed into building Fox into the dominant news network in television,\" O'Reilly said. \"It is tremendously disheartening that we part ways due to completely unfounded claims. But it is the unfortunate reality that many in the public eye must live with today. I will always look back on my time at Fox with great pride in the unprecedented success we achieved and with my deepest gratitude to all my dedicated viewers. I wish only the best for Fox News Channel.\" \nO'Reilly's axing continues a streak of misfortune for cable's top-rated news network, which lost its founder and CEO Roger Ailes last summer in a similar sexual harassment scandal and saw the departure of Megyn Kelly earlier this year. \nEditors note: The story was changed to reflect O'Reilly's statement to the media."}, {"crawled": "2017-04-18T11:44:52.000+03:00", "title": "Erika Jayne Is Eliminated From 'Dancing With The Stars' & Fans Are Devastated", "external_links": [], "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "c7055b6d350f2fea6506d8724f2f60a07e69f73f", "author": "Lindsay Denninger", "thread": {"section_title": "", "title": "Erika Jayne Is Eliminated From 'Dancing With The Stars' & Fans Are Devastated", "site_full": "www.bustle.com", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 919, "likes": 919}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "title_full": "Erika Jayne Is Eliminated From 'Dancing With The Stars' & Fans Are Devastated", "site_type": "news", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRxLPlCCxqn6b3sacsfxkB5C3CDhlk1FVe7c7xPTc7QNFFsWvoh0yVAKDlTzB8RUjv19lbtFmSoXtUrNiXikTO5b_qSGf._nfvdTBkueGNzOOLuGS6ErQXyxA1kS58J4zVXYZJ73j.zMQ--", "uuid": "c7055b6d350f2fea6506d8724f2f60a07e69f73f", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "domain_rank": 1318, "spam_score": 0.755, "country": "US", "site": "bustle.com", "main_image": "https://typeset-beta.imgix.net/2017%2F4%2F18%2F0941010f-ce07-47a1-a134-121952c81cb8.jpg?w=1200&amp;h=630&amp;fm=jpg&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=faces&amp;auto=format&amp;q=70", "site_section": "", "published": "2017-04-18T10:28:00.000+03:00", "performance_score": 9, "site_categories": []}, "highlightText": "", "rating": null, "ord_in_thread": 0, "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRxLPlCCxqn6b3sacsfxkB5C3CDhlk1FVe7c7xPTc7QNFFsWvoh0yVAKDlTzB8RUjv19lbtFmSoXtUrNiXikTO5b_qSGf._nfvdTBkueGNzOOLuGS6ErQXyxA1kS58J4zVXYZJ73j.zMQ--", "published": "2017-04-18T10:28:00.000+03:00", "text": "Erika Jayne Is Eliminated From 'Dancing With The Stars' & Fans Are Devastated Eric McCandless/ABC By Lindsay Denninger 6 hours ago \nWell, I officially have one fewer reason to tune into this season of Dancing With The Stars ! All of my favorite people seem to be in jeopardy, and tonight, things got real. Erika Jayne was eliminated from Dancing With The Stars , and, like, me many of her fans are upset that she was kicked off over Nick Viall. \nErika is certainly not the best dancer on the show, but she\u2019s also not the worst. The worst, IMO, would be Nick Viall, former Bachelor and hanger-on of other Bachelor Nation shows. Nick\u2019s Pinocchio performance was pretty wooden (pun intended), and I feel like Erika was just getting into her groove on Dancing With The Stars . I mean, she was so emotional this week! Erika felt like on the April 10 episode of Dancing With The Stars that she didn\u2019t give it her all, and this week, she vowed to, dancing to \u201cUnforgettable\u201d from the Finding Dory soundtrack. Unfortunately, the fans didn\u2019t forget last week\u2019s \u201cmeh\u201d performance, and Erika and Gleb\u2019s efforts this week weren\u2019t enough . I\u2019m not the only Erika Jayne fan that\u2019s disappointed by her elimination \u2014 Twitter lit up with grumbles and mumbles about Nick being eliminated first and Erika giving it her all this week. ERIKA REALLY GOT KICKED OFF FOR BEING 'too sexy' #DWTS \u2014 kelsey #TeamValmani (@h4rmotional) April 18, 2017 at least Erika Jayne went out on a high note. (however. other people definitely deserved to be off before her) #dwts "}, {"crawled": "2017-04-18T09:20:28.000+03:00", "title": "Ducks roar back to defeat Flames in OT, take 3-0 series lead |

It\u2019s not just all Nickelodeon cartoons and Disney princesses and discontinued lines of dunkable graham crackers. For this generation of Geocities slickers, growing up in the \u201990s also meant living on the receiving end of what the advent of computers meant for education; the twenty- and thirtysomethings whose thinkpieces you now actively ignore online probably first learned their typing skills and pixelated prowess through the educational programs worshipped in an ancient house of sacrifice known as a \u201ccomputer lab.\u201d \nThis \u201ccomputer lab\u201d was a temple, and as with any altar, there were deities worth worshipping \u2014 and apparently, these goddesses have been deemed worthy of late indoctrination to a new, savvier generation of children. That\u2019s the conceit, anyway, with so many of these nostalgic rebirths, but something feels different about folks like Carmen Sandiego or The Magic School Bus \u2018 Miss Frizzle. It\u2019s no longer a curious thing for \u201990s icons to be back in vogue, but these characters demand to be seen through a different lens than the rest of the reboot mania dominating the zeitgeist. \nCarmen Sandiego, of course, is the original anti-hero, whose livelihood began in the mid-1980s when Broderbund Software began using her disappearance to teach children how to read an almanac. As a purveyor of history and geography, Carmen was a criminal crowd favorite, perhaps for her aspirational style and limitless travel expenses, possibly for her rejection of societal shame over the lengths one should go to visit a museum, but most likely for her refusal to stay tied down to any one region or, when she got her hands on a time machine, social epoch. Carmen was free and had zero effs to give, a trailblazing type of teacher who may have strayed from the legal path in her ascertainment of artifacts but ultimately still demonstrated more nobility than misbehavior to her students. (By the way, if you think millennials feel like they\u2019re entitled to the world, it\u2019s only because Carmen Sandiego basically told them to be.) \nTo follow Carmen was to boldly follow the triumphs of human nature, a pursuit shared by Carmen\u2019s new colleague, Miss Valerie Frizzle, another heavy-hitter of the edutainment era. Frizzle and her Magic School Bus ( which will also arrive, revived, on Netflix ) caused trouble simply for the love of the knowledge game, forcing her students into outrageous adventures in large galaxies and small intestines, bending the rules of society for the sake of understanding it better. \nThey\u2019re both brilliant, clever, self-reliant, gleefully naughty women, and recent events have shown that archetype to be nothing less than what a hero of 2017 looks like right now. What makes the Netflix resurgence of these two digital doyennes so special is how their return signals a hopefulness for their new audience: An invitation to reclaim the power of technology for disruption, a return from cynicism back to imagination, a reminder that real information is worth looking for when it\u2019s not readily available through typical channels. It\u2019s a lesson both \u201990s and 9-year-old children could use about now. \nAnd the lesson doesn\u2019t end with Carmen and Frizzle, nor does it follow a generational line. Netflix also has Bill Nye Saves the World , a scientific and political talk show aimed at speaking to the kid in decidedly pessimistic adults, and Julie\u2019s Greenroom , Julie Andrews\u2019 musical puppet show about representation and the importance of the arts (which bears as crucial a message for children to hear as it does for the adults with the actual means and occupations to address and fix it). Sesame Street , meanwhile, continues to reinvent its own game on HBO, introducing headline-making characters (like Julia, a Muppet with autism) and doing its damned fuzziest best to continue its life\u2019s work of making children good people. \nAll that\u2019s left, one can hope, is for other networks to continue Netflix\u2019s lead and relocate the figures (both computerized and televised) who can do that rare thing of teaching old dogs old tricks. Bring back Wishbone , who can speak to that beautiful cross-demographic of Jane Austen fans and dog memes. Revive Ghostwriter , and take back the power of texting and composition notebooks. Most importantly, get thee to a Schoolhouse Rock , because it\u2019s clearer than ever that it\u2019s not just children who need to learn how a bill actually becomes a law.

Wedding invitations had been sent only five days before.\nNever before \u2014 or since \u2014 had a sitting president taken his vows in the White House. But while many facets of Cleveland's executive affair resembled 21st-century wedding revelry, the Blue Room ceremony would seem strange in some ways to a modern wedding guest.\nThe newlyweds did not kiss to seal their vows; the stoic president detested such a public display of affection. And the cake was far from a white-frosted, tiered confection.\nThe Clevelands celebrated with a 25-pound nut-laden fruitcake, which was common for wedding cakes until almost the 20th century, says Claire Stewart, author of As Long as We Both Shall Eat: A History of Wedding Food and Feasts .\nAs Stewart, a former executive chef and culinary management professor, explains in her new book, \"the white layered confection known today is a fairly modern invention.\" But the rituals of the cake, including joint cutting and sharing, are centuries old.\nThe Salt When Food Truck Horns Meet Wedding Bells Stewart believes that studying the feasts and fancies of weddings past offers so much more than historical detail. It provides insight into our own lives \u2014 why we celebrate as we do today.\nFor example, the symbolism behind cake traditions likely encompasses a complex mix of purity, fertility and superstition.\n\"Ancient Roman wedding ceremonies were finalized by breaking a cake of wheat or barley ( mustaceum ) over the bride's head as a symbol of good fortune,\" Carol Wilson writes in the food studies journal Gastronomica .\nIt's likely this particular ritual was also a very public display signaling the groom's new possession of his bride's virginity. Modern wedding cakes, with their snowy white and flowery exteriors, can be seen as an extension of this same concept.\nBut the modern wedding cake's rise to \"visual cornerstone and iconic marriage symbol\" is just one aspect of the feast of wedding history that Stewart's book serves up.\nAs privileged guests raised a glass to the newlywed President and Mrs. Cleveland, they were likely unaware they were partaking in a toasting practice dating back as far as the sixth century. Stewart writes that the tradition of the champagne wedding toast \"stems from a time when unions between warring factions could serve to forge peace.\"\nA celebratory sip from a communal cup by the father of the bride at a reception once signified to all in attendance that the provided wine was safe to consume. And clinking glasses together might be part of a long-held superstition that the sound scared away the devil. Even the term \"toast\" likely stems from \"a time when spirits were often rancid, and a piece of spiced bread was put into the cup to improve the flavor,\" Stewart writes.\nWedding trends \u2014 as well as standards of etiquette \u2014 have historically trickled down from the upper echelons, Stewart explains, \"with the lower classes eager to replicate the restrained behavior of their so-called betters.\"\nIn the Renaissance era, for example, \"peasants or the lower classes had very raucous wedding affairs, with lots of drinking and games. It was considered a giant party where everyone and anyone was invited.\" These boisterous parties were also meant to prove that a bride's family could afford to throw an extravagant celebration.\nBut, according to Stewart, \"the wealthy elite didn't have to work to project wealth,\" so their wedding celebrations were much more subdued. Soon, upwardly mobile members of the middle class took notice of how the wealthy elite incorporated specific guest lists and careful itineraries into their wedding festivities. By the 1800s, the more \"staid wedding repast\" became the idealized wedding for everyone.\nDuring the Victorian age, when restraint and propriety were paramount virtues , the focus of the wedding celebration suddenly shifted away from the food and onto the decorations.\n\"Victorians tended to see all indulgence as filthy. The consumption of food in general seemed to them a rather animalistic endeavor \u2014 one they wanted to distance themselves from as much as possible,\" Stewart says. It was impolite to even comment on the wedding food at all.\nBlame this for the intense importance that some modern couples put on centerpieces and wedding favors.\nEnlarge this image When President Grover Cleveland married Frances Folsom at the White House in 1886, they celebrated with a 25-pound nut-laden fruitcake.

Times , dated June 10, 1886, reveals that guests at Cleveland's wedding were sent home with \"satin boxes containing dainty pieces of the bridal cake, each one bearing the hand-painted monogram \"C.\u2014F.\" While presumably most revelers ate their gifts shortly after the wedding, at least a couple of pieces have been preserved for posterity.\nThe Grover Cleveland Birthplace museum in Caldwell, N.J., houses a 130-year-old slice in its collection \u2014 albeit with one bite missing.

April 18, 2017 at 09:41AM By The Lafayette , writer at creators.co 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' [Credit: Disney / Lucasfilm] By The Lafayette , writer at Creators.co I'm an Entertainment Journalist and novelist, I love Star Wars and anything Superhero related! (Secretly also an Agent of Shield) \nWith the recent release of the teaser trailer for Star Wars: The Last Jedi , there has been a lot of conversation about the concept of \u201cGray Jedi.\u201d This was perpetrated by the following quote in the trailer: \nLuke Skywalker: \"Breath. Just breath. Now, reach out. What do you see?\" \nRey: \"Light. Darkness. A balance.\" Ultimate Guide To 'Star Wars 8: The Last Jedi': News, Trailer, Cast & All You Need To Know \nThis quote seems to indicate that there is much more to The Force then just the Jedi and Sith. Moreover, the two opposing orders may be just the tip of a very large iceberg regarding The Force and its place in the universe. With the mention of balance between the light and darkness in the trailer, many began to wonder if #Disney was bringing in the controversial Gray Jedi. \nThe idea of the Gray Jedi is very prolific in the old Expanded Universe and in the MMO, The Old Republic, which may or may not be in the new canon. Much of the idea of balance \u2014 which is being discussed in the new #StarWars canon under Disney \u2014 has its roots in the philosophy of the Gray Jedi. So, for those who are unfamiliar with the concept here is EVERYTHING you need to know about Gray Jedi. Gray Jedi Is Not A Title 'Star Wars: The Phantom Menace' [Credit: Lucasfilm] \nGray Jedi is not a title for a Jedi knight but rather a description of how they use The Force. Typically, it is used to describe a Jedi that dabbles in both the light and dark side of the force. Gray Jedi call on the dark side of the Force, but are not corrupted by it and do not embrace it entirely. A good example of this is Mace Windu, a Jedi who uses the dark side when in combat but abandons it when the battle is finished. Though it is debated, many have called Qui-Gon Jinn a Gray due to his dabbling in immortality. In fact, Tyvokka once said: \n\"Jinn always does things his own way, always sure he is right, always incredulous if we do not see it his way. Some think he is a Gray Jedi.\" A Gray Jedi Is Still A Jedi 'Star Wars: The Phantom Menace' [Credit: Lucasfilm] \nGray Jedi are not another order like the Sith, they are Jedi who embrace both views of the force and use both dark and light to their advantage. To a Gray Jedi the Force is just the Force; it is the individual that creates the dark side and the light side. In the acclaimed game, Knights of the Old Republic II , Gray Jedi are described as such: \nGray Jedi are those who, though having completed the teachings of the Jedi, operate independently and outside of the Jedi Council. They are typically seen as misguided, though they have not necessarily succumbed to the dark side. Their Use Of The Force 'Star Wars: The Clone Wars' [Credit: Lucasfilm] \nAll Gray Jedi display the use of both light and dark side Force abilities, and demonstrate skill in techniques common to both Jedi and Sith. These included: Force choke, Force lightning, healing, mind tricks, controlling animals and Force throws. While Gray Jedi do not adhere solely to the light side of The Force, they are free from the malevolent influences of the dark side. It is important to distinguish that Jedi who have suffered any corruption from the dark side \u2014 even if they are redeemed \u2014 are not considered to be #GrayJedi . Examples Of Gray Jedi 'Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith' [Credit: Lucasfilm] \nThe Imperial Knights: These were an order of Force practitioners loyal to the Emperor of the Fel Empire. They used the force in combat and leaned towards the light side. The Jedi council tolerated them and viewed them as Gray. \nMace Windu: Mace used a form of lightsaber combat known as Vaapad. It was a form that channeled the dark side in allowing the user to feel the thrill of battle and victory. Windu was the only user to not fall to the dark side of The Force. \nQui-Gon Jinn: It is up for debate if Jinn was truly considered a Gray Jedi. He was at odds with the council for many years and was known to study arts that were frowned upon by the Jedi (such as the path to immortality). \nJolee Bindo: A self-described Gray Jedi, Bindo separated himself from the Jedi council and operated as a smuggler and ally of the former Jedi and Sith Lord Revan. What Does This All Mean? \nThe Gray Jedi sought to expand the understanding of The Force and how it operates. The order was created to show that just because someone was a Jedi or Sith did not make them fully evil or good. It began to show that the Jedi were not all white knights and the Sith were not always the black hats. While much of this information is found in the old canon, Lucasfilm has been converting much of the old Expanded Universe into the new canon. Much of the philosophy of the force found in Star Wars Rebels and in the Force Awakens is from the old canon. \nDo you think that Gray Jedi are coming to the film universe?

Barbie Roberts \u2014 apparently that\u2019s the doll\u2019s full name \u2014 has an active vlogging presence on YouTube , with dozens of episodes that have hundreds of thousands of views each. Among the topics she covers: her likes and dislikes (honey and clowns, respectively); her best friends; and, in her most shocking installment, her love of cosplay. In a video posted last June, she revealed that one of her favorite activities to do online is search for brilliant cosplay creations. Barbie even debuted her own cosplay for her thousands of fans, in an attempt to connect with her audience ... which probably doesn\u2019t have much crossover with the group of people who are enthralled with various Valve games. Maybe we\u2019re wrong on that front, though. The video currently has more than 650,000 views, with fans commenting that a Barbie who was into Portal was their kind of vlogger. But more exciting is the thought that Barbie is introducing a legion of tween girls to this masterpiece of puzzle game design. As Barbie dons her impressive GLaDOS costume \u2014 she dyes her hair silver and everything! \u2014 she asserts her love for both Portal and its most memorable character. She even does an inspired GLaDOS vocal impression. (It\u2019s especially cool that one of Portal \u2019sdesigners was a woman.) She also spends some time dabbing later in the video. We ... well, we\u2019ll let you formulate your own opinion on that. Your browser does not support HTML5 video. The first time around, we watched this video in an incredulous stupor. What\u2019s Barbie doing talking about Portal? we asked. (We still can\u2019t wrap our heads around this whole vlogging thing of hers, too.) But for Barbie and her legions of viewers, it\u2019s no big deal that she\u2019s into cosplay. She\u2019s nonchalant about her love of P ortal . It\u2019s as if Barbie\u2019s saying that, hey, it\u2019s one of the best video games of all time; why wouldn\u2019t she like it? When thinking about the ramifications of Barbie pontificating on her affection for a game that may not have broken through to mainstream preteen audiences, we start to feel less baffled by it. Barbie\u2019s not the most insightful or interesting girl, but we\u2019ll give her props for wearing her love of cosplay with pride. It\u2019s a smart play on manufacturer Mattel\u2019s part to have Barbie engage her audience on YouTube, and the video blog format is a crafty way to go about doing just that. The first vlog was released on Jan. 2, 2000 . It starred blogger Adam Kontras and focused on his cross-country move to Los Angeles. It was a way to keep his friends and family informed about his trip, which he was also simultaneously blogging about, and use emerging online platforms as a way to integrate video. Fast forward 17 years, and vlogging is a touchstone of YouTube. Its biggest personalities, from Lilly Singh to PewDiePie , all maintain their own vlogs as a way of giving fans a look into their personal lives. It\u2019s a way to show their audience where they live, what their day-to-day life looks like and supply them with a little bit more information about themselves. While we don\u2019t necessarily appreciate Barbie\u2019s vlog, as people who are clearly not her intended audience, it\u2019s also a perfect example of why the format works. The first Barbie doll was released in 1959. Since that fateful toy fair in New York City where she was introduced, Barbie has spawned an empire that consists of dolls, books, movies, TV shows, crossover specials and an annual convention. But as the internet became a bigger presence in our lives, essentially dominating any other type of medium, Barbie needed to adapt to her changing surroundings. Enter Barbie\u2019s vlog. Barbie\u2019s first vlog was released in June 2015, and like other YouTube personalities, Barbie used the video as a way to introduce some unknown facts about herself. Just as with the cosplay video, we were caught between laughing at the concept of Barbie having a vlog in the first place and realizing that we were actually learning facts about Barbie that we never knew. For example: Barbie moved to Malibu, California from Minnesota when she was eight and is scared of both spiders and soda. We learned that she loves to play \u201cWhat If?\u201d with her siblings and talk about the cool things they want to invent. We learned that her favorite subjects are science \u2014 particularly chemistry \u2014 and English. By the end of the five-minute video, we had learned more about Barbie than we ever had before. For the young girls and boys growing up in the age of YouTube videos and smartphones, any information they want is at their fingertips and one URL away. Barbie\u2019s fans today are going to be spending the majority of their time on YouTube, probably going back and forth between the California doll\u2019s blogs and Let\u2019s Play Minecraft videos. Vlogging, and bringing the Barbie empire to YouTube in general, isn\u2019t just one of the smarter decisions the company could have made to keep her relevant \u2014 it was the only one. As Barbie matures, there has been a push from publisher Mattel to focus more on what Barbie could be aside from a beautiful, blonde woman. She\u2019s been an engineer, a firefighter, a judge and most recently, a game developer . There\u2019s a large push for Barbie to encourage young girls to pursue STEM careers and learn about science and math in school. Connecting with kids via vlogs, and focusing on both video games and science while doing so, is just another way to continue that philosophy. Barbie\u2019s vlog is one of the weirdest channels on YouTube, but it\u2019s also one of the most uplifting series available to both kids and adults. You keep doing you, Barbie. But maybe cool it on the dabbing. (Also, take it from us: Soda is definitely not scary.)

People have said the show has triggered their own vulnerabilities and made them consider whether suicide is a possible option for them,\" Douglas said. \nShe added that research shows that \u201cif you talk about suicide harmfully, it will lead to further harm. Its far more likely for young people to connect with this content and think its the answer for them\". \nHeadspace is increasing its messaging about assistance available to schools, parents and teens because the show included \u201cvery confronting and graphic messaging and imagery inclusive of suicide method and means\u201d, against clearly established local media guidelines. In addition, the series is one of Netflix\u2019s most watched shows in Australia this year, Douglas said. \nMindframe, a national mental health initiative funded the Australian government\u2019s National Suicide Prevention Program, has developed non-enforceable guidelines on safe and accurate portrayal of suicide, and, for the most part, Australian journalists, broadcasters and media companies and follow those guidelines. \n\u201cThere is a responsibility for broadcasters to know what they are showing and the impact that certain content can have on an audience \u2013 and on a young audience in particular,\u201d Douglas\u2019 colleague Dr Steven Leicester added. \nNetflix and the producers have not taken that responsibility seriously enough according to Jaelea Skehan, director of Mindframe. \nSkehan criticized the series, which she has seen in full, in a statement titled 6 Reasons Six Reasons Why I'm concerned about a TV series . Those reasons include: \u201cthe suicide scene is graphic and that\u2019s not OK, it sends the wrong messages about suicide risk and the show does nothing to encourage help-seeking and shows adults as a species to be avoided at all costs\u201d. \nNetflix has established a website allied to the show which lists Crisis Helplines in 35 countries in which the series air."}, {"crawled": "2017-04-19T18:38:36.000+03:00", "title": "Great Job, Internet!: College kids are getting extremely good at wasting time in class", "external_links": [], "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "2aa71cb1eb96d75d2c5ac45cec7ed346e8955ceb", "author": "Chris Breault", "thread": {"section_title": "The A.V.

Chris Ship: Rare insight into Prince Harry's private world \nSorry, this content isn't available on your device. \nSpeaking from Kensington Palace to Lady Gaga in her Hollywood home, William stressed the importance of smashing the stigma around talking about mental health. \n\"It's time that everyone speaks up and really feels very normal about mental health, it's the same as physical health,\" he said. \n\"Everybody has mental health and we shouldn't be ashamed of it and just having a conversation with a friend or family member can really make such a difference.\" \nHe said many of the issues he had seen from his work with veterans, homelessness and addiction charities stemmed from mental health issues. \nAnd the prince also praised the Poker Face singer for her bravery in revealing that she lives with post-traumatic stress disorder.

Buteau, who has had parts in Broad City and Key and Peele , will play Wayans' girlfriend, Nancy. She is described as an opinionated and outspoken woman who knows what she wants and liberally uses technology to get it. \nThe pilot, which was picked up by FX in August after a multiple-network bidding war, takes place in a future where where artificial intelligence surpasses human intelligence, resulting in profound changes to society. Wayans' lead character of Doug is a guy who loves to be in the moment and is often dressed in Yeezy street wear \u2014 and contrary to some, he's happily reliant on AI. \nThe project is based on an original idea from Silicon Valley 's Sonny Lee, who will pen the script for the comedy and executive produce alongside Rogen and Goldberg via their production company Point Grey. \nIf Singularity is ordered to series, it would be Rogen and Goldberg's third television project, following AMC's comic book adaptation Preacher and Hulu's upcoming series Future Man , starring Josh Hutcherson. \nButeau is repped by CAA, Mosaic and Bradley Garrett at Cohen Gardner.

Posted on Share \nBuzzFeed Health spoke with three experts \u2014 Dr. Filamer Kabigting , assistant professor of dermatology at Columbia University Medical Center, Dr. Rachel Miest , Minnesota-based dermatologist with Mayo Clinic, and Dr. Evan Rieder , assistant professor of Dermatology at NYU Langone Medical Center \u2014 to learn more about pubic hair and best practices for grooming, whether you like your pubes au natural, nonexistent, or somewhere in between. \nHere are all the interesting things they had to say. 1. Pubic hair acts as a cushion for your genitals and reduces friction when you're having sex. \n\"Pubic hair acts like a defensive barrier between you and the things you come into contact with,\" Rieder says. \"It also protects against friction, preventing abrasions and injury of the surrounding skin.\" 2. And it can potentially help protect you from bacterial infections and viruses during skin-to-skin contact. Share \n\"Its presence does prevent foreign particles, such as bacteria, from not only infecting the skin, but also from entering the body,\" Miest says. \"So pubic hair does potentially serve as a protective mechanism for STIs, and hair removal does put us at a higher risk for those infections, like herpes, HPV, and gonorrhea.\" That's not to say that going bare is going to cause an STI, but if your grooming method leaves you with abrasions or tears in the skin, it's possible an infection can enter the body this way. \nShe adds that skin, in general, harbors bacteria and viruses, and pubic hair can help prevent them from spreading to others during sexual contact. 3. It's called pubic hair because of where it grows: in the lower part of the abdomen just above the genitals, aka the pubis region. Share \n\"Anatomically that region is called the pubis, which is why it\u2019s called pubic hair,\" Kabigting says. 4. Pubic hair transplants are a real thing in some places where having more pubic hair is seen as a sign of fertility and attractiveness. Share \n\"Dermatologists and plastic surgeons are performing pubic hair transplants in the US too, but not in great quantity,\" Rieder says. \"South Koreans see pubic hair as attractive, and they're usually on the forefront of cosmetic dermatology, coming up with innovations years before new products and techniques reach America.\" 5. And yes, pubic wigs (aka merkins) are a thing . Share \n\"They are definitely a niche interest, but they do exist,\" Rieder says. \"Before the advent of penicillin (the gold standard for the treatment of syphilis), prostitutes would wear merkins to cover up the appearance of sexually transmitted infections. They've also reportedly been used on stage for actors who were playing roles of the opposite sex.\" 6. It's a myth that when you shave, your pubic hair will grow in thicker. Share \n\"When a new hair comes in, it's actually tapered at the end like a javelin, making the hair look like it's thinner,\" Rieder says. \"And when you shave, you cut off that tapered end, getting a jagged, blunt tip that makes it look like the hair is growing in thicker.\" \nKabigting says the only way to actually make a pubic hair grow in thinner is by getting laser hair removal treatment. 7. At a certain length (usually relatively short but it's different for everyone) your pubic hair will stop growing. Share \n\"Every hair that we have has three specific stages during its life cycle: growth, rest, and ultimately shedding , which can be different lengths of time for every individual and every area of their body,\" Miest explains. \"And in most cases your pubic hair is like your eyelash hairs in that it will grow to a short length and then fall out on its own.\" \nThe length your hair will grow to is determined by genetics (think about how some people just have longer eyelashes than others), so you don\u2019t need to worry about having to throw it in a ponytail or braid it if you decide to go au natural. 8. Your pubic hair can be a completely different color than the hair on the rest of your body. Share \n\"Melanin is a protein that gives hair its color and it's found in different quantities in different areas of the body,\" Rieder says. \"For many people, there is little variation, but for others, the color of the scalp, underarm, and pubic hair is not always the same.\" 9. Evolutionarily speaking, pubic hair starting to come in signals that puberty and sexual maturation are on their way. Share \n\"Pubic hair begins growing in when people start to mature and go through puberty,\" Rieder says. \"It's a sign that someone is able to start procreating, which makes sense since pubic hair's supposed main purpose is to protect the genitals during sex.\" 10. Pubes can thin out with age, and some people go completely bald in their genital region. Share \nSome thinning of the body hair is common with age, but Rieder says that for women, pubic balding or thinning can sometimes be due to hormonal imbalances associated with menopause. \nThere are also several medications and medical conditions that can cause pubic hair loss in childhood, adolescence, and early adulthood, he says. If you're experiencing pubic hair loss, definitely let your doctor know. 11. According to all three experts, grooming habits are culturally-specific, and within the past few decades people in the US have been grooming their pubes more frequently than in the past. Share \n\"Grooming habits are very cultural and are in some ways influenced by fashion trends and the media,\" Kabigting says. \"There has been a big shift towards grooming pubic hair here, and the clients I see say it's because of a range of reasons from swimwear trends, to what's seen in movies and TV shows, to what's being done in the pornography industry.\" \nHe also says some people just like the way shaved genitals look and feel and that it sometimes has nothing to do with outside influence. 12. A 2016 study showed that most women who groomed their pubic hair did so for \"hygienic purposes\" but actually, it's more hygienic to have pubes. Share \n\"People believe that it\u2019s more hygienic to shave their pubic hair, so they make it a habit, especially if there\u2019s a chance they'll be having sex or oral sex, because they want to be 'clean' for their partner,\" Kabigting says. \"It's not the hair, but the genitals and the folds of the skin on the genitals that can be a good breeding ground for bacteria.\" \nHe says that as long as you're showering and practicing good hygiene, your pubic hair isn't going to be a hellish petri dish of infectious bacteria. 13. Also, people in the US who are younger or have sex regularly seem more likely to be concerned with grooming their pubes. Share \nIn one study , the majority of men who reported grooming said they did so as preparation for sex, and in another study the most common motivation for women who groomed their pubic hair was hygiene. In both studies, younger respondents were more likely to groom. \n\"In my experience with clients, people stop shaving when they get older because shaving is tedious and they just don\u2019t care about maintaining it as much anymore,\" Kabigting says. 14. Grooming your pubes can cause irritation because it's basically microscopically wounding your skin. Share \nMiest says waxing or plucking your pubic hair is going to cause microscopic damage because you're forcibly removing the hair from its follicle. And shaving can cause the same thing if you're using a blade that isn't sharp enough and isn't sterile (which, let's be honest, most of ones we're using probably aren't) and if you're usually shaving against the grain to get as much of the hair as possible. \nSo, if you are going to get rid of your pubes, do the best you can to minimize the stuff that causes irritation. Here are some ways to make your next Brazilian wax less terrible, for example. And if you're getting it done professionally, make sure you're going to someone who can meet whatever specific needs you might have around the sensitivity of your skin, the products you like, etc. \nMiest recommends that right after you shave, wax, or remove your pubes, you keep the area clean and dry and use a topical steroid cream to reduce inflammation. Don't scrub the area, and consider taking a break from working out because the added friction can cause irritation. 15. Having small abrasions and a super irritated crotch post hair-removal makes you more susceptible to inflammation and bacterial infection."}, {"crawled": "2017-04-20T07:28:11.000+03:00", "title": "The First Trailer For Marvel's 'Cloak & Dagger' Series Is Here | moviepilot.com", "external_links": [], "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "7398e02e2c728c30f6e52ba9f9b245a06f61483f", "author": "Antonio Ferme", "thread": {"section_title": "", "title": "The First Trailer For Marvel's 'Cloak & Dagger' Series Is Here | moviepilot.com", "site_full": "moviepilot.com", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 896, "likes": 896}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "title_full": "The First Trailer For Marvel's 'Cloak & Dagger' Series Is Here | moviepilot.com", "site_type": "news", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4nXoT4.Lbrg8JVrnUbdedOHPHeJw_mK4NQ_TS.Rqk17XF.c1.x4j1hcJ8.TXbZjCqTKpELt96pu4Jiokw.RtTlla2m1A3JgY-", "uuid": "7398e02e2c728c30f6e52ba9f9b245a06f61483f", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "domain_rank": 2997, "spam_score": 0.161, "country": "US", "site": "moviepilot.com", "main_image": "https://images.moviepilot.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_630,q_auto:best,w_1200/avx97jjfci1j2c5knhgq.jpg", "site_section": "", "published": "2017-04-20T00:50:00.000+03:00", "performance_score": 8, "site_categories": []}, "highlightText": "", "rating": null, "ord_in_thread": 0, "entities": {"persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "carl lundstedt"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "connors"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "james saito"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "j.d. evermore"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "tyrone"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "holt"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "gloria reuben"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "liam"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "tyrone johnson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "aubrey joseph"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "melissa bowen"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "miles mussenden"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "tandy bowen"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "joseph"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "bernard sanjo"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "antonio ferme"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "michael johnson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "andrea roth"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "roxxon"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "adina johnson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "grey"}], "locations": [], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "marvel"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cloak & dagger"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cw"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "creators.co i'm"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "olivia holt"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "tandy"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "bloodline"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "marvel comics"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS4nXoT4.Lbrg8JVrnUbdedOHPHeJw_mK4NQ_TS.Rqk17XF.c1.x4j1hcJ8.TXbZjCqTKpELt96pu4Jiokw.RtTlla2m1A3JgY-", "published": "2017-04-20T00:50:00.000+03:00", "text": "Marvel Releases The Powerful First Trailer For Its Upcoming 'Cloak and Dagger' TV Series April 19, 2017 at 04:50PM By Antonio Ferme , writer at creators.co [Credit: Marvel Comics] By Antonio Ferme , writer at Creators.co I'm a high school student who gets paid to write about movies and TV. Facebook: antoniojferme Twitter: antonio_Ferme [email protected] \nThis week has been packed full of #Marvel news. Captain Marvel found its directing duo , the first press screenings for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 hit , the New Warriors series characters revealed , and now, the first trailer for its upcoming #CloakandDagger TV series has officially been released. First Trailer For 'Cloak And Dagger' Has Hit The Web \nThis trailer is more like an extended sneak peak, but it did manage to give us a general idea of what the new series will be about. For those unfamiliar with the story in the #comicbooks , this is a coming-of-age drama revolving around two troubled teenagers, Tandy and Tyrone, who bump into each other, gain super powers, and go on the run. As the trailer also hinted at, the two will find a love for one another during the first season. Is that Roxxon? [Credit: Freeform] \nJust like the CW, Freeform is the home of many dramas and now, with Cloak & Dagger , Freeform can make the #Marvel series a flagship, which is why they decided to drop a teaser already, though the show isn't set to come out next year. Even know the show will focus on drama, we shouldn't be too worried as the CW shows have shown the world how you can mix drama into a YA-oriented superhero show in good ways. \nThe description of the show gives us some more insight on what to expect: \nCloak & Dagger is a coming-of-age series based on the beloved Marvel characters. Tandy Bowen (Olivia Holt) and Tyrone Johnson (Aubrey Joseph) come from starkly different backgrounds, each growing up with a secret they never dared share with another soul. \nOnce a privileged little girl, Tandy Bowen watched as her family was destroyed by a disastrous storm that uprooted her life. Now in her late teens, an unexpected encounter with a boy named Tyrone sparks a life changing event. \nYoung Tyrone Johnson wanted nothing more than to prove he was fearless. But when everything he held close was taken away, life taught Tyrone to be afraid. Now older and more sheltered, Tyrone closes himself off. But when he meets a girl named Tandy his life changes forever. Credit: Marvel \nBesides Holt and Joseph, the cast also includes Andrea Roth ( Blue Bloods ) as Melissa Bowen, Tandy\u2019s mom; Gloria Reuben ( ER ) as Tyrone\u2019s mother, Adina Johnson; Miles Mussenden ( Bloodline ) as Tyrone\u2019s father, Michael Johnson; Carl Lundstedt ( Grey\u2019s Anatomy ) as Liam, Tandy\u2019s partner in crime; James Saito ( Life of Pi ) as Dr. Bernard Sanjo, and J.D. Evermore ( The Walking Dead ) as Detective Connors. \nSee also: "}, {"crawled": "2017-04-18T23:54:11.000+03:00", "title": "Etan Patz Killer Sentenced To 25 Years To Life", "external_links": [], "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "8805c424535fae425dacb69d259b9376fc7d23c8", "author": "Amy Held", "thread": {"section_title": "News : NPR", "title": "Etan Patz Killer Sentenced To 25 Years To Life", "site_full": "www.npr.org", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 895, "likes": 895}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "title_full": "Etan Patz Killer Sentenced To 25 Years To Life", "site_type": "news", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_4nDdOFsceBm10CsiyEBH2aP9kDu7m3KANydcQYmfGbxR.71eDTG5Y4HPX2grm5qs70uSBdlvm6hLhkTh2RLia6NFiDMO1U.AbdOCDa2cUWeeMujePXMpJ16_zGHMH4W3Zfd6cAl1wjA--", "uuid": "8805c424535fae425dacb69d259b9376fc7d23c8", "participants_count": 1, "replies_count": 0, "domain_rank": 495, "spam_score": 0.0, "country": "US", "site": "npr.org", "main_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/04/18/ap_17096722694877_wide-fe6e66a6d6b90f05c4bf4e19c9e3932f1373a9e1.jpg?s=1400", "site_section": "http://mobile.kcfr.org//rss/rss.php?id=1002", "published": "2017-04-18T23:54:11.000+03:00", "performance_score": 8, "site_categories": []}, "highlightText": "", "rating": null, "ord_in_thread": 0, "entities": {"persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "etan patz"}, {"sentiment": "neutral", "name": "amy held  pedro hernandez"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "patz"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "hernandez"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "louis lanzano/ap"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "louis lanzano/ap  pedro hernandez"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "louis lanzano/ap pedro hernandez"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "manhattan"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "new york"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "soho"}], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_4nDdOFsceBm10CsiyEBH2aP9kDu7m3KANydcQYmfGbxR.71eDTG5Y4HPX2grm5qs70uSBdlvm6hLhkTh2RLia6NFiDMO1U.AbdOCDa2cUWeeMujePXMpJ16_zGHMH4W3Zfd6cAl1wjA--", "published": "2017-04-18T23:54:11.000+03:00", "text": "Enlarge this image Pedro Hernandez appears in Manhattan criminal court on Nov. 15, 2012, in New York.

He was sentenced Tuesday to 25 years to life in the killing of Etan Patz.\nLouis Lanzano/AP Pedro Hernandez was sentenced Tuesday to 25 years to life in prison for killing Etan Patz. The 56-year-old former store clerk was also given 25 years to life for kidnapping, with both sentences to run concurrently.\nIt was a different time when the 6-year-old walked alone to catch the school bus in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood on May 25, 1979. His disappearance sparked decades of investigation and helped create a generation of wary parents.\nHernandez confessed to the murder in 2012, saying he lured the little boy with the promise of a soda. He said once he got the child into the basement of the neighborhood store where Hernandez worked, he choked him and left his body in a box on the curb.\nPatz's body has never been found. Hernandez's lawyers argued their client is mentally ill and made false confessions under police pressure.\nA previous trial for Hernandez ended in a mistrial in 2015.

The latest developments are as follows: President Trump has sent two more nuclear-capable warships, USS Ronald Reagan and USS Nimitz, to follow the one he deployed several days ago, which was the USS Carl Vinson, to the Korean Peninsula; Vice President Mike Pence, who\u2019s currently in Asia conducting meetings with world leaders (minus one Kim Jong-un), is talking tough with warnings to North Korea; Russia and China are calling for restraint; China has just tried out a new missile destroyer; and Pyongyang continues to chide warnings and pleas whilst threatening nuclear war. USS Ronald Reagan & USS Nimitz \nThese two warships have been deployed to join the USS Carl Vinson sent out last week in the direction of the Korean Peninsula, Daily Mail has reported. All three ships have the capacity to store 90 aircraft comprised of both planes and helicopters. Carl Vinson requires a crew of over 6,000 to operate, while Ronald Reagan and Nimitz require a few hundred less than that. The USS Ronald Reagan pictured coming into Hong Kong on March 7, 2007. [Image by Kin Cheung/AP Images] \nAccording to Naval Technology , the USS Nimitz, commissioned in 1975, is the oldest of the three warships, as well as the first of its kind, as the USS Ronald Reagan and USS Carl Vinson are of the Nimitz Class of warships. Reagan is the newest ship of this group, commissioned in 2003. Carl Vinson became an official aircraft carrier in 1982. USS Nimitz pictured off the coast of Japan on August 24, 2009.

Pence Gets Stern With North Korea \nDuring a trip in Asia to speak with leaders of the region, Vice President Mike Pence made use of stern rhetoric directed toward unhinged North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, a ruler who acts all too happy to threaten the United States and the rest of the world with his nuclear arsenal on a regular basis. These threats have carried more weight in recent weeks, as President Donald Trump has gone to lengths to make it clear he\u2019s not the type of decision-maker his predecessor Barack Obama was. \nDuring a press conference in South Korea, Pence referred to the lengths the president has taken recently in Syria and Afghanistan to illustrate his point on what the U.S. is capable of and willing to do if Jong-un crosses the line. \nThe Irish Examiner spoke with North Korean citizens following the VP\u2019s comments, and it was reported that by their words and behavior, it appears the people under Kim Jong-un\u2019s rule are unafraid of a nuclear war with the United States. North Korean citizens, shown here under the portraits of Kim Jong-un\u2019s father and grandfather, seem largely unbothered by the prospect of nuclear war, say journalists. [Image by Wong Maye-E/AP Images] \n\u201c\u2026in Pyongyang, where war would mean untold horrors, where neighbourhoods could be reduced to rubble and tens of thousands of civilians could be killed, few people seem to care much at all.\u201d \nNorth Koreans reportedly have the utmost confidence in their leader, despite what war, whether it be World War 3 or that of another variety, would likely mean for them. \nJong-un has yet to relent on talk of his nuclear war capabilities. Directives For Calm \nAfter President Trump dropped the \u201cMother of All Bombs\u201d onto a network of interconnected cave tunnels used by ISIS operatives in Afghanistan, Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has his own reasons to be frustrated with the U.S., made public a request for restraint , as reported by The Sun . \n\u201cWe call all countries for restraint, we call all the countries to refrain from any actions that could amount to provocative steps.\u201d \nNot long after Putin\u2019s statement, the Foreign Minister of China followed the Kremlin\u2019s lead by issuing his own plea for world leaders to check themselves before doing anything they could one day regret.

[Image by Lintao Zhang/Getty Images] \nIf Russia and China are worried about explosive ramifications between the United States and North Korea, should the rest of the world be concerned as well? China Tries Out Missile Destroyer \nDaily Mail has reported that China recently tried out a new addition to their war arsenal called Xining, described as a \u201cguided-missile destroyer.\u201d Given Kim Jong-un\u2019s intent on testing nuclear missiles, it\u2019s probably not a coincidence China is conducting their own military preparations. \n\u201cThe vessel is integrated with \u2018many new types of weaponry\u2019, including main artillery on the deck, anti-aircraft and anti-missile close-in weapon system, torpedo and missile.\u201d \nThe Chinese government made video footage of the tests, which were conducted on the Yellow Sea, available to watch via the China Central Television Station (CCTV).

The missile exploded seconds after takeoff. Kim Jong-un. [Image by Wong Maye-E/AP Images] \nThe gaffe, however, has not slowed Kim Jong-un down . Quite the opposite, as the dictator has promised to continue conducting missile tests despite warnings from the U.S. to take action in response to more tests. BBC spoke with an official of the North Korean Foreign Ministry on Monday, and this person said that the missile tests should be expected every week, and if Washington takes it upon themselves to respond aggressively, they should be prepared for nuclear ramifications. \nThis could be a problem, as it\u2019s also been reported that American army officials are ruminating over whether or not they should directly interfere with additional missile tests coming out of Pyongyang.

However, cutthroat trout populations are threatened by hybridization from mating with rainbow trout. Jonny Armstrong/USGS hide caption toggle caption Jonny Armstrong/USGS Native westslope cutthroat trout swim in the north fork of the Flathead River in northwestern Montana. However, cutthroat trout populations are threatened by hybridization from mating with rainbow trout. Jonny Armstrong/USGS \nThere's an unplanned experiment going on in the northern Rocky Mountains. What's happening is that spring is arriving earlier, and it's generally warmer and drier than usual. And that's messing with some of the fish that live there. \nThe fish is the iconic cutthroat trout. It's a native North American fish that thrives in cold, small streams. Explorer Meriwether Lewis of Lewis and Clark Expedition fame was among the first European-Americans to catch this spangly, spotted fish. He used deer spleen as bait. \nIt's relative rarity now makes it a favorite for catch-and-release anglers. But biologists have now found that it's in danger. The much more common rainbow trout is invading cutthroat streams and mating with the native fish. Ecologist Clint Muhlfeld says that creates hybrids. \n\"It jumbles up the genes that are linked to the locally adapted traits that these fish have evolved with,\" says Muhlfeld, who's with the U.S. Geological Survey and the University of Montana's Flathead Lake Biological Station. \nThose traits have allowed cutthroats to survive through millennia in cold northern streams. And cold streams were thought to protect them from rainbows, which prefer warmer water. \nBut climate change is warming many high-altitude streams, and they frequently have less water, another change that favors rainbows. So they're moving in. \nMuhlfeld says that when rainbows and cutthroats breed, the resulting hybrids are feeble \u2014 \"less fit,\" in biological terms. \"They don't survive as well as the native fish,\" he says. And hybrids that do survive continue to make more hybrids; there's no going back to making cutthroats again. \nWriting in the journal Global Change Biology , Muhlfeld and a team of scientists from several research institutions studied fish in hundreds of locations in the northern Rockies. Hybridization was widespread. It was most common in places where fish and game departments have introduced rainbow trout, a practice that goes back to the 19th century. \nSome states are trying to solve the problem by getting rid of rainbow trout. That might not please some anglers, but Muhlfeld says the cutthroat species could disappear otherwise. \n\"There are so many places around the world where you can go catch a rainbow trout,\" he says; it's been introduced all over the world. \"There's very few places where you can actually go and catch a native fish that's been around for thousands and thousands of years. \n\"Extinction is permanent. Once the native genomes and adaptive traits are gone, they are gone forever.\""}, {"crawled": "2017-04-20T04:37:22.000+03:00", "title": "Don Cheadle Talks Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cDNA.\u201d Video, Being the Original Kung Fu Kenny", "external_links": [], "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "d02433ef9ecd6eeb9f0fc5a0226fd1cb711f7bc1", "author": "Marc Hogan and Evan Minsker", "thread": {"section_title": "Latest News - Pitchfork", "title": "Don Cheadle Talks Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cDNA.\u201d Video, Being the Original Kung Fu Kenny", "site_full": "pitchfork.com", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 2}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4824}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 888, "likes": 888}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "title_full": "Don Cheadle Talks Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cDNA.\u201d Video, Being the Original Kung Fu Kenny", "site_type": "news", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKxMDCUoSOBCtrYvXEGvow8jrIzLYosclmBBXqmfTpKcx6EIAvgZA0qlHZ3RvIygHnsqqR8.406nGMZM9Fmqyrpa.u4xdA5sBlkuqxM6tGfp169VtbJMmOr.BLtxJT7yABsQpbaOlyz6dQ--", "uuid": "d02433ef9ecd6eeb9f0fc5a0226fd1cb711f7bc1", "participants_count": 1, "replies_count": 0, "domain_rank": 2531, "spam_score": 0.0, "country": "US", "site": "pitchfork.com", "main_image": "", "site_section": "http://pitchfork.com/rss/news/", "published": "2017-04-20T04:37:22.000+03:00", "performance_score": 8, "site_categories": []}, "highlightText": "", "rating": null, "ord_in_thread": 0, "entities": {"persons": [{"sentiment": "neutral", "name": "don cheadle"}, {"sentiment": "neutral", "name": "kendrick lamar"}, {"sentiment": "neutral", "name": "kenny don cheadle"}, {"sentiment": "neutral", "name": "kenny"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kung fu kenny"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "geraldo"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "christian sands"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "rob"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "pitchfork"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "christian mcbride"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "nabil"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cheadle"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "joseph campbell"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "robert glasper"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "wynton [marsalis"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "walter smith iii"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "miles ahead"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kendrick"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dre"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kamasi washington"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "kung fu kenny"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "coachella"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kendrick"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kamasi washington"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "grammys"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "little homies"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/8HG_hanVOKxMDCUoSOBCtrYvXEGvow8jrIzLYosclmBBXqmfTpKcx6EIAvgZA0qlHZ3RvIygHnsqqR8.406nGMZM9Fmqyrpa.u4xdA5sBlkuqxM6tGfp169VtbJMmOr.BLtxJT7yABsQpbaOlyz6dQ--", "published": "2017-04-20T04:37:22.000+03:00", "text": "Don Cheadle Talks Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cDNA.\u201d Video, Being the Original Kung Fu Kenny The actor on conversations with Kendrick, improvised dialogue, belatedly understanding the Rush Hour 2 reference Kendrick Lamar \nYesterday, after releasing his new album DAMN. and delivering a huge headlining set at Coachella, Kendrick Lamar dropped the stunning new video for \u201c DNA. \u201d The clip, directed by Nabil and the Little Homies, stars Don Cheadle as a police officer who interrogates Kendrick before rapping the song. Throughout the video, Kendrick is dressed in a Kung Fu Kenny costume\u2014an homage to Cheadle\u2019s character from the 2001 movie Rush Hour 2 . Today, Cheadle spoke to Pitchfork over the phone about his appearance in the video, how he had two days to learn the lyrics, the ad-libbed dialogue from the video, his text conversations with Kendrick, the time he offered Kendrick an acting job, and how he only just figured out that he\u2019s the inspiration behind Kung Fu Kenny. \nPitchfork: You obviously learned the trumpet for your portrayal of Miles Davis in last year's biopic Miles Ahead. How did you prepare to rap in a Kendrick video? \nDon Cheadle: Well, it was a very different process. I didn\u2019t have to figure out how to play anything like I did for Miles Ahead .

Kendrick just hit me out of the blue and just said, \u201cHey man, I\u2019m going to do this video, do you wanna be in it?\u201d And I said, \u201cYeah, sure.\u201d And then he said, \u201cDo you want to know what the part is?\u201d He was like, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re gonna come in and play a cop, and you\u2019re interrogating me, and then you\u2019re just gonna spit my rap.\u201d \nI was like, \u201cUh OK, you know you\u2019re like the best rapper in the world, so what are you talking about.\u201d He sent me the lyrics and was like, \u201cYou just have to get this much of it down,\u201d which was like half of it [ laughs ]. I was like, \u201cAre you gonna have a teleprompter?\u201d And he said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s gonna be fine.\u201d \nSo I crammed like we have to do as actors. It\u2019s tricky, because it\u2019s not a linear process. His thought process is not linear. That was probably the trickiest part of it\u2014to figure out how thoughts led to each other. As a human being, he\u2019s pretty normal and straight ahead, but when you listen to his rhymes, he\u2019s constructing ideas in ways that are not immediately understandable. It takes a deep dive to kind of figure out why one verse creates the other verse and what it comes out of and all of that. So it\u2019s tricky to memorize because it\u2019s so specific to the way he thinks. But then when we got in there, we really just started playing. We just started improvising, really. \nIt\u2019s crazy that you only had two days. I wondered if you had this album weeks before everybody. \nNo. I literally had that song. They sent me that and said, \u201cCan you do it?\u201d And they sent me a couple of video clips of him literally just sitting in a trailer, just kind of moving. They said, \u201cWe want you to get his movements, \u2019cause you\u2019re kind of going to be mirroring him at some point.\u201d So they sent me a couple clips of the way he moved and him doing the rhyme, just really casual and laid back. And then we showed up and it happened really fast because they had the entire rest of that video they had to shoot with cars and all of that stuff. So we just kind of improv\u2019d it. The cameras moved around a lot. Nabil, who directed it, was just really clever about how to cover it. We did it like five or six times and that was it. \nThe part where you ask if he knows what \u201cDNA\u201d stands for\u2014was that something you came up with or was that Kendrick? \nThat was me. He just said, \u201cYou\u2019re a cop, and you\u2019re going to be messing with him and getting in his face. So just fuck with him.\u201d So I said, \u201cOK, well this would be a pretty fucked up thing to say\u201d [ laughs ]. So I just improv\u2019d all the dialogue, everything I said. I did it once, and after we finished it, Kendrick was like, \u201cYeah, say that again. Say exactly that. Do that one again.\u201d \nDid you see that Geraldo criticized Kendrick again ? \nKendrick sent that to me. It\u2019s just hilarious. It\u2019s like, \u201cWow dude, you don\u2019t have anything better to do? That\u2019s not your lane, bro.\u201d \nYou introduced Kendrick\u2019s amazing performance at the Grammys last year. What was it like being right there? \nIt was amazing, and again, it was a complete surprise. I was walking the red carpet and everybody was saying, \u201cHave you seen it? Do you know what he\u2019s going to do?\u201d And I was like, \u201cNo.\u201d It did not disappoint. \nRight before I announced it, they stuck me somewhere\u2014I had to go stand somewhere before I walked on stage\u2014and Robert Glasper just happened to be standing in front of me. Neither one of us knew, and as soon as it was over, he just turned around and looked at me, and we just stared at each other for 10 seconds. Like, \u201cWhat did we just see?\u201d Incredible. \nDid you already know Kendrick before then? \nDre had connected us because I wanted to use Kendrick in some project I was doing\u2014his music, for sure. I maybe wanted him to try his hand at acting, which he was very reticent to do at that time. He didn\u2019t feel like that was his lane and said he wasn\u2019t ready. I really appreciated that, because a lot of people are like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll do it,\u201d just because they want that shine. He was like, \u201cNah, I don\u2019t do anything unless I know I can do it.\u201d \nBut we just stayed in touch from that point on. We texted, \u201cHey what\u2019s happening,\u201d he\u2019s like, \u201coh I\u2019m on tour, I\u2019m working on this music.\u201d I\u2019d be somewhere and I\u2019d get a text just out of the blue saying, \u201cwhat\u2019s up big bro, what\u2019s happening.\u201d So we just kind of stayed in touch like that over a couple years, and then a month ago, he said, \u201cOh I\u2019m gonna do this video, do you wanna do it?\u201d \nWhat\u2019s your take on the second half of the video? It shows this much more varied life than Geraldo or whoever is saying Kendrick represents. What\u2019s your take on what the video means? \nI loved it. I love the whole video. Like I said, to me, he is real. He\u2019s just real and straight-up and honest and truthful and generous to the degree that he lets you in. He lets you see the cracks in the armor. He lets you see his insecurities and all that stuff. It\u2019s just rare to have any kind of artist do that\u2014especially a hip-hop artist. He\u2019s kind of the anti-hip-hop artist in that way. \nWhat thoughts do you have about the rest of the album? \nI haven\u2019t heard it! I didn\u2019t even know that I was the Kung Fu Kenny model. I didn\u2019t know that until the next day. He got that from my character in Rush Hour 2 . He was like, \u201cDuh!\u201d He texted me like, \u201cDude are you serious? You didn\u2019t know that?\u201d I totally forgot about that. I\u2019ve been working too long, I didn\u2019t even remember that. \nHe\u2019s dressed like your character, right? \nYes! When he hit me, before the video, he said, \u201cThe video, it\u2019s gonna be here, and I\u2019ve got a little surprise for you.\u201d I was like, \u201cCool.\u201d So I showed up, I did the thing, then I left, and I did not put it together. Then I went to Coachella and saw him perform, and I saw the video before the thing and still didn\u2019t figure it out. And then I went on Twitter and someone had randomly tweeted, \u201cDon Cheadle is the original Kung Fu Kenny.\u201d I went, \u201cWait a minute, I did play a character named Kenny who did kung fu and spoke Chinese.\u201d \nAnd I texted Kendrick and was like, \u201cHey man, am I the inspiration for Kung Fu Kenny? Because I\u2019m going to say I am whether I am or not.\u201d He was like, \u201cFam, that was the surprise. So, surprise!\u201d Oh shit! I feel stupid now. \nI wonder what he was thinking the whole two days when we were together and I hadn\u2019t said anything about it. He was like, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with this dude? Is he senile? Does he hate it? Is he not a fan?\u201d It was obvious. Now, when you say it, it\u2019s obvious. \nYou talked about Kendrick and Kamasi Washington while you did press for Miles Ahead , and you worked with Robert Glasper. How do you find new music? \nThrough them. It\u2019s kind of like how Joseph Campbell talked about how he became a scholar. I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m a scholar, but he\u2019d read all the people he liked and then he\u2019d go and read all the people that they read. Then he\u2019d read that person and see who that person read. That\u2019s kind of how it is. I look at the people that Rob has worked with. You look at the tracks and see who the people are. You find them and what their music is and who they\u2019ve worked with. It just kind of works like that. Christian Sands, Christian McBride, Walter Smith III, Kamasi Washington\u2014all these young cats that are really doing it now. And the guys who have still been doing for a long time. I still listen to Wynton [Marsalis], who I love. \nAre we going to see you rapping again anytime soon? \n[ Laughs ] I have no plans, but never say never.

A scene from MTV Shuga: Down South , the new season of the soap opera that's filming in South Africa this year. Courtesy of Staying Alive Foundation Inc. \nWhen Emmanuel Ikubese first saw the show MTV Shuga , he was a university student and an aspiring actor. Like many fans, he was hooked. \nThere's a lot to like about the show: There's future Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o in her breakout role, playing a go-getter juggling school, work and multiple lovers. There's drama, intrigue and, in the first two seasons set in Nairobi, glimpses of a vibrant nightlife: banging beats, fly fashion and sexy dancing. \nBut for Ikubese, there was something else. \"I was watching it and I was like, 'Man, this show is so deep,'\" he says. The show portrays several characters coping with the AIDS epidemic. \"I don't know why, but I had never been tested at that point,\" Ikubese says. \"It's just something nobody talked about.\" So he got tested (results were negative) and encouraged his friends to, as well. YouTube \nMTV Shuga \u2014 the name is pan-African slang for a woman with a cool vibe \u2014 has launched its fifth season this spring. And Ikubese is one of its stars. He plays mega-hunk club promoter and reformed bad boy Femi. \nWhat he knows now is that Shuga isn't the average teen drama. It's also a public health intervention. Folded into each soapy, 30-minute episode are messages about how and how often to get tested for HIV, as well as scenes that dispel common misconceptions about the disease. \nCommercially, it's doing pretty well. TV channels and radio stations in 42 African countries have signed up to broadcast the latest season of Shuga , and by MTV's count, the show has reached 719 million people worldwide who've either watched or listened to it through local entertainment networks or online on YouTube. In South Africa alone, Shuga seasons 3 and 4 were the number one drama show on the country's biggest TV channel, SABC1. \nAnd there are signs that the health messaging is sinking in as well. A World Bank study published online last month found that six months after watching Shuga , young viewers were twice as likely to get tested for HIV as those who hadn't seen the show. \nThose results validate what Georgia Arnold, the founder of MTV's Staying Alive Foundation, the nonprofit that helped create the program, has been working toward her whole career. \"I think once kids recognize themselves and their own behavior on screen, that's when we get to see them questioning their actions,\" she says. \"So that's why for us, the most important thing always is we start with young people.\" \nFor this latest season, \"before we started writing anything, we did a panel session with a group of kids in a township outside of Johannesburg,\" Arnold explains. \"Then we took their stories and turned them into a storyline,\" she says, with the help of local doctors and counselors to make sure the health messaging was accurate. (U.S. viewers can see the new season on YouTube ) Credit: Courtesy of Staying Alive Foundation Inc. \nShuga also employs its writers, actors and production company from the city where it's set. That was Nairobi for two seasons, then Lagos, Nigeria for another two seasons, and now Johannesburg. Each season incorporates the language, music, culture and color of its local setting. \n\"That's important,\" explains Abhijit Banerjee, an economist at MIT who helped evaluate the public health impact of Shuga for the World Bank. In order to influence young people's behavior, Shuga had to show them characters they could relate to. \nTo test the effectiveness of the show's health messaging, Banerjee and his colleagues recruited 5,000 18- to 25-year-olds across Nigeria. They screened the show to two-thirds of them \u2014 while the rest saw a different Nigerian TV show. Before and after the screenings, researchers questioned all the participants to gauge their knowledge and understanding of safe sex, HIV and domestic violence. Six months later, they asked everyone to come back, to see if any lessons from Shuga had stuck. \nThose in the group that had watched Shuga were twice as likely to be tested for HIV than those who didn't watch. Even though the majority of participants still weren't getting tested, researchers say that's a sign that the message is sinking in. \nThe study also found that the number of chlamydia infections was 58 percent lower among women who watched than among those who didn't watch. And the Shuga viewers were 14 percent less likely to have concurrent sex partners. \nNot everything about Shuga went over as well as the researchers had expected. The show had the unintended effect of making viewers sympathetic toward a character who committed domestic violence. That may have had to do with the way a subplot about a character who beats his girlfriend was presented, Banerjee says. \nIn Shuga , the character who hurts his girlfriend is, by many accounts, a lovely guy. \"But his boss is not nice to him, and he's not as successful as he'd like to be,\" Banerjee says. He's not happy, and his partner isn't as supportive as he'd like her to be. \n\"So for some viewers, a key moment when he ends up hitting her was hard to interpret,\" Banerjee says. Of course, nothing justifies domestic violence, and the show writers will have to think hard about how to make that clear going forward, Banerjee says. \nOverall, the World Bank study \"makes a really compelling case for the show,\" says Suruchi Sood , a public health researcher at Drexel University who wasn't involved with the study. \nSood says she'd love to see more in-depth analysis of Shuga 's public health impact. The results confirm the research on how young people learn: Stories are a safe, accessible way to get information out to adolescents who might otherwise tune out important messages about sexual health. \n\"And the fact that [ Shuga is] doing it at this global scale is quite amazing,\" Sood says. \"I can't think of any other public health intervention that can reach so many people.\" \nOf course, for Emmanuel Ikubese, all this makes perfect sense. After all, the show convinced him to go get tested for HIV and it has also helped him reconsider some of his underlying attitudes toward the disease, he says. \nWhen Ikubese found out that the character he plays would contract HIV in season 3, he was initially hesitant. \"I was really worried about it because, you know, people often confuse actors with the characters they play,\" he says. And there's a lot of stigma associated with being HIV positive in Nigeria. And he worried that the character would be no fun to play.

Adriana Zehbrauskas for BuzzFeed News ID: 10880291 Monica, a mother of three living in Chicago, is intimately familiar with the new dilemma many undocumented immigrants in the US are facing: Keep sending relatives back home money or save it for a lawyer in case they get detained by authorities?\nIt used to be that the receivers of remittances \u2014 poor and dependent, like Marina or her neighbors \u2014 had the most to worry about. Now, in the era of Trump, the senders, too, are terrified.\nThe pressure has become such that Monica, who has been undocumented in the US for 15 years, is ready to go back home to Durango, a state in northern Mexico. BuzzFeed News agreed to withhold her last name due to her fear of deportation.\nMonica wires her mother, who needs medicine and a costly special diet to keep her diabetes in check, about $60 every month. But recently, her mother has begun encouraging Monica and her sister \u2014 the only sources of income she has \u2014 to start sending their money not to her but to a bank account in Mexico for when, not if, they are deported.\nThroughout Trump\u2019s campaign chants of \u201cbuild that wall\u201d filled the former reality TV star\u2019s rallies, which erupted into deafening applause when he promised to make Mexico pay for it. Trump once told the Washington Post how he would do it: Require all immigrants wiring money outside the US to show proof of legal residence.\nHe has not mentioned his campaign-era proposal since taking office, but Rep. Mike Rogers, a Republican from Alabama, revived the matter last month when he introduced a bill which would impose a 2% fee on remittances to Latin America.\n\u201cAnyone who sends their money to countries that benefit from our porous borders and illegal immigration should be responsible for providing some of the funds needed to complete the wall,\u201d Rogers said in a statement .\nRogers did not respond to repeated requests for additional comment from BuzzFeed News.\nMexico received almost $27 billion in remittances in 2016, up 8.8% from the previous year. That money accounts for 2.6% of the country\u2019s total GDP, making it the second-highest source of foreign income after auto exports. That\u2019s made Mexican officials very interested in protecting the flow of cash across the border.\nUndocumented immigrants in the US who spoke with BuzzFeed News say they have limited the time they spend in public places significantly.\nID: 10880355 Armando R\u00edos Piter, a Mexican opposition senator, proposed in September an initiative to ensure that fiscal measures that harm Mexicans abroad are reciprocated to citizens from that country living in Mexico. (Like many Trump-related measures in Congress, it has yet to be discussed seriously among lawmakers.)\nThe concern goes all the way up to the top echelons of the Mexican government. In January, President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto included the protection of a continued and \u201cnot more expensive\u201d flow of remittances in his list of priorities during ongoing negotiations with the US.\n\u201cThe Mexican government takes attitudes and decisions based on what the government of the United States decides,\u201d Virgilio Andrade, director general of the Bank of National Savings and Financial Services, told BuzzFeed News. We will \u201cdefend the fruits of our fellow Mexicans\u2019 work to the maximum,\u201d he declared.\nDespite concerns, analysts agree that a tax on remittances is unlikely to have a significant effect on their flow. Remittances already cost an average of $8.45 dollars to send, so a slight tax won\u2019t cause significant psychological impact. Given the political climate, experts add, a small tax may even be welcome as the lesser of two evils.\n\u201cIf you eliminate the uncertainty during the years Trump will be in power with a 2% tax, migrants will be open to it. Uncertainty is terrible,\u201d said Jes\u00fas Cervantes, manager at the Center for Latin American Monetary Studies.\nWhat the proposed changes to the remittances industry will do, experts say, is nourish and expand the black market that already exists, used to launder the profits of drug sales back to Latin America.\nOr they may simply force undocumented immigrants to turn to relatives or friends with legal residency to send the money for them.\nIn the meantime, Trump\u2019s threats continue to spread fear on both sides of the border. Undocumented immigrants in the US who have spoken with BuzzFeed News say they have limited the time they spend in public places significantly, increasingly afraid that they will be picked up by police and deported. Monica says she and her husband have signed and delivered a power of attorney letter handing over temporary custody of their children to one of their neighbors in case they are detained.\nShe\u2019s also begun the process of obtaining Mexican citizenship for her children. Just in case.\nView this image \u203a\nLeft: La Reyna, one of Susticac\u00e1n\u2019s four grocery stores. Right: Workers building a house. Adriana Zehbrauskas for BuzzFeed News\nID: 10880276 That house was rebuilt using remittances. This one was abandoned by people who moved north. Those other two \u2014 the yellow ones \u2014 abandoned. Built with remittances. On the corner, abandoned.\nGustavo de Santiago S\u00e1nchez, the town\u2019s mayor, sitting in the passenger seat of a car slowly cruising through the town\u2019s main street, pointed out the houses that had been built with remittances and those which were left empty by people who emigrated to the US: Virtually all of them fit either of these two categories.\nS\u00e1nchez waved discreetly at the handful of people walking on the sidewalks as he spoke. The saying here goes, Pueblo chico, infierno grande , or \u201csmall town, big hell,\u201d because everyone knows everyone\u2019s business, for better or for worse.\nPrivate citizens aren\u2019t the only benefactors. The cemetery, an old people\u2019s home, and the main park, a manicured square with canopied entrances and brand new\u2013looking trash cans, were all paid for as part of the \u201c3\u00d71 for Migrants\u201d program.\nUnder the program, launched in Zacatecas in the mid-1980s and now adopted throughout the country, the federal, state, and local governments match every dollar sent by migrants in the US to build schools, churches, and other public works.\nThat is, if money from the US doesn\u2019t stop coming in, either because of strict regulations on remittances or from mass deportations. If it does, crime, nearly negligible now, would go up, unemployment would multiply, and people would go hungry if food supplies remain as they are, said S\u00e1nchez.\nS\u00e1nchez pointed to a two-story coral-colored house \u2014 the Guardado residence, built almost entirely from remittances. What started off as a two-room home with a compact kitchen has become a comfortable residence with an elegant exterior for its seven residents thanks to the $500 or so that their relatives in California send every month.\n\u201cOne lives always anticipating the arrival of help,\u201d said Sira Guardado. Hearing her sibling\u2019s voice over the phone spelling out the money transfer code is the highlight of her month, she added.\nLike many residents here, Guardado was initially skeptical about talking to reporters about her family\u2019s finances, leaning firmly against the elaborate quarry framing the entrance. People say the biggest problem here is envy among neighbors.\nThe six Guardado brothers, who have lived in Los Angeles for decades, now own an Italian restaurant. The money they send home pays for their family\u2019s food and gas, their nephews\u2019s school supplies, and the alfalfa used to feed the 60 cows they own. There are two houses under construction next to the Guardado\u2019s house; they both belong to the California-based brothers.\n\u201cWe would have to declare a state of emergency.\u201d\nID: 10880359 Even with the new uncertainty, life goes on as usual for now. After Marina picks up her money transfer from Jerez, a nearby town where she also buys groceries, she pays her water and gas bills (mostly on time, even if it means asking neighbors for a loan), and keeps a pile of coins around for whenever she goes to the local mill to have her corn ground (50 cents per bucket). There\u2019s one restaurant in town, about one kilometer down the street, but Marina has never been to it.\nShe also saves a dime for every time she visits church. That\u2019s the extent of how much most elderly people can donate; Father Juan Jos\u00e9 Padilla, who\u2019s been working in Susticac\u00e1n for a year and says tithes here don\u2019t suffice, lives off a special subsidy for bishops.\nRemittances have made Susticac\u00e1n \u2014 but they\u2019ve also been its curse. Many people here say that the wealth that has come in has taken with it the motivation to become self-sufficient, an argument that resembles one often made north of the border about the social safety net.\nWhen S\u00e1nchez organized a course to teach local women to sew and men to plant vegetables, he says, few people showed up. Residents don\u2019t mind being dependent on the remittances that so closely resemble foreign aid and don\u2019t care about being productive, he added.\n\u201cI haven\u2019t seen people with the initiative to progress, and create industry and jobs for people,\u201d said Padilla.\nLike many towns that remain afloat from money from the US, Susticac\u00e1n is ill-prepared for a decrease in remittances. The beautiful houses that line the streets could potentially be shown to be just facades should the money from north of the border suddenly dry up. And if Trump goes ahead with his campaign promises, residents agree, the effects would be not only traumatic but potentially unmanageable.\n\u201cWe would have to declare a state of emergency,\u201d said S\u00e1nchez.\nView this image \u203a\nAdriana Zehbrauskas for BuzzFeed News\nID: 10880324"}, {"crawled": "2017-04-18T17:14:33.000+03:00", "title": "Songs We Love: Cende, 'What I Want'", "external_links": [], "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "2a2d4cabb63cdb4fc59f390d7f1dbc89734f835f", "author": "", "thread": {"section_title": "The latest stories from www.wnyc.org", "title": "Songs We Love: Cende, 'What I Want'", "site_full": "www.npr.org", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 875, "likes": 875}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "title_full": "Songs We Love: Cende, 'What I Want'", "site_type": "news", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_4nDdOFsceBgb3phd1EHDYHU.ZlqAnT_BTfj9I1iyuQxf0EN4cifmYPZAgTePHJh4V5lEJDKbyZHzCUd3PP8U2", "uuid": "2a2d4cabb63cdb4fc59f390d7f1dbc89734f835f", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "domain_rank": 495, "spam_score": 0.0, "country": "US", "site": "npr.org", "main_image": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2017/04/13/cende---1-hit-single---press-pic-credit-to-dave-medina-1-_wide-ce4ecba38909b4d1f173e4f473e9cea7f33b4146.jpg?s=1400", "site_section": "http://www.wnyc.org/atomfeeds/all", "published": "2017-04-18T17:14:33.000+03:00", "performance_score": 8, "site_categories": []}, "highlightText": "", "rating": null, "ord_in_thread": 0, "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_4nDdOFsceBgb3phd1EHDYHU.ZlqAnT_BTfj9I1iyuQxf0EN4cifmYPZAgTePHJh4V5lEJDKbyZHzCUd3PP8U2", "published": "2017-04-18T17:14:33.000+03:00", "text": "Enlarge this image Cende's new album, #1 Hit Single, comes out May 26.

(For the curious: The joke in question is a very funny Descendents reference .) The band is a Brooklyn supergroup of sorts, born of the members' cohabitation at a house venue called David Blaine's The Steakhouse and featuring guitarist and singer Cameron Wisch, who drums in Porches, and drummer Greg Rutkin from LVL UP . (The two are also joined by Bernard Casserly on bass and Dave Medina on guitar.)\nCende's music fits between the heavy fuzz of LVL UP and the morose glamor of Porches. The songs on #1 Hit Single , the band's debut album, are jangly, propulsive and infectious. \"What I Want,\" the second single from the album, is a tightly-wound, dynamic road trip. It's emblematic of the band's ability to combine meticulously-arranged song structures (for which the band credits Wisch) with energetic punk influences (for which the band credits Medina).\n\"What I Want\" never stays in one place too long, but Rutkin's rock-solid rhythm maintains a useful throughline. Synthesizers, strings and momentary swells all make appearances as the song traipses through movements and voices; Wisch's matter-of-fact delivery is complemented by the sweet deadpan of Greta Kline \u2014 a.k.a. indie-pop darling Frankie Cosmos. \"I'm invisible / As if you care at all,\" she sings, at once tender and disaffected. The song coalesces to a breakdown where guitars squeal and drums crash, but it's all quickly reined in under Kline's and Wisch's voices as their candy-coated melody reignites. It's both elegant and offbeat; just sweet enough to be thoughtful and just strange enough to be delightful.\n#1 Hit Single comes out May 26 via Double Double Whammy .

The Surround 360, which Facebook unveiled last year as an open-source spec guide for others to build off of , has been upgraded as both a larger, more capable unit and a smaller, more portable version.\nFacebook is calling the big model the x24, because it now has a 24-camera array arranged in an orb instead of the 17 cameras the original flying saucer-shaped Surround 360 called for. The small model is the x6, with just six cameras but in a far more manageable package. Instead of just releasing the design schematics for these cameras online, as it did last year, Facebook is now teaming up with a select group of hardware partners to manufacture and sell finished products later this year. It\u2019s unclear if these products will be Facebook-branded in any way, but the company is still stressing that it has no plans to sell the cameras directly.\nFacebook will let hardware partners make and sell its camera Photo: Facebook As for the upgrades, the x24 and x6 aren\u2019t simply just refined versions of last year\u2019s hardware. They also now capture 8K-quality scenes with what\u2019s known as six degrees of freedom (6DOF), which means your body can move forward, backward, up, down, left, and right so long as your wearing a VR headset with positional tracking like the Oculus Rift. In other words, this is the same kind of freedom of motion high-quality VR allows, but this time with live-action shots. It\u2019s done using a mix of hardware and software that captures a better understanding of the depth of objects in a scene, and replicates perspectives that the camera never captured originally.\n\u201cWe capture and then we can estimate depth,\u201d says Brian Cabral, an engineering director at Facebook who leads Surround 360 development. \u201cWe actually compute for every pixel where it is in the scene.\u201d Once the pixel has a location, he says, viewers can view it from any perspective as it if were part of a real-life scene. After the depth estimation process, which Facebook handles with its own custom software in the cloud, the video then can be edited with any number of standard post-processing toolsets from Adobe, Foundry, and others.\nThe freedom of VR with the fidelity of real life This 6DOF tech has existed in the past, usually reserved for extremely high-end Hollywood special effects and editing tools, yet other companies in the camera and VR space are working on bringing costs down and making content more accessible. Camera maker Lytro is perhaps the best known, with a rig of its own that uses light field technology to capture the geometry of the light in a live-action 360-degree scene. It\u2019s a different approach than Facebook\u2019s, which relies more on computer vision, but it achieves a similar effect.\nFacebook, however, thinks its hardware and software is cohesive and easier to use than existing tech. In a demo shot with its own Surround 360 x24 prototype, I was able to observe the differences between a static, 360-degree video and one with the new freedom of motion. The difference is immediate. In the static video shot at the California Academy of Sciences, I could only look around as if my surroundings were a static painting stretched into a sphere around me.\nIn the updated version, however, I could move my shoulders, lean in close to objects, and even walk around in a small sphere-shaped zone. The effect this has on the viewer is a substantial jump in the level of immersion, making one feel as if they\u2019re viewing a real-life moment play out live instead of simply existing inside of a looped recording. It\u2019s effectively the freedom of VR with the fidelity of real life.\nFacebook\u2019s x24 camera creates a depth mask for every object in a scene. That\u2019s what allows these CGI butterflies to interact with the light and objects in this scene as if they were real. Photo: Facebook Facebook says this will have big implications for the 360-degree format, giving developers the ability to create more engaging videos. You\u2019ll even be able to edit live-action captures with CGI imagery like adding butterflies to an outdoor scene or even changing the background from cloudy to sun or from daytime to nighttime, all thanks to the light and depth data.\nPlus, the content can be captured once and reformatted for different platforms, Cabral says. So you can shoot a video designed for the Rift headset and have it work on the Gear VR or even on a smartphone screen accessing it through the Facebook mobile app. With each step down, you lose features like head and body tracking and the six degrees of freedom. But the fidelity of the compressed image remains high-quality because it was natively captured in 8K.\nFacebook hopes 360-degree video will become as immersive as VR Like the original camera, both of the new Surround 360 models were developed at Facebook\u2019s on-site hardware lab, Area 404, under the supervision of Cabral, who has extensive computer graphics and imaging expertise. Facebook hired Cabral from Nvidia for his engineering and computer vision chops, and he\u2019s been leading the hardware charge at the company\u2019s camera division as a way to solve the difficult \u201cchicken and the egg\u201d problem with 360-degree video. Facebook has the platform to serve this kind of video to billions of users \u2014 and the VR headset company to sell those users pricey hardware. Yet not a lot of this content exists yet. Creators also don\u2019t want to put the time, money, and effort toward creating it if they think users won\u2019t ever experience it.\nThat\u2019s precisely why Facebook has invested resources into building its series of 360-degree video cameras, both to show creators what the tech is capable of and to help kickstart the immersive video boom Facebook thinks might be the future. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do with VR in general is bring people up the immersion curve,\u201d says Mike Schroepfer, Facebook\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201cThe end vision is as close as you can to feeling like your\u2019e actually there. The gold standard is real life.\u201d\nPhoto: Facebook Part of that effort is meeting VR halfway with live-action captures of real-life moments that, over time, incorporate the benefits of virtual worlds. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to be in the camera business. We wanted creative people to be able to make this content,\u201d Schroepfer says. FAcebook hopes to get the cameras to market some time this year, but it wouldn\u2019t disclose pricing. (The original Surround 360 was estimated to cost about $30,000 at using the company\u2019s exact schematics.)\nStill, for the 360-degree video market, Cabral says a camera of this quality \u2014 plus a cheaper, portable version you could use more easily in tighter indoor spaces \u2014 will help push the medium forward. Ultimately, Facebook wants \u201cto establish a creative norm,\u201d Cabral says. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole new language you have to shoot. We can take for granted we can shoot in 2D. The reason we want high-end creators to use this is for them to teach the rest of us.\u201d\nIn this Storystream Facebook F8 conference 2017: the latest news and biggest changes coming to the platform Facebook\u2019s plans to augment reality are as dystopian as they are smart Facebook\u2019s new Surround 360 video cameras let you move around inside live-action scenes Facebook Messenger is getting an Apple Music extension View all 16 stories"}, {"crawled": "2017-04-19T14:45:46.000+03:00", "title": "Fire crews attacked after bins set on fire in Downpatrick | UTV - ITV News", "external_links": [], "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "881bdd4a9ada05b8935113e6bca7105f72779c77", "author": "", "thread": {"section_title": "", "title": "Fire crews attacked after bins set on fire in Downpatrick | UTV - ITV News", "site_full": "www.itv.com", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 867, "likes": 867}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "title_full": "Fire crews attacked after bins set on fire in Downpatrick | UTV - ITV News", "site_type": "news", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9ibLms25NnVImzYjE9lMy4btYDiFu2fDWkHUCl3prMEKvVkTYA6Z8HitBO6_SRx90.cPYJr5i6x55YBS4E2C9KJplLysRJpaW1tAUiOWYcprMKnANXgqhN5oDdPHUv0I0-", "uuid": "881bdd4a9ada05b8935113e6bca7105f72779c77", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "domain_rank": 2701, "spam_score": 0.034, "country": "US", "site": "itv.com", "main_image": "http://www.itv.com/news/assets/branding/fb.png", "site_section": "", "published": "2017-04-19T14:45:46.000+03:00", "performance_score": 8, "site_categories": []}, "highlightText": "", "rating": null, "ord_in_thread": 0, "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9ibLms25NnVImzYjE9lMy4btYDiFu2fDWkHUCl3prMEKvVkTYA6Z8HitBO6_SRx90.cPYJr5i6x55YBS4E2C9KJplLysRJpaW1tAUiOWYcprMKnANXgqhN5oDdPHUv0I0-", "published": "2017-04-19T14:45:46.000+03:00", "text": "Fire crews came under attack during disorder in Downpatrick on Tuesday evening.\nGroups of youths placed bins across the road and set them alight in the Killough Road area.\nWhen firefighters attended they had missiles thrown at them.\nPolice said they remained in the area to monitor the situation overnight but there were no reports of damage being caused.\nDetectives warned that putting emergency vehicles at risk could reduce their ability to deal with calls where they are needed the most.\n\u201cThose involved in throwing missiles at emergency vehicles need to be aware of the dangers their actions can cause,\u201d police said.\n\u201cAny damage caused that results in a vehicle being removed from service for repair will diminish the capability of the emergency services to respond to calls.

People are going to want me to do certain things because they want to prove to the world that I'm still the same person,\" Evelyn shared with E! News exclusively. \"I really don't want to disappoint anybody, but I will say that this season was the most challenging out of all seasons.\" \nIn the season premiere alone, Evelyn faced drama involving her co-stars Tami Roman and Jackie Christie . During a \u201870s-themed party, the ladies confronted Evelyn for some of her actions both online and in interviews from years ago. \n\"[Tami] had cursed me out and I was trying to communicate.. Seasons ago, that could've been very very ugly. I wanted to do the show again. Everything doesn't need to be an argument. We don't have to call each other bitches and hoes every five minutes,\" Evelyn shared. \"We can actually do better and co-exist and respect each other even if we have some differences. That's my overall goal this season and I think you will see that.\" Photos \nStars & Their Sport Studs David Livingston/Getty Images \nIt may be easier said than done. If you thought Monday night's episode was dramatic, hold on for more throughout the season. \n\"There were certain things that were said. We do this show, I get it, you say things about each other when you're angry, or upset, but there's just certain things, this is probably the first season where I feel like\u2026 that one cast member went way below the belt and you will see my reaction to that,\" Evelyn teased. \nOne things viewers won't be seeing is a wedding involving Evelyn and her fianc\u00e9 Carl Crawford . While the couple got engaged in 2013, there are no plans for a televised wedding or public spectacular. \n\"Carl has no social network. He's very private. What I do is a whole other world to him. He's supportive but does he want to be on the show? No. So I think that when we do get married, and you guys hear about it, we probably would be married for a couple of months at that point,\" she explained. \"I don't broadcast that part of my life because I've learned my lesson.\" \nUltimately, Evelyn is grateful her friend and co-star Shaunie O'Neal invited her back to VH1's hit series. And while many members of her family were \"side-eyeing a little bit\" when news broke of her return, the Inner Circle author feels a sense of loyalty to the franchise. \n\"Nobody understands. I am connected to this show. I'm emotionally connected. I was the first person that Shaunie called to do the show,\" she shared with us. \"I do feel a really, really personal connection to the franchise. I want to see it do well.

The trip wasn\u2019t a mere perk: Hobson\u2019s mission was to spend a day shadowing several medical professionals in an oncology clinic, Florida Cancer Specialists & Research Institute , in West Palm Beach. One of those professionals was Dr. Bobby Green, Flatiron\u2019s SVP and a practicing oncologist at the Florida clinic.\nAbout halfway through the day, Hobson recalls, he was shadowing Green. \u201cBobby was trying to tell me a story about the patient we were about to go see,\u201d Hobson recalls. The doctor was sharing a detail that wasn\u2019t critical to the patient\u2019s well-being, but that he nevertheless wanted Hobson to know. But after a few moments of rummaging around files on his laptop, Green couldn\u2019t find the information and decided to move on. \u201cEventually he just said, \u2018Ah, whatever, it\u2019s fine,\u2019\u201d Hobson says.\nBut it wasn\u2019t fine to Hobson. \u201cBasically, I thought to myself, \u2018That\u2019s crazy!\u2019 He should have been able to type whatever he was thinking and get the right thing.\u201d\nA doctor thinks one way; a software engineer, another.\nBobby Green , Keith Cowing , and  Kevin Hobson at Flatiron\u2019s office in New York. [Photo: Clare Mullins] The idea that there are two core ways of thinking, both of which deserve equal status, is the central philosophy at Flatiron Health, which makes software to improve the workflow in cancer clinics and aggregates anonymized data from that software to share with pharmaceutical companies and research institutes. Interaction between engineers and physicians is not a unique notion for medical startups, but few adhere to it as the law of the land like Flatiron does.\nThe company currently employs 25 people with medical degrees of some kind and 104 engineers and technology specialists, whose collaborative approach has played a critical role in the company\u2019s success. Flatiron was recently valued at $1.2 billion, following a $300 million investment from Google Ventures.Dave Chase, a venture capitalist in the health care space (who has no stake in Flatiron), has said that most health care startups are doomed to fail because they commonly consist of \u201ca founding team that is made up of smart technologists who are blind to or dismissive of the idiosyncrasies of health care.\u201d\nIn an interview with Fast Company , Chase calls Flatiron \u201can outlier in a good way,\u201d a company that takes the time to hire not just any old medical experts, but forward-thinking ones who think carefully about data and technology. \u201cThere are a lot of [startups] who\u2019ve checked the box, but really are not checking it with the right kind of doctor,\u201d he says.\n\nWhen Hobson, the software engineer, returned to New York after shadowing Green, he set to work on a Spotlight -like search feature for Flatiron\u2019s core electronic health record product. Hobson realized that by using optical character recognition tech, Flatiron\u2019s software could scan and derive searchable text from things like faxed records and pathology reports.\nFollowing an in-house hackathon, Flatiron\u2019s team began to roll out its \u201cDocSearch\u201d feature to the oncology clinics that use its software in the fall of 2016. Now, with the new feature, all typewritten reports in a patient\u2019s digital file are indexed and easily searchable, making moments like Green\u2019s unsuccessful hunt for patient data a thing of the past.\nFlatiron founders Zach Weinberg and Nat Turner, both in their early thirties, began in the ad tech space, and have no prior experience in the world of medicine. (Their prior company, Invite Media, was acquired by Google in 2010.) \u201cWe felt very early on that providing a clinical context to the engineering and product teams as they were building things was important,\u201d Turner says.\nA screenshot from OncoEMR , Flatiron\u2019s electronic medical record product.  \nThe need for everything to be connected\u2014and for different groups of people to communicate with each other\u2014drives Flatiron\u2019s workplace structure, with medical professionals seated just paces from engineers.\nIt\u2019s an entirely different style of working for the engineering talent, who often hail from top consumer-facing tech companies. For Keith Cowing, Flatiron\u2019s director of product management, the environment requires a bit of humility. Cowing formerly worked at LinkedIn and Twitter, where top coders enjoy godlike status. So when he came to Flatiron, he had to get used to working on teams with people who brought impressive expertise in an entirely different field. \u201cA product manager is used to being the quarterback, the decision maker,\u201d Cowing says. \u201cAnd on clinical teams, a doctor is used to being the quarterback, too. So you\u2019ve gotta bring both of these sides together and check your ego at the door.\u201d\nWorking in tandem fosters creative thinking for developing products and solving mundane hurdles in workflow. Not long ago, Hobson was trapped in a dreary task of sorting out the finer points of diagnosis codes, which are used to process insurance claims. It\u2019s a complicated system where certain diagnoses require different forms altogether, and Hobson wanted to make sure Flatiron\u2019s software could deliver the correct forms to a medical team working with any given patient.\nInstead of slogging through several iterations of prototypes\u2014or worse, shipping a product that users simply wouldn\u2019t find useful\u2014Hobson strolled a few paces from his desk to pick the brain of a pharmacist colleague. After 10 minutes, Hobson had a firmer understanding of which cancer patients were eligible for a certain type of financial assistance, which cleared the path for him to build straightforward software that, he hoped, would mark another step away from the overcomplicated system that defines today\u2019s medical world.\nFixing that broken system one solution at a time is what Flatiron plans to do as it continues to grow. Currently, it has more than 430 employees (up from six in 2012 and 135 in 2014), and works with some 260 cancer clinics. The doctors of more than 1.5 million cancer patients in the U.S.\u2014that\u2019s about one in eight of all people diagnosed with cancer in this country\u2014use Flatiron Health\u2019s products. \u201cCancer isn\u2019t just one thing, and it likely won\u2019t be \u2018solved\u2019 through a single discovery,\u201d Turner says. \u201cWe believe that the biggest progress in cancer treatment will come from ongoing collaboration . . . Accomplishing this is as much of a technology infrastructure effort as it is a health care one\u2014you can\u2019t have one without the other.\u201d"}], "totalResults": 460, "next": "/search?token=86b3b0d7-10fa-4025-b410-6898f9019d7d&format=json&ts=1492494029394&q=language%3A%28english%29+thread.country%3AUS+performance_score%3A%3E4+%28site_type%3Anews%29+site_category%3Aentertainment&sort=social.facebook.likes&from=100&sort=desc", "moreResultsAvailable": 360}
