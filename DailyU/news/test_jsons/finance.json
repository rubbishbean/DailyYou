The giant conglomerate said that there is \"substantial doubt\" about its ability to continue as a going concern and that it's taking steps to deal with the situation. \nToshiba has been hammered by huge losses at its American nuclear business, Westinghouse Electric, which filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. last month. \nAfter twice missing earlier deadlines, Toshiba ( TOSBF ) on Tuesday reported a net loss of 648 billion yen ($5.9 billion) for the quarter ended in December. But in an unprecedented move for a major Japanese company, Toshiba filed the report without the approval of its outside auditors. \nJapanese regulators must now decide whether Toshiba's report is enough even without the auditors' signoff. If not, the struggling conglomerate could face delisting from the Tokyo Stock Exchange. \nHere's where things stand: \nDelayed earnings and delisting threat \nThe refusal by auditor PwC Aarata to sign off on Toshiba's earnings report is another embarrassing blow for the Japanese conglomerate, which is trying to reassure creditors and shareholders that it can survive its current crisis. \nWestinghouse has suffered billions of dollars in losses due to cost overruns and construction delays at nuclear plant projects in Georgia and South Carolina. \nThe U.S. unit's bankruptcy means Toshiba will eventually be able to remove it from its accounts. But the Japanese company has warned that dumping Westinghouse could drag it to a net loss of 1 trillion yen ($9 billion) for the fiscal year that ended in March. \nIt said it could end up reporting a negative net worth of 620 billion yen ($5.6 billion) as of the end of March. \nRelated: Westinghouse Electric is filing for bankruptcy \nPwC refused to sign off on the earnings report Tuesday because it is still studying the results of investigations into Westinghouse's takeover of nuclear construction company CB&I Stone & Webster in 2015, Toshiba said Tuesday. \nRegulators in Japan will have to decide if the delays and disarray mean Toshiba, one of the country's best known multinational corporations, should suffer the humiliation of having its shares taken off the stock exchange. \nSelling off the crown jewels \nTo try repair its balance sheet, Toshiba is now selling a majority stake in its prized computer chip business. CEO Satoshi Tsunakawa has said he expects the unit to fetch at least 2 trillion yen ($18 billion). \nTaiwan-based Foxconn, one of Apple's biggest suppliers, has offered as much as 3 trillion yen ($27 billion), according to The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg. Toshiba declined to comment on the reports, and Foxconn didn't respond to a request   Toshiba chairman steps down as company takes $6.3B hit from nuclear business \nBut the Japanese government is keen to keep Toshiba's hi-tech business in country, according to local media, and has called on domestic companies to form an investment partnership and bid for a stake in the memory chips business. \nToshiba said Tuesday that despite the doubts about whether it can remain a going concern, the sale of the chip business and other assets would enable it to stay financially sound. \nWhat happens to Westinghouse? \nWestinghouse's bankruptcy filing has raised questions about what will happen to the storied U.S. company. \nToshiba says it will have no influence over who buys its majority stake in Westinghouse. That will happen under the supervision of the bankruptcy court \"and we will not be involved in that,\" Tsunakawa told reporters last month. \nThat sale process could fuel concerns in the U.S. government, which reportedly wants to ensure domestic nuclear capabilities don't end up being bought by a Chinese firm. \nWestinghouse is already building reactors in China. Buying the struggling American company could provide China with technology it needs to become a leading player in nuclear power. \nCNNMoney (Hong Kong)  31 AM ET", "rating": null, "entities": {"organizations": [{"name": "toshiba", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "westinghouse", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "foxconn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cb&i stone & webster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "westinghouse electric", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bloomberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tokyo stock exchange", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "tsunakawa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "satoshi tsunakawa", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south carolina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "georgia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "title": "Toshiba warns it may not survive its financial crisis", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "crawled": "2017-04-11T13:36:32.956+03:00", "external_links": [], "thread": {"uuid": "585036ce34e96061b14d3fab88e44f1b9cafe222", "title_full": "Toshiba warns it may not survive its financial crisis - Apr. 11, 2017", "social": {"pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 911, "shares": 911, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 52}, "gplus": {"shares": 13}}, "section_title": "Latest financial news - CNNMoney.com", "site_categories": ["news", "finance", "business"], "title": "Toshiba warns it may not survive its financial crisis", "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170314054907-toshiba-sign-780x439.jpg", "country": "US", "domain_rank": 81, "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "performance_score": 9, "published": "2017-04-11T13:36:32.956+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGoudi8JTHYpjd53h6VSAex5rCJJr04Qy3MhJsFNTKPMhCUSo0etoI5rqjy37K5VmRtFGJGSIbF_jToHvvs58aFDcXf823JKHE6r.Dn9Ax2Qs-", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_latest.rss", "site": "cnn.com", "spam_score": 0.0}, "published": "2017-04-11T13:36:32.956+03:00", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGoudi8JTHYpjd53h6VSAex5rCJJr04Qy3MhJsFNTKPMhCUSo0etoI5rqjy37K5VmRtFGJGSIbF_jToHvvs58aFDcXf823JKHE6r.Dn9Ax2Qs-"}, {"uuid": "edd5ea9eceacd397f71b3efa0955d8cc2051027b", "author": "Catey Hill", "text": "Published: June 12, 2016 8:05 a.m. ET Share \u2018My kid isn\u2019t paying the loan I cosigned?\u2019 \nBy Catey Hill Editor \nIt\u2019s hard to say no to your children, but in the case of cosigning a loan for them, it\u2019s sometimes prudent. \nNearly half (45%) of the people who have cosigned a loan \u2014 a cosigner agrees to pay the loan should the main borrower default on it \u2014 are parents who have done it on behalf of their children or stepchildren, according to a survey of roughly 2,000 adults released Monday by CreditCards.com . (This is by far the most common cosigning scenario, with cosigning for a friend a distant second.) \nParents often do this to help their adult children \u2014 who may have a short or even shoddy credit history \u2014 buy something like a car (this is the most common), qualify for a mortgage, or get a credit card or private student loan, that the child might not have been able to get on his own. \n\u201cParents do it because they want to give their kid a leg up,\u201d says Matt Schulz, senior industry analyst at CreditCards.com, a credit card comparison site. \u201cThey\u2019re hoping everything is going to go great, but it doesn\u2019t always.\u201d Here are three major risks of cosigning a loan for your kids. \nYou\u2019ll foot the bill yourself \nNearly four in 10 people who cosigned a loan ended up having to pay some or all of the bill because the primary borrower didn\u2019t pay it, the survey revealed. That\u2019s because \u201cwhen you cosign a loan, you are 100% responsible for that loan,\u201d says David Hryck, a New York City tax lawyer and partner at Reed Smith . \u201cShould there be a failure to pay the loan, the lender can now come after you for the entire amount.\u201d \nFor parents of adult children, having an additional monthly payment can derail their ability to save enough for retirement. Already, people ages 55 to 64 (many of whom have adult children who might need a cosigner on a loan) have just over $100,000 on average in retirement savings, according to a report from the Government Accountability Office; that\u2019s too little, at least according to Fidelity, which recommends that by age 50, Americans should have six times their salary saved for retirement. \nYou\u2019ll damage your credit \nMore than one in four cosigners (28%) experienced a drop in their credit score because the main borrower paid late or not at all. That\u2019s thanks to the fact that if the person paid their loan late, even if you didn\u2019t know about the late payment as a cosigner, that late payment appears on your credit report. (Furthermore, even if they don\u2019t pay late but do max out the card, that can hurt your credit utilization, which is part of your credit score.) \n\u201cLate or missed payments will be ugly stains on your credit report, says financial writer Valerie Rind, the author of \u201cGold Diggers and Deadbeat Dads: True Stories of Friends, Family, and Financial Ruin.\u201d Furthermore, those stains \u201ccan cost you thousands of dollars because of higher interest rates so you\u2019ll pay more on mortgages, car loans, credit cards, etc.,\u201d says Schulz. \u201cIt\u2019s a big deal.\u201d \nYou\u2019ll harm your relationship with your child \nFully 26% of cosigners say their relationship was damaged because of cosigning. \u201cYou would expect that the parent goes in with the best of intentions so it would be a pretty big breach of trust if the child did not handle business properly on something mom and dad cosigned for,\u201d says Schulz. \u201cIt\u2019s clear that cosigning is causing some awkward conversations around the dinner table.\u201d \nThat said, there are some compelling reasons to cosign a loan for a child. It can help the child get a better interest rate on a loan (assuming your credit is great), saving him potentially thousands of dollars down the road, and to buy something he needs that he couldn\u2019t otherwise get. \nStill, parents have to be careful. First, \u201cif you are going to cosign a loan for someone, you need to be sure that you can afford to take over the loan payments if the other party stops paying,\u201d says attorney Sonya Smith-Valentine, the president of financial wellness firm Financially Fierce . \nNext, you must have an \u201cin-depth conversation with the other party\u201d before you cosign, says Hryck. Talk about your child\u2019s responsibilities when it comes to the loan, what will happen if issues arise, and more. \nYou also want as much information as you can get both before you cosign (ask for their credit report and talk about their past payment history and other loans and financial issues) and after. \u201cMy biggest piece of advice for someone considering cosigning is to live by the motto \u2018trust but verify,\u2019\u201d says Schulz. In other words, make sure you have a lot of access to the account such as the balance information, monthly statements and notifications on things like late payments, so you can deal with potential problems before they become actual problems.

REUTERS/Murad Sezer/File Photo By Andrea Shalal | BERLIN \nBERLIN Recent Russian naval activity in Europe exceeds levels seen during the Cold War, a top U.S. and NATO military officer said, voicing concern that the distributed nature of the deployments could end up \"splitting and distracting\" the transatlantic alliance. \nNavy Admiral Michelle Howard, who heads NATO's Allied Joint Force Command in Naples and commands U.S. naval forces in Europe and Africa, said Russia had clearly stepped up its naval actions in recent years although the size of its navy was smaller now than during the Cold War era. \n\"We're seeing activity that we didn't even see when it was the Soviet Union. It's precedential activity,\" Howard told Reuters in an interview late on Saturday during a missile defense conference. \nHoward cited a wide range of activities, including Russia's deployment of its Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier to the Mediterranean, increased patrols in the north Atlantic and Arctic region, significant out-of-area submarine deployments, and submarine movement in the Black Sea. \n\"They\u2019re a global navy, I understand that. But the activity in this theater has substantially moved up in the last couple of years,\" Howard said. \nShe said there was a danger that members of the NATO alliance would focus on the area of interest closest to them, while losing sight of Russian activities in other areas. \n\"When ... you think about what happens when they move forces around, you look at the alliance and they end up splitting and distracting the view of the alliance,\" she said. \nHoward's comments came amid a sharp escalation in tensions between Russia and the United States after Washington launched 59 cruise missiles against an air base in Syria in retaliation for a deadly toxic gas attack that killed scores of people. \nHoward said the Russian naval maneuvers had been matched by increased persistent cyber attacks by Moscow, and a steady number of unprofessional \"fly bys\" by Russian aircraft of U.S. and other allied vessels at sea. \nTies between Moscow and the West have been strained since Russia's annexation of the Crimea region of Ukraine in 2014 and its support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. \nNATO has built up physical forces in Poland and the Baltic states to build up a deterrent and underscore the strength of the alliance, but U.S. and European officials are also increasingly concerned about what they describe as Moscow's use of propaganda and cyber attacks to influence Western elections. \nRussia denies Washington's claim that Moscow sought to influence the U.S. election, and views NATO's buildup of troops in Europe as a provocation. \nHoward said members of NATO had rallied to increase their capabilities and send a clear signal about the strength and resolve of the alliance. \nShe hailed a recent agreement by Germany and Norway to build new submarines together as a sign of increased cooperation and said she would welcome further efforts by European partners to pool resources. \n(Reporting by Andrea Shalal;

Yes, we have food and snacks but people come to have beer and then they have food with it. Beer first, food later,\" Singh told CNN. \nSingh estimates revenues at The Beer Caf\u00e9 in Gurgaon's Cyber Hub -- a giant complex of offices, bars and restaurants -- have fallen by 99% since the ruling took effect this month. \nIn addition to the lost revenue, billions of dollars worth of investment is at risk across the industry. He estimates the new laws will cost India millions of jobs. \nSingh says the 500-meter rule is arbitrary and destructive for future investment. \n\"The impact isn't just for today. The impact is for the future. Where is my certainty of business?\" asks Singh. \"Why will I start a business because tomorrow this distance could be a kilometer.\" \nDesperate to keep their customers, some businesses are already thinking of ways of getting around the law. At Cyber Hub, the restaurants are talking about building a new road access to the rear of the complex to replace the existing driveway. \nRelated: China joins race for booming Indian car market \nThe new route would be longer than 500 meters, and would therefore allow its restaurants and bars to serve alcohol once again. \nPrince Singhal, the founder of the Coalition Against Drunken Driving (CADD), has sympathy for the struggling businesses but said India needed a jolt. \n\"There are 60,000 fatal accidents on Indian highways every year, and more than 70% of these are linked to alcohol,\" he said. \nThe CADD says that India account for 10% of global road fatalities, with only 1% of the world's vehicles. Drink driving is illegal, but Singhal says there's a lack of awareness of the dangers, as well as lax policing. \n\"The Supreme Court's move is a welcome decision,\" said Singhal. \"It's a beginning.\" CNNMoney (New Delhi)   8:53 AM ET", "rating": null, "entities": {"organizations": [{"name": "the supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "starbucks", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the beer caf\u00e9", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national restaurant association of india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "coalition against drunken driving", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cyber hub", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "ravi agrawal", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "singhal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rahul singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "singh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "prince singhal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gurgaon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new delhi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "title": "India's roadside alcohol ban deals $10 billion blow to bars", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "crawled": "2017-04-10T16:51:04.583+03:00", "external_links": [], "thread": {"uuid": "12f8950c743a5ccc0a9da703850b74412b3e5060", "title_full": "India's roadside alcohol ban deals $10 billion blow to bars", "social": {"pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 937, "shares": 937, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 5}, "gplus": {"shares": 5}}, "section_title": "Business and financial news - CNNMoney.com", "site_categories": ["news", "finance", "business"], "title": "India's roadside alcohol ban deals $10 billion blow to bars", "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/160203100459-india-traffic-2-780x439.jpg", "country": "US", "domain_rank": 81, "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "performance_score": 9, "published": "2017-04-10T16:51:04.583+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGBlXWgAdPa7SrzI_P.q8st.2K6MOzIZj_9_NKff8OyoOZrWUk_uqM.IoMmqkErldcixESDfJASIFjrWdBkMAo6Q--", "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_topstories.rss", "site": "cnn.com", "spam_score": 0.0}, "published": "2017-04-10T16:51:04.583+03:00", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGBlXWgAdPa7SrzI_P.q8st.2K6MOzIZj_9_NKff8OyoOZrWUk_uqM.IoMmqkErldcixESDfJASIFjrWdBkMAo6Q--"}, {"uuid": "9d61765a97b96f8ca11d9cc20041d814ec803400", "author": "BS Reporter", "text": "Moving in tandem with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi's vision to reduce consumption of fuel, petroleum dealers have decided to shut down on every Sunday from May 14 onwards.  \nThis comes at a time when the government is yet to take a call on dealers' commission, something that the petrol pump owners will be protesting by shutting fuel stations on May 10 as no purchase day. \n\"In line with the Prime Minister's appeal to reduce fuel consumption the CIPD has decided to request its members to declare Sunday as holiday from 14 May 2017,\" said A D Sathyanarayan, President, Consortium of India Petroleum Dealers. \nHe told Business Standard that except for emergency services like ambulances, fuel will not be available for other vehicles on Sundays.

The Wells Fargo ( WFC ) task force even cautioned that the bank faced \"reputational risks\" with customers and recommended management consider eliminating the sales goals. \nBut, like other warnings , this 2004 report fell on deaf ears inside Wells Fargo. \n\"There is no evidence that the report and its recommendations were further escalated,\" according to Monday's 110-page investigation released by Wells Fargo's independent board of directors . \nIt's another example of how Wells Fargo executives repeatedly proved unable -- or unwilling -- to take the difficult actions required to fix major flaws the bank's cultural and incentive problems that fueled the scandal. \n\"Senior leaders were reluctant to take steps that they believed might have a negative impact on...financial performance,\" the report said. \nRelated: Wells Fargo claws back $75M from CEO, top exec \nJudges slammed sales goals in 2004 \nRather than admitting the flaws in the sales model, community banking head Carrie Tolstedt and others found it \"convenient instead to blame the problem of low quality and unauthorized accounts and other employee misconduct on individual wrongdoers and poor management in the field,\" the report found. \nEven though it took until September 2016 for the public to learn of the Wells Fargo scandal -- up to 2 million fake accounts and 5,300 fired between 2011 and 2015 -- the behavior was going on for much, much longer. \nThe independent investigation found that \"mass terminations\" for sales abuse went back to \"at least\" 2002 and then \"continued sporadically over the next 10 years.\" \nAnother warning sign that went unheeded from the August 2004 internal investigation report: Wells Fargo had been losing in court when it tried to deny unemployment benefits to employees fired for sales abuses. \nIncredibly, the judges who oversaw those cases were so appalled by what they saw that even they \"made disparaging comments\" about Wells Fargo's incentive system, according to the report. \nYet it took a dozen years -- and a national firestorm coupled with Congressional hearings -- for Wells Fargo to finally eliminate those now-infamous sales goals, where employees were incentivized to open multiple accounts for each customer. \nRelated: Top federal Wells Fargo inspector removed \n'Diminished reputation' \nThe 2004 report even predicted the damage to Wells Fargo's brand that has recently forced the bank to launch several marketing campaigns. \nIf \"customers believe that Wells Fargo team members are not conducting business in an appropriate and ethical manner,\" the report read, \"it will result in loss of business and can lead to diminished reputation in the community.\" \nThe 2004 report was sent to Wells Fargo's chief auditor, a senior in-house employment lawyer, community bank HR personnel, the head and sales and development in the community bank and Michael Bacon, who was head of corporate security at the bank. \nThe findings were also discussed at a \"gaming offsite in October 2004,\" the report said. \nHowever, it wasn't until December 2004 that Tolstedt was provided a memorandum on the task force's work and even then a detailed content of the report was not \"conveyed\" in the memo. \nThe tale of Wells Fargo failing to heed the 2004 warning also shows a critical flaw in the type of \"decentralized structure\" that the bank believed in. \nWells Fargo favored a management style that offered \"strong deference\" to the leaders of various business lines with lax checks and balances, the board investigation found. \nWells Fargo even had a mantra to sum up this style of governance: \"run it like you own it.\" \nRelated: Fed taps new 'too big to fail' regulator \n'Insufficient' action \nThe fake account scandal -- and damage done to employees, customers and shareholders -- could have been minimized if Wells Fargo took action earlier. \nOne way the Wells Fargo board investigation measured the fake account problem is by looking at what percentage of the bank's accounts were funded with at least the minimum amount of deposits. The thinking was that accounts were being opened even when customers didn't want them and in many cases didn't even know about. \nThe rate of Wells Fargo's accounts that met the minimum funding \"dropped steadily\" from about 90% in 2005 to below 80% in 2012, according to the board. \nHowever, it then improved and even exceeded 95% in 2016 \"paralleling Wells Fargo's increasing focus on sales practices\" after 2013. That was the year the Los Angeles Times published a landmark investigation on Wells Fargo's sales culture. \nStill, the board said that once Wells Fargo management did take action, the steps were \"incremental, implemented slowly and insufficient\" to fix the root of the problem. \nWells Fargo's board clawed back an additional $28 million from Stumpf on Monday, saying the former CEO was \"too slow to investigate or critically challenge\" the bank's sales tactics. Tolstedt has to give back an additional $47 million and the board criticized her for having \"resisted and impeded scrutiny\" and \"minimized the scale\" of the problem. \nWells Fargo's current CEO, Tim Sloan, promised in a statement on Monday that the tactics and pressure that hurt employees, customers and the bank's reputation \"will never be allowed to occur again.\" \nWells Fargo has sought to fix its corporate structure by putting more checks and balances under central control and prohibiting Sloan and future leaders from holding the dual roles of chairman and CEO like Stumpf did.

ImageSat International N.V. \u00a9 2017/Handout via REUTERS 3/3 By Tom Perry and Laila Bassam | BEIRUT \nBEIRUT A U.S. cruise missile attack on a Syrian air base may persuade President Bashar al-Assad to be more cautious with some of his tactics, but will not deter him and his allies from pressing a full-throttle military campaign to crush rebels. \nIt was the first time Washington has directly targeted Assad's government in six years of civil war, and has pushed the administration of President Donald Trump into proclaiming that Washington still wants Assad removed from power. \nBut the single volley of Tomahawk missiles was of such limited scope that it will reinforce the view held by Damascus and its allies that the United States is no more eager than before to take the sort of strong action needed to defeat him. \n\"Assad now knows there is a red line with regard to the use of chemical weapons. But I think he also probably just sees it as a slap on the wrist,\" said David Lesch, professor of Middle East history at Trinity University and an author on Syria. \n\"Assad has to recalibrate but not fundamentally change his military approach that they've been engaging in since the Russian intervention,\" Lesch said. \"I really believe they are not feeling too bad today, if this is the extent of what the U.S. is going to do.\" \nDamascus denies carrying out the chemical attack that provoked the U.S. response. The attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the rebel-held province of Idlib near the Turkish border killed at least 87 people, 31 of them children. \nAssad has responded with characteristic defiance, vowing to accelerate efforts to wipe out rebels he calls terrorists. \nA joint command center representing his Russian, Iranian and Lebanese Hezbollah allies said the U.S. attack would only cause them to redouble their support for the Syrian government. \nAir strikes have continued unabated since the U.S. attack on Friday. Eighteen people were reportedly killed in one strike alone in Idlib on Saturday. Though damaged, the Shayrat air base near Homs is partly operational and flights have taken off. \nThe base was largely evacuated before the U.S. strikes, after Washington forewarned Moscow, which in turn alerted the Syrian government, according to a senior military source in the alliance fighting in support of Assad. \nDescribing the U.S. attack as a \"limited strike\" that was quickly over, another senior ally of Assad in the region said toppling him did not seem to be a priority for Trump. \"There is still no clear American policy on Syria,\" he said. \nThough the attack had shown Trump to be unpredictable, a third official in the pro-Assad alliance did not yet see a major shift in the U.S. approach. \n\"Is this a strategic shift by the Americans? Do they want to get into a big problem with the Russians? I don't think there is a strategic shift.\" \nSHIFT FOR TRUMP \nWashington says it acted because Syrian aircraft bombed Khan Sheikhoun with sarin, a banned nerve agent that Damascus pledged to give up in 2013 after Trump's predecessor Barack Obama threatened to bomb as punishment for another alleged gas attack. \nMoscow and Damascus say the deaths were the result of a Syrian air strike on a depot where rebels were making chemical weapons that then leaked into the town - a claim rebels deny and Washington dismisses as beyond credibility. \nThe attack marked a departure from the approach of Obama, who ran a large-scale air campaign in Syria against fighters from Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, but avoided direct entanglement in the parallel civil war to unseat Assad. \nThe Obama administration provided limited support for anti-Assad rebels, but never directly struck government targets after Obama called off such strikes four years ago, at a time when Trump also said attacking Assad would be a mistake. \nAhead of his election victory, Trump had attacked Obama's approach in ways that appeared to suggest he would back off of calls to remove Assad. He questioned the wisdom of backing rebels, suggested that Washington should work more closely with Russia to fight Islamic State, and noted that while he didn't like him, \"Assad is killing ISIS\". \nThe first two months of Trump's presidency passed with little said about Assad's government, while extra U.S. troops arrived to help Kurdish and Arab militias in northern Syria fight against Islamic State. \nA few days ahead of the chemical attack, two top U.S. officials made their clearest pronouncements yet on Syria, saying Washington was not now focused on making Assad leave power and the focus was on defeating Islamic State. \nSome analysts believe the March 30 comments by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley emboldened Assad ahead of the Khan Sheikhoun attack. \n\"I think they were over confident. I think they felt that they could certainly get away with it - if in fact Assad did order this - because Idlib is controlled by al Qaeda affiliates, and the Russians are striking there, and the U.S. has also struck there,\" said Lesch. \n\"NO OPTION BUT VICTORY\" \nSince the attack, Trump has struck a tough tone, saying \"something should happen\" with Assad, but not yet saying what that should be. Haley has made an about face on her previous remarks, saying on Saturday that Assad's removal is a priority. \nTillerson seemed to take a more patient stance in regard to Assad, saying on Saturday that Washington's first priority is the defeat of Islamic State. He has also said there was no role for Assad in Syria's future. \nThe Syrian opposition, which long accused the Obama administration of inaction, wants the U.S. attack to be the start of a more aggressive policy toward Assad. Syrian rebel groups said on Friday the U.S. \"responsibility\" did not end with the missile attack. \n\"We are waiting for the American administration to reveal its complete vision for the Syrian file,\" said prominent opposition politician George Sabra. \nAssad, whose forces have been in a much stronger position since receiving military backing from Russia in 2015, continues to press his advantage in a war that has killed more than 400,000 people and driven half of Syrians from their homes. \nMilitary pressure and siege tactics have forced rebels out of numerous strongholds in recent months, including eastern Aleppo and areas near Damascus. \nThe opposition says Assad is forcibly displacing his opponents to remote parts of Syria in deals that offer rebels safe passage out, calling it a policy of demographic change. \nOne such agreement moved ahead on Saturday as planned. Syrian state TV said the Waer district of Homs city area would be declared \"free of weapons\" this month. The evacuation is taking place in phases, with Russian oversight on the ground. \nSeveral hundred more fighters left Waer on Saturday, which has been besieged for years, for northern Syria with their families. They are being taken by bus to rebel-held areas of northern Syria, accompanied by Russian forces. \nA Russian general interviewed by Syrian state TV said the U.S. attack would not derail implementation of the deal. \nAssad, in an interview before the U.S. attack, made clear that so-called local \"reconciliation\" agreements remain central to his strategy, along with military action.

Titanium also is used extensively on Airbus Group SE's carbon-fiber A350. \n\"This means $2 million to $3 million in savings for each Dreamliner, at least,\" starting in 2018, Chip Yates, Norsk Titanium's vice president of marketing, said in a telephone interview. \nNorsk worked with Boeing for more than a year to design four 787 parts and obtain Federal Aviation Administration certification for them. \nNorsk expects the U.S. regulatory agency will approve the material properties and production process for the parts later this year, which would \"open up the floodgates\" and allow Norsk to print thousands of different parts for each Dreamliner, without each part requiring separate FAA approval, Yates said. \n\"You're talking about tons, literally,\" on the 787 that would be printed instead of made with traditional, expensive forging and machining, he said. \n(Reporting by Alwyn Scott; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)", "rating": null, "entities": {"organizations": [{"name": "boeing dreamliner", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "business news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "boeing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norsk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "airbus group se", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "faa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seattle  seattle boeing co", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norsk titanium as", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norsk titanium", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "federal aviation administration", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "yates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chip yates", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "norsk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan oatis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alwyn scott", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "the u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tokyo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "title": "Boeing Dreamliner cost to drop $2-$3 mln per plane from 3-D printed titanium", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "crawled": "2017-04-10T21:35:33.030+03:00", "external_links": [], "thread": {"uuid": "5c98db7f2392fbadaa3966fd9b027a7950256a2b", "title_full": "Boeing Dreamliner cost to drop $2-$3 mln per plane from 3-D printed titanium", "social": {"pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 942, "shares": 942, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 289}, "gplus": {"shares": 18}}, "section_title": "Reuters: Company News", "site_categories": ["news", "finance"], "title": "Boeing Dreamliner cost to drop $2-$3 mln per plane from 3-D printed titanium", "site_full": "www.reuters.com", "main_image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170410&t=2&i=1180120236&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED391AX", "country": "US", "domain_rank": 408, "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "performance_score": 9, "published": "2017-04-10T21:35:33.030+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqBxlilUsrWydLa.1ZYsKwNPJegIOSk3DqB1nR_13YHRxww--", "site_section": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/companyNews\r", "site": "reuters.com", "spam_score": 0.0}, "published": "2017-04-10T21:35:33.030+03:00", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqBxlilUsrWydLa.1ZYsKwNPJegIOSk3DqB1nR_13YHRxww--"}, {"uuid": "de7a272ad15fb92752cb1e3136f4d5b6a1401587", "author": "", "text": "World News | Sun Apr 9, 2017 | 12:58pm EDT Movement of U.S. Navy strike group a reaction to North Korea: McMaster left right The aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) transits the Pacific Ocean January 30, 2017.

REUTERS/David Becker By Ian Simpson \nA computer hack set off all the emergency sirens in Dallas for about 90 minutes overnight in one of the largest known breaches of a siren warning system, officials in the Texas city said on Saturday. \nDallas' 156 sirens, normally used to warn of tornadoes and other dangerous weather, were triggered at 11:42 p.m. CDT on Friday.

Picture taken April 6, 2017. REUTERS/Erik De Castro By Martin Petty | SCARBOROUGH SHOAL, South China Sea \nSCARBOROUGH SHOAL, South China Sea Far out in the South China Sea, where dark blue meets bright turquoise, a miles-long row of fishing boats anchor near Scarborough Shoal, backed by a small armada of coastguard projecting China's power in Asia's most disputed waters. \nChina still calls the shots at the prime fishing spot and has boosted its fleet there, nine months after an international panel ruled its blockade of the lagoon was illegal. \nBeijing rejected that ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration, which invalidated China's claim of sovereignty over most of the South China Sea. \nBut the presence of Philippine boats dotted between Chinese vessels shows a degree of compliance with the ruling. Overtures from Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who is negotiating billions of dollars worth of loans, investments and trade deals with China, may have helped. \nChina stopped repelling Filipino boats in October and allowed them to fish on the edges of the rocky outcrop, 200 km (124 miles) from the Philippines. Now it appears to be easing restrictions further. \nReuters journalists last week entered the Scarborough Shoal itself - the first access by foreign media since China seized it in 2012 - and witnessed dozens of small boats shuttling day and night into the lagoon to capitalize on its rich fish stocks. \n\"It's good that we're now allowed inside, it helps me to support my family's needs,\" said Vicente Palawan, treading water inside the lagoon, a dive mask on his head and fishing spear in hand. \n\"I don't want the Chinese here, because there's so many, it's affecting the way we fish... but I'm willing to share, I don't want to be thrown out. At least I can fish.\" \nThe coral outcrop is synonymous with the struggle for regional power, and a strategic tinder box. Along with China and the Philippines, Scarborough is claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam. \nDespite its concessions, China's presence here is growing, with a larger contingent of coastguard and fishing boats than was indicated in satellite imagery late last year. \nThat fuels concerns by Manila that Beijing may have ambitions for the Scarborough Shoal similar to the artificial islands it built and fortified in the Spratly archipelago, inside the Philippines' exclusive economic zone. \nPEACEFUL COEXISTENCE \nFor now, there is a cordial coexistence between the Filipinos and Chinese who anchor side by side less than 100 meters (yards) from the 46-km (28-mile) triangle of rock that barely pokes above the water. \nChinese in straw hats zig-zag from boat to boat, using hand signals to barter with Filipinos for cigarettes, liquor and fish. \nSmall boats hum as they move in and out of the lagoon, through a buffering line of coral that has for centuries provided fishermen with bountiful catches and haven from storms. \nIn crowded, rickety boats, Filipinos are outnumbered about ten-to-one and complain of competition from the beefed-up Chinese contingent. \n\"We used to fish for a few days, now it's a few weeks, but at least we have something,\" said Ramil Rosal, a boat captain and fisherman for 20 years. \n\"China is fishing more, and Filipinos have to share with them. But they don't bother us. Some are helpful.\" \nA half-dozen vessels from the China Marine Surveillance enforce their rules in an area the arbitration court in The Hague declared a traditional fishing site for all countries. It did not rule on sovereignty of the shoal. \nPhilippine Foreign Minister Enrique Manalo said the improved access was \"certainly in line with the arbitral ruling\". \nSTRICT SURVEILLANCE \nFishermen told Reuters China's coastguard prohibited larger vessels from entering the lagoon, but allowed small two-man boats to fish there freely. \n\"It applies to Chinese and Filipinos,\" Rosal said. \nCoastguard in high-powered dinghys were sometimes dispatched from large vessels to get a closer look as unfamiliar boats arrived in the area. \nThree coastguard ships were of the kind Manila last year said were capable of dredging. One was permanently inside the shoal, but it was unclear what it was doing. \nThe coastguard collaborates with Chinese fishermen, shown when a Reuters team pulled up alongside a Chinese boat. \nA crewman dashed to fetch a hand-held radio and photographed the journalists. Moments later, a coastguard vessel changed course and moved at speed towards the area, but turned back after a brief chase. \nChina's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters questions about Scarborough Shoal. Its most recent comments are vague, stating only that the situation at the shoal was unchanged. \nFilipino fishermen said Vietnamese were also fishing at Scarborough, a sign that Hanoi could be testing the new arrangement. \nReuters saw no Vietnamese boats, however, and two Vietnamese fishing organizations said they were unaware any had gone to the shoal. Vietnam's government did not respond. \nWhile the situation at Scarborough is improved, tensions remain high. \nReports last month that China planned to build an environmental monitoring station at Scarborough sparked consternation in the Philippines. Duterte said he could not stop China, but had been assured of no construction \"out of respect for our friendship\". \nJust last week, Duterte ordered the upgrade of facilities on the nine reefs and islands the Philippines occupies in the South China Sea, alarming both China and Vietnam. \nFor now, Filipinos are making the best of the detente. Some stay at the shoal for months. \nWith blackened skin and torn clothes, men jostle for space on the overloaded bamboo outriggers of boats, transferring baskets of fish to a vessel making a run back to the Philippines. \nCaptain Renato Etac, 37, chain smokes as he weighs the fish and meticulously logs details of each delivery. Though fish stocks are declining, Scarborough is a \"fiesta\" for Filipinos, he says. \nHe even takes a positive view of China's coastguard. \n\"If they're not here, Scarborough becomes open to all, including illegal fishing,\" he said. \"It somehow acts as deterrent.\" \n(Additional reporting by Peter Blaza at Scarborough Shoal, Mai Nguyen in Hanoi, and Michael Martina in Beijing; Editing by Lincoln Feast)", "rating": null, "entities": {"organizations": [{"name": "lincoln feast", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china marine surveillance", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scarborough", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scarborough shoal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "permanent court of arbitration", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "peter blaza", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "renato etac", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "enrique manalo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vicente palawan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rodrigo duterte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mai nguyen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael martina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters/erik de castro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scarborough shoal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scarborough", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "martin petty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "duterte", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ramil rosal", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "south china sea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "the hague", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philippines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hanoi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "taiwan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "south china sea  scarborough shoal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manila", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scarborough shoal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "asia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vietnam", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "title": "Exclusive: At strategic shoal, China asserts power through control, and concessions", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "crawled": "2017-04-10T02:50:33.877+03:00", "external_links": [], "thread": {"uuid": "d4b350ab819a2f75fe18de14b65da88b9d37df90", "title_full": "Exclusive: At strategic shoal, China asserts power through control, and concessions", "social": {"pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 802, "shares": 802, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 11}, "gplus": {"shares": 3}}, "section_title": "US Newspapers: National", "site_categories": ["news", "finance"], "title": "Exclusive: At strategic shoal, China asserts power through control, and concessions", "site_full": "www.reuters.com", "main_image": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170409&t=2&i=1180010171&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED380TM", "country": "US", "domain_rank": 408, "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "performance_score": 8, "published": "2017-04-10T02:50:33.877+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqBzkpLVSja6jPXc2m5emNZZzJRb4jqpT8nuZGalmgGLtN7KReTZgBa2oGd_veXY1KWqKfh1B5_ppoQ--", "site_section": "http://www.newslookup.com/rss/newslookup-usnp.rss", "site": "reuters.com", "spam_score": 0.0}, "published": "2017-04-10T02:50:33.877+03:00", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqBzkpLVSja6jPXc2m5emNZZzJRb4jqpT8nuZGalmgGLtN7KReTZgBa2oGd_veXY1KWqKfh1B5_ppoQ--"}, {"uuid": "bed437a1844d367bc1eeaffdc1bef69bd4ad6348", "author": "cnbc.com", "text": "Rapid run-ups in debt are the single biggest predictor of market trouble. So it is worth noting that over the past 10 years the amount of student loan debt in the U.S. has grown by 170 percent, to a whopping $1.4 trillion \u2014 more than car loans, or credit card debt.\nIndeed, as an expert at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recently pointed out to me, since 2008 we have basically swapped a housing debt bubble for a student loan bubble. No wonder New York Federal Reserve president Bill Dudley fretted last week that high levels of student debt and default are a \"headwind to economic activity.\"\nRead more from The Financial Times: \nDonald Trump still open to bank break-up proposals \nNew York Fed chief warns on US student debt\nThe tangled web of Gary Cohn, Goldman Sachs and Glass-Steagall \nIn America, 44 million people have student debt. Eight million of those borrowers are in default. That's a default rate which is still higher than pre-crisis levels \u2014 unlike the default rate for mortgages, credit cards or even car loans.\nRising college education costs will not help shrink those numbers. While the headline consumer price index is 2.7 percent, between 2016 and 2017 published tuition and fee prices rose by 9 percent at four-year state institutions, and 13 percent at posher private colleges.\n\"The student loan market is hopelessly opaque \u2014 only a quarter of students can predict their own debt load.\" A large chunk of the hike was due to schools hiring more administrators (who \"brand build\" and recruit wealthy donors) and building expensive facilities designed to lure wealthier, full-fee-paying students. This not only leads to excess borrowing on the part of universities \u2014 a number of them are caught up in dicey bond deals like the sort that sunk the city of Detroit \u2014 but higher tuition for students. The average debt load individual graduates carry is up 70 percent over the past decade, to about $34,000.\nHaving just attended the first college preparation meeting at my daughter's high school, where I was told to expect a $72,000 a year sticker fee for Ivy League and liberal arts colleges, I would feel lucky to get away with just that.\nThis is clearly, as Mr. Dudley observed, a headwind to stronger consumer spending. Growing student debt has been linked to everything from decreased rates of first time home ownership, to higher rental prices, to lower purchases of white goods and all the things that people buy to fill homes. Indeed, given their debt loads, I wonder how much of the \"rent not buy\" spending habits of millennials are a matter of choice.\nBut there are even more worrisome links between high student debt loads and health issues like depression, and marital failures. The whole thing is compounded by the fact that a large chunk of those holding massive debt do not end up with degrees, having had to drop out from the stress of trying to study, work, and pay back massive loans at the same time. That means they will never even get the income boost that a college degree still provides \u2014 creating a snowball cycle of downward mobility in the country's most vulnerable populations.\nshow chapters Student debt forgiveness, reportedly not so forgiving after all      Friday, 31 Mar 2017 | 10:28 AM ET | 00:48 How did we get here? Extreme politics played a role. In the U.S., the Koch Brothers/Grover Norquist tax revolt camp of the Republican party has been waging a state by state war on public university funding for years now: states today provide about $2,000 less in higher education funding per student than before 2008, the lowest rate in 30 years.\nMeanwhile, the subprime crisis cut the ability of parents to use home equity loans to pay for their children's education (previously a common practice). This left the bulk of the burden to students, at a time when the unemployment rates for young people of all skill levels were rising.\nThe trend is not limited to the U.S., of course. In the U.K. and beyond, completely free post-secondary education is a thing of the past. Beleaguered governments are pushing more and more of the responsibility for the things that make a person middle class \u2014 education, healthcare and pension \u2014 on to individuals.\nWhat are the fixes? For starters, we should look closely at the for-profit sector, where default rates are more than double those at average private colleges. These institutions receive federal subsidies but typically spend a minuscule part of their budgets on instruction; in the U.S., nearly 50 percent goes on marketing to new students. It looks all too much like an educational Ponzi scheme.\nTransparency is also key \u2014 the student loan market as a whole is hopelessly opaque. In one recent U.S. study, only a quarter of first year college students could predict their own debt load to within 10 percent of the correct amount. Truth in lending documents would help, as would loan counselling paid for by colleges. Sadly, the agency that is leading the fight on both \u2014 the CFPB \u2014 is under attack from Trump himself.\nBut the administration will not be able to hide from the student debt bubble. In an eerie echo of the housing crisis, debt is already flowing out of the private sector, and into the public. Before 2007, most student loans were underwritten by banks or other private sector financial institutions. Today, 90 percent of new loans originate with the Department of Education. Socialization of risk continues to be the way America deals with its debt bubbles.\nWould that we considered making college free, as Bernie Sanders suggested.

REUTERS/Ammar Abdullah \nLONDON Britain said on Sunday Russia bore responsibility by proxy for civilian deaths in Syria last week caused by a poison gas attack that Washington says was carried out by the Moscow-backed government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. \nAt least 70 people died in what the United States says was a chemical weapons attack in rebel-held Syria. The attack prompted the United States to fire 59 cruise missiles into a Syrian air base from which it said the attack was launched. \nDamascus and Moscow denied Syrian forces were behind the gas attack but Western countries dismissed their explanation that chemicals leaked from a rebel weapons depot after an air strike. \nRussia has warned that the U.S. missile strikes could have serious consequences for the region. The missile strikes catapulted Washington into confrontation with Russia, which has advisers on the ground aiding its close ally Assad. \nBritish Defense Secretary Michael Fallon criticized Russia's support of Assad, describing the chemical attack as a war crime that happened \"on their watch\". \n\"By proxy Russia is responsible for every civilian death last week,\" Fallon wrote in the Sunday Times newspaper. \n\"If Russia wants to be absolved of responsibility for future attacks, (President) Vladimir Putin needs to enforce commitments, dismantle Assad\u2019s chemical weapons arsenal for good and get fully engaged\" with the U.N. peace process on Syria. \nWashington has long backed rebels fighting Assad in a multi-sided civil war that has killed more than 400,000 people and driven half of Syrians from their homes since 2011. \nThe United States has conducted air strikes against Islamic State, which controls territory in eastern and northern Syria, and a small number of U.S. troops are helping rebel militias. \n(Reporting by William James;

Thousands gathered outside the church in Tanta shortly after the blast, some wearing black, crying, and describing a scene of carnage. \n\"There was blood all over the floor and body parts scattered,\" said a Christian woman who was inside the church. \n\"There was a huge explosion in the hall. Fire and smoke filled the room and the injuries were extremely severe,\" another Christian woman, Vivian Fareeg, said \nPresident Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Prime Minister Sherif Ismail are set to visit the Tanta site on Sunday and Sisi has ordered an emergency national defense council meeting, state news reported. 'We feel targeted' \nA shift in Islamic State's tactics, which has waged a low-level conflict for years in the Sinai peninsula against soldiers and police, to targeting Christian civilians and broadening its reach into Egypt's mainland is a potential turning point in a country trying to prevent a provincial insurgency from spiraling into wider sectarian bloodshed. show chapters Monday, 3 Apr 2017 | 4:07 PM ET | 03:01 \nEgypt's Christian community has felt increasingly insecure since Islamic State spread through Iraq and Syria in 2014, ruthlessly targeting religious minorities. In 2015, 21 Egyptian Christians working in Libya were killed by Islamic State. \n\"Of course we feel targeted, there was a bomb here about a week ago but it was dismantled. There's no security,\" said another Christian woman in Tanta referring to an attack earlier this month near a police training center that killed one policeman and injured 15. \nCopts face regular attacks by Muslim neighbors, who burn their homes and churches in poor rural areas, usually in anger over an inter-faith romance or the construction of a church.

REUTERS/Suhaib Salem 16/16 By Isabel Coles | QAYYARA, Iraq \nQAYYARA, Iraq The babies cry with hunger but are so severely malnourished that doctors treating them at a hospital in Iraq would make their condition worse if they fed them enough to stop the pangs. \nMany of the starving infants are from Mosul, where war between Islamic State militants and Iraqi forces is taking a heavy toll on several hundred thousand civilians trapped inside the city. \nA new, specialist ward was opened recently to deal with the growing number of children from Mosul showing signs of malnutrition as the conflict grinds on -\u2013 most of them less than six-months-old. \nThat means they were born around the time Iraqi forces severed Islamic State's last major supply route from Mosul to Syria, besieging the militants inside the city, but also creating acute shortages of food. \n\"Normally nutritional crises are much more common in Africa and not in this kind of country,\" said pediatrician Rosanna Meneghetti at the hospital, which is run by aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in Qayyara, about 60 km (40 miles) south of Mosul. \"We did not anticipate this\". \nSo far, the number of cases recorded is below the level considered critical but it nonetheless highlights the hardship faced by civilians who are effectively being held hostage by Islamic State. \nIraqi forces backed by a U.S.-led coalition have retaken most of the city but are struggling to dislodge the militants from several districts in the west, including the Old City. \nResidents who have managed to escape say there is almost nothing to eat but flour mixed with water and boiled wheat grain. \nWhat little food remains is too expensive for most residents to afford, or kept for Islamic State members and their supporters. \nFORMULA MILK SHORTAGE \nIn the ward, a team of doctors monitors the babies' progress in grams, feeding them a special peanut-based paste that will gradually accustom them to eating and increase their weight. \nOn one bed lies a six-month-old boy weighing 2.4 kg \u2013 less than half the median weight for an infant of that age. \nThe diminutive patients are also treated for other diseases associated with malnutrition, which weakens the immune system, making them even more vulnerable. \n\"It's a new thing in Iraq,\" said MSF project coordinator Isabelle Legall. \"Most of the (Iraqi) doctors have never seen it (malnutrition)\". \nPart of the problem, Legall said, is a lack of tradition of breast-feeding among Iraqi mothers, who usually raise their babies on formula milk, which is now almost impossible to come by in Mosul. \nEven if they want to breastfeed, many mothers find it difficult due to the physical and emotional strain of living in a warzone: \"The mother is very stressed and can't find much food herself so cannot produce so much milk,\" Meneghetti said. \nOne of the mothers from Mosul told the doctors she had no option but to feed her baby sugar dissolved in water, yogurt, or a mixture of flour and water. \n\"All of this is because of Daesh (Islamic State),\" said another mother, keeping vigil over her emaciated baby. \nSome of the babies come from villages that were retaken from Islamic State months ago, pointing to a wider trend of food insecurity. \nTWO PATIENTS TO A BED \nOn average, more than half the patients seen in the emergency room of the MSF hospital are under the age of 15, partly because there is a shortage of pediatricians in the area, so many children are referred there. \nSigns on the doors of the portacabins that house different wards prohibit visitors from entering with weapons. \nThe pediatric ward is so full there are two patients to each bed, and most of the women's wing is taken up by children recovering from war injuries such as broken limbs, burns and shrapnel. \nMany babies are brought to the hospital with respiratory problems such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia -\u2013 most of them from camps for the displaced, where cramped conditions enable viruses to spread. \nTwo children buried under blankets are suffering from birth asphyxia which occurs when a baby's brain and other organs do not get enough oxygen before, during or immediately after being born. \nMeneghetti said their mothers had probably needed a surgical birth but were unable to reach a hospital so delivered at home and experienced complications. \nLying listless on another bed is a boy who was wounded by shrapnel when his father picked up a box of explosives, intending to move the danger away. It blew up in his hands, wounding them both along with several other family members. \nThe expression on eight-year-old Dua Nawaf's face is haunting. \nThe girl suffered burns to the head and hands in an airstrike by the U.S.-led coalition that killed more than 100 people in the Mosul Jadida district last month, including both her parents. \n\"The family told me this morning that she (Dua) had some problems, especially in the night, so we are organising a mental health (assessment) for her,\" Meneghetti said, reaching into her pocket for a balloon, which she inflated and gave to the girl. \nOnly the faintest hint of a smile appeared on Dua's face. \n(Editing by Angus MacSwan) ", "rating": null, "entities": {"organizations": [{"name": "reuters world news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "medecins sans frontieres", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "legall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isabel coles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "angus macswan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "meneghetti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "isabelle legall", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dua nawaf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ayham ahmed", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dua", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosanna meneghetti", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nawras raed", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "mosul", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "old city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mosul jadida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq  qayyara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "qayyara", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "africa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "salem", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iraq", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "title": "Babies starve as war grinds on in Mosul | Reuters", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "crawled": "2017-04-11T15:15:35.178+03:00", "external_links": [], "thread": {"uuid": "55da71ff764c92256a4750236ddeb953164dbb07", "title_full": "Babies starve as war grinds on in Mosul | Reuters", "social": {"pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 753, "shares": 753, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}}, "section_title": "", "site_categories": ["news", "finance"], "title": "Babies starve as war grinds on in Mosul | Reuters", "site_full": "www.reuters.com", "main_image": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170411&t=2&i=1180216414&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED3A0TJ", "country": "US", "domain_rank": 408, "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "performance_score": 7, "published": "2017-04-11T15:15:35.178+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqBy_pkOl3McuhCMYUrZEpXfC.53oivgVkuXrJvzV8Sg_pPt2l1AxAOYtaJ8EZ5084huvJ_eIRC1l9A--", "site_section": "", "site": "reuters.com", "spam_score": 0.715}, "published": "2017-04-11T15:15:35.178+03:00", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqBy_pkOl3McuhCMYUrZEpXfC.53oivgVkuXrJvzV8Sg_pPt2l1AxAOYtaJ8EZ5084huvJ_eIRC1l9A--"}, {"uuid": "8bb636efeebc9359e7ff17a5712317a1acf470e8", "author": "", "text": "World News | Mon Apr 10, 2017 | 1:05am EDT U.S. air strike gives Tillerson a boost for Moscow talks U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson makes a statement about the visit of China's President Xi Jinping and about the situation in Syria, at Palm Beach International Airport in West Palm Beach, Florida, U.S., April 6, 2017. REUTERS/Joe Skipper By Lesley Wroughton and Yeganeh Torbati | WASHINGTON \nWASHINGTON U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's visit to Moscow this week will be an early test of whether the Trump administration can use any momentum generated by striking a Syrian air base to craft and execute a strategy to end the Syrian war. \nEven before Trump ordered last week's strike on the air base in retaliation for a nerve gas attack, Tillerson's visit was certain to be dominated by thorny issues, including Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, an apparent violation of an important arms control treaty, and seeing what cooperation, if any, is possible in the fight against Islamic State. \nNow, Tillerson, a former oil executive with no diplomatic experience, is charged with avoiding a major U.S. confrontation with Russia while exacting some concessions from Russian President Vladimir Putin. Those include getting rid of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's remaining chemical weapons stocks and pressing Assad to negotiate Syria's future. \nRussia, along with Iran, is Assad's primary backer, and its intervention in Syria's war has been crucial to ensuring his grip on power, although no longer over the entire country. \nTillerson said he had not seen hard evidence that Russia knew ahead of time about the chemical weapons attack but he planned to urge Moscow to rethink its support for Assad in the April 12 talks. \n\"I'm hopeful that we can have constructive talks with the Russian government, with Foreign Minister (Sergei) Lavrov and have Russia be supportive of a process that will lead to a stable Syria,\" Tillerson told ABC's \"The Week\" on Sunday. \nThe U.S. cruise missile strike on Thursday, meant to dissuade Assad from using chemical weapons again, gives Tillerson more credibility with Russian officials and will boost his efforts, observers and former officials said. Tillerson is due to meet with Russian officials on Wednesday, and is expected to meet with Putin and Lavrov. \n\"The demonstration of the administration's willingness to use force has the potential to add some leverage to the diplomacy,\" said Antony Blinken, a deputy to former Secretary of State John Kerry. \nThe U.S. strike - ordered less than three days after the gas attack - could make it clear to Russia that the United States will hold Moscow accountable for Assad, Blinken said. \nTillerson ought to be \"very matter of fact\" in his meetings, Blinken said, sending Russia a message that: \"If you don't rein him in, we will take further action.\" \nTillerson said on Thursday that Russia had \"failed in its responsibility\" to remove Syria's chemical weapons under a 2013 agreement, which he argued showed Russia was either complicit with the gas attacks or \"simply incompetent.\" Securing a Russian commitment on eliminating Assad's chemical weapons is likely to be first on his agenda, said Evelyn Farkas, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense in the Obama administration. \nRUSSIAN LEVERAGE WITH ASSAD \nThe Russian talks will be a major test of Tillerson's diplomatic skills. As a former chief executive at Exxon Mobil, he has experience doing business in Russia, but no background in the often public negotiations that international diplomacy requires. \nIt also is unclear if Trump, who has expressed skepticism of multilateral institutions such as the European Union and United Nations, will have patience for the protracted negotiations that a comprehensive deal on Syria would require. \nRussia condemned the U.S. missile strike as illegal and Putin said it would harm U.S.-Russia ties. Moscow also said it would keep military channels of communication open with Washington, but would not exchange any information through them. \nIt was an unforeseen turn of events for Trump, who praised Putin repeatedly during last year's election campaign and said he would like to work more closely with Russia to defeat Islamic State. Just a little more than a week ago, top administration officials were signaling that removing Assad is no longer a U.S. priority. \nBut one senior official said it was significant that Russia suspended, and did not cancel, cooperation with the United States after the American air strike. Nor did Lavrov cancel Tillerson's visit to Moscow, suggesting that Russia may be willing to tolerate the single strike. As of this weekend, the talks were still on. \n\"They're going to try to draw a line around this incident,\" said Alexander Vershbow, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia during the George W. Bush administration. \"They are still not giving up on working with the Trump administration.\" \nThe Trump administration also wants to keep the focus in Syria on defeating Islamic State rather than opening a conflict with Russia or Syria's government. \nAnother U.S. official said one hope is that Moscow will see Tillerson's visit and a discussion about how to cooperate to stop Assad's use of banned weapons as a tacit acknowledgement of Russia's great power status, one of Putin's main ambitions. \n\"The strikes aren't necessarily a bad thing for Russia,\" said Andrew Tabler, a fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. \"Russia's had a very hard time getting President Assad to come to the negotiating table in any kind of meaningful way.\" \nNow, Tabler said, the Russians can point to more U.S. strikes as the price of further intransigence by Assad. \n(Editing by John Walcott and Bill Trott)", "rating": null, "entities": {"organizations": [{"name": "abc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "exxon mobil", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington institute for near east policy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united nations", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "tillerson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "alexander vershbow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "andrew tabler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "assad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george w. bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john walcott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "evelyn farkas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "john kerry", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bill trott", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "blinken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lavrov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rex tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bashar al-assad", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lesley wroughton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yeganeh torbati", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tabler", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xi jinping", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "antony blinken", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vladimir putin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sergei) lavrov", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "iran", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "florida", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west palm beach", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "palm beach international airport", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington  washington u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "title": "U.S. air strike gives Tillerson a boost for Moscow talks", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "crawled": "2017-04-10T08:21:27.320+03:00", "external_links": [], "thread": {"uuid": "8bb636efeebc9359e7ff17a5712317a1acf470e8", "title_full": "U.S. air strike gives Tillerson a boost for Moscow talks", "social": {"pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 760, "shares": 760, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 19}, "gplus": {"shares": 7}}, "section_title": "Reuters: Politics", "site_categories": ["news", "finance"], "title": "U.S. air strike gives Tillerson a boost for Moscow talks", "site_full": "www.reuters.com", "main_image": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170410&t=2&i=1180035987&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED39077", "country": "US", "domain_rank": 408, "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "performance_score": 7, "published": "2017-04-10T08:21:27.320+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqBy6db0blOe4WQ.kIL35qfZrDSsV81hDSBe2qN.cym89CIjCPOFKnVUZ", "site_section": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/politicsNews", "site": "reuters.com", "spam_score": 0.0}, "published": "2017-04-10T08:21:27.320+03:00", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqBy6db0blOe4WQ.kIL35qfZrDSsV81hDSBe2qN.cym89CIjCPOFKnVUZ"}, {"uuid": "d462afa8180b92c63266c9714c357009299c8d1b", "author": "", "text": "World News | Sun Apr 9, 2017 | 5:49am EDT Iran's Rouhani condemns 'flagrant U.S. aggression' in Assad call, state TV says Iranian President Hassan Rouhani inspects the honour guard during a welcoming ceremony upon his arrival at Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow, Russia March 27, 2017.

Robert Bentley was expected to resign Monday rather than risk impeachment over allegations he abused his powers to cover up an extramarital affair with a top aide, a former administration member said.\nThe mild-mannered 74-year-old Republican and one-time Baptist deacon was at peace with the decision and planned to announce it during a Cabinet meeting Monday afternoon, according to the person, who was not authorized to release the information and spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity.\nThe sex-tinged scandal gathered force over the past few days and legislators turned up the pressure by opening impeachment hearings Monday. Bentley had steadfastly refused to resign, even though it appeared he had practically no support in the GOP-controlled Legislature.\nBentley's resignation would follow the ouster of former House Speaker Mike Hubbard, who left office in 2016 after being convicted on ethics charges, and former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy Moore, who was suspended from his post last year over an order opposing same-sex marriage.\nBentley, a staunch family-values conservative who won two terms partly because of his reputation for moral rectitude, was first engulfed in scandal last year after recordings surfaced of him making sexually charged comments to 45-year-old political adviser Rebekah Caldwell Mason.\nAn investigative report prepared for the House Judiciary Committee and released last week said Bentley encouraged an \"atmosphere of intimidation\" to keep the story under wraps and directed law enforcement officers to track down and seize the recordings. The report portrayed the governor as paranoid and obsessed with trying to keep the relationship secret.\nThe committee on Monday started what was expected to be days of hearings.\nBentley lawyer Ross Garber had argued that impeachment should be reserved for only the \"most grave misconduct,\" noting that only two U.S. governors have been impeached since 1929, and both were indicted for serious felonies.\n\"It is not unusual for elected officials to have ethics and campaign finance issues. In fact, many governors face these things. It is very rare, though, for legislators to try to leverage those issues to impeach a governor. In fact, it is simply not done,\" Garber told The Associated Press in an email.\nGarber also represented former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who in 2009 became the last U.S. governor to be impeached. He was removed from office, and is now serving a prison sentence, for conspiring to sell an appointment to President Barack Obama's vacant U.S. Senate seat.\nThe investigative report contained text messages that the governor sent to Mason. They were intercepted by Bentley's then-wife, Dianne Bentley, who was able to read the messages because they also showed up on the governor's state-issued iPad, which he had given her.\n\"I sure miss you.

It says the Syrian government launched the attack from the Shayrat air base. Damascus has strongly denied carrying out the attack and says it does not use chemical weapons. \nThe Syrian army said on Friday the attack had caused extensive damage to the base, which the United States says it targeted with 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles. \n\"The airport is operating as a first phase,\" Homs governor Talal Barazi told Reuters. \"Planes have taken off from it,\" he added, without saying when. \nAsked if it was true that Syrian planes were now taking off from Shayrat or that the air base is operating, a Pentagon spokesman referred questions to the Syrian government. \nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based organisation that reports on the war, said warplanes had taken off from the base on Friday and carried out air strikes on rebel-held areas in the eastern Homs countryside. \nAn activist with an opposition air raid warning service said however that the first flight from the base was on Saturday morning. \nU.S. President Donald Trump suggested on Twitter that the runway itself had not been the target of the missile strikes. show chapters Friday, 7 Apr 2017 | 2:35 PM ET | 03:09 \n\"The reason you don't generally hit runways is that they are easy and inexpensive to quickly fix (fill in and top)!\", he said. \nA senior military source in the alliance fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad said the airbase had been mostly evacuated thanks to a warning from Russia, which has deployed its military to Syria in support of Assad. \nThe senior military source, a non-Syrian, said only a few out-of-service jets were destroyed. \nThe United States warned Russia ahead of the attack. \nAssad is also backed in the war by Iran and the Lebanese group Hezbollah, and other Iranian-backed groups. \nThe Pentagon said the missiles targeted aircraft, hardened aircraft shelters, petroleum and logistical storage areas, ammunition supply bunkers, air defense systems, and radars.

Fewer than half of URI students and 15% of RIC students finish in four years. Just 5% of CCRI students earn their degree in two years, according to the governor's office. \nAnnual tuition and fees currently cost in-state students about $12,884 at URI, $8,206 at RIC, and $4,266 at CCRI. \nRoom and board would not be covered under the scholarship. \nRelated: Everything you need to know about New York's free tuition scholarship \nThe governor's office expects the program to benefit at least 7,000 students and cost $30 million each year once fully implemented -- or less than 0.5% of the state's budget. As with New York's scholarship, Raimondo has proposed the scholarship as a \"last dollar\" program. That means it will cover the gap a student has on their tuition bill after using up any federal or state grants he or she already receives. \nRaimondo needs the state Senate and House of Representatives to approve the plan. Both are controlled by fellow Democrats, but not everyone is on board with the scholarship plan. House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello has called it \"truly unsustainable\" and \"fiscally irresponsible.\" \nRelated: San Francisco will tax the rich to pay for free community college \nThe governor has proposed including the Rhode Island Promise Scholarship in next year's budget, which needs to be finalized before the start of the fiscal year on July 1. \nFree-tuition plans have picked up steam since they were proposed by both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton in last year's presidential campaign. Tennessee and Oregon already offer free tuition at community colleges for all residents, regardless of income, and San Francisco will start this year. \nLouisiana has covered tuition for students who meet certain academic standards for decades. But the cash-strapped state could not afford to fund the scholarships fully this year, leaving some students scrambling. \nAre you a college-bound Rhode Island resident?

REUTERS/Joe Skipper By Sarah N. Lynch | WASHINGTON \nWASHINGTON U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Sunday blamed Russia's inaction for helping fuel a deadly poison gas attack against Syrian civilians last week, saying Moscow failed to carry out a 2013 agreement to secure and destroy chemical weapons in Syria. \n\"I think the real failure here has been Russia's failure to live up to its commitments under the chemical weapons agreements that were entered into in 2013,\" Tillerson said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \n\"The failure related to the recent strike and the recent terrible chemical weapons attack in large measure is a failure on Russia's part to achieve its commitment to the international community,\" he added. \nTillerson is expected in Moscow this week for talks with Russian officials. \nHe stopped short of accusing Russia of being directly involved in the planning or execution of the attack, saying he had not seen \"any hard evidence\" to suggest the nation was an accomplice to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. \nBut he said the United States expected Russia to take a tougher stance against Syria by rethinking its alliance with al-Assad because \"every time one of these horrific attacks occurs, it draws Russia closer into some level of responsibility.\" \nOther than that, he added, \"there is no change to our military posture\" toward Syria. \nTillerson's comments came just a few days after the United States fired dozens of cruise missiles at the Syrian airbase that was allegedly used in the chemical attack. \nU.S. President Donald Trump ordered the strikes after he blamed Assad for this week's chemical attack, which killed at least 70 people, many of them children, in the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun. The Syrian government has denied it was behind the attack. \nVideo depicted limp bodies and children choking while rescuers tried to wash off the poison gas. Russian state television blamed rebels and did not show footage of victims. \nThe move immediately prompted a backlash from Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said it would damage U.S.-Russian relations. \n(Reporting by Sarah N.

There's a tussle at the top of the global booze business. \nThe company that makes China's eye-wateringly strong Moutai drink is edging out Diageo ( DEO ) , the owner of Johnnie Walker, as the world's most valuable liquor firm. \nKweichow Moutai, whose fiery signature product has an alcohol content of 53%, hit a market capitalization of $71.5 billion on Friday, pushing it past Diageo. \nBased in the southwestern province of Guizhou, Moutai makes a high-end type of baijiu, a popular Chinese liquor distilled from sorghum and rice. The company's stock has been on a tear this past year, soaring more than 50%. \nRelated: How to drink baijiu: Beijing's pros share their tips \nMoutai has a storied place in Chinese culture and is considered the \"drink of diplomacy.\" It was used to toast President Richard Nixon on his landmark trip to China in 1972. \nTo this day, Moutai is considered the gift to give and the drink of choice to toast with on special occasions, especially big business deals. That's made it a staple at lavish banquets, the very ones discouraged by Chinese President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption campaign. \nAs the campaign got under way in 2012, Moutai sales took an initial hit, but that didn't last long. \n\"They got smart,\" said Shaun Rein, the founder of China Market Research in Shanghai. Moutai cut prices to make its baijiu more affordable and broadened distribution to make it more accessible, according to Rein. \nThe drinks maker turned its attention to a wider, younger consumer base rather than the government officials to whom it had traditionally appealed. \nFor the moment, that approach seems to be working. But Moutai has a huge dependency on the Chinese market, which accounts for 95% of its sales. \nRelated: Russians ditch legal booze as moonshine sales spike \nIt has made some efforts to expand outside of the country, but without much success. \nRein says there's still potential at home, with more young people now able to afford the punchy price tag -- a 500 ml bottle (about one pint) can set you back as much as $580 -- and a slow but steady increase in luxury purchases. \nPerhaps most important, Moutai's brand is so strong in China, Rein says, that \"they just don't have any real competitors.\" CNNMoney (Hong Kong) First published April 10, 2017: 5:17 AM ET ", "rating": null, "entities": {"organizations": [], "persons": [], "locations": []}, "title": "The world's most valuable drinks firm is now Chinese - Apr. 10, 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "crawled": "2017-04-10T12:26:22.763+03:00", "external_links": [], "thread": {"uuid": "6f408cd0b11924bf46c14f9e72cdeec9392ac76e", "title_full": "The world's most valuable drinks firm is now Chinese - Apr. 10, 2017", "social": {"pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 689, "shares": 689, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 42}, "gplus": {"shares": 5}}, "section_title": "", "site_categories": ["news", "finance", "business"], "title": "The world's most valuable drinks firm is now Chinese - Apr. 10, 2017", "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170410165219-moutai-china-780x439.jpg", "country": "US", "domain_rank": 81, "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "performance_score": 6, "published": "2017-04-10T12:26:22.763+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGBlXWgAdPa7Q7fRFP0wtbnAJJxhfZx1XIhWpFd2Y8Ruihn8KNUDAk7mnyVAOg40JpSeMYvisvDxAKg5erVGEdIA--", "site_section": "", "site": "cnn.com", "spam_score": 0.295}, "published": "2017-04-10T12:26:22.763+03:00", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGBlXWgAdPa7Q7fRFP0wtbnAJJxhfZx1XIhWpFd2Y8Ruihn8KNUDAk7mnyVAOg40JpSeMYvisvDxAKg5erVGEdIA--"}, {"uuid": "8c32cbe32a89148209d3e4034568b822ffee91f3", "author": "Henning Gloystein", "text": "SINGAPORE Oil prices were firm on Monday, supported by strong demand and political uncertainty in Syria, although another rise in U.S. drilling activity kept a lid on gains.\nBrent crude futures LCOc1, the international benchmark for oil, were at $55.39 per barrel at 0109 GMT, up 15 cents, or 0.3 percent, from their last close.\nU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were up 24 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $52.48 a barrel.\nTraders said prices were being supported by strong demand, and also political uncertainty following the U.S. missile air strikes on Syria late last week.\nANZ bank said on Monday that strong oil demand and \"an unsettled global backdrop (is) leaving the market very finely balanced.\"\nHowever, another increase in U.S. oil drilling, which has run up for 12 straight weeks to 672 rigs - the highest level since August 2015, kept markets from breaking last week's one-month highs of over $56 per barrel.\nU.S. bank Goldman Sachs said following the rig data release that year-on-year U.S. oil production \"would rise by 215,000 barrels per day in 2017\" once a backlog of production waiting to be brought back online was taken into account.\n(Reporting by Henning Gloystein;

REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins 3/3 By Eyanir Chinea and Alexandra Ulmer | CARACAS \nCARACAS Venezuelan opposition supporters took to the streets again on Monday to protest a grinding economic crisis and an erosion of democracy under leftist President Nicolas Maduro, in the first sustained wave of anti-government demonstrations in three years. \nVenezuelans have been irate for months over shortages of basic goods and roaring inflation that have led to millions skipping meals or surviving on starches. \nBut demonstrations had ebbed amid protester fatigue, until a Supreme Court decision in late March to assume the functions of the opposition-led congress sparked outcry. \nThe court quickly overturned the most controversial part of its decision but the move triggered condemnation at home and abroad, as did Friday's news that the national comptroller had banned politician Henrique Capriles - seen as the opposition's best hope in a presidential election scheduled for next year - from office for 15 years. \nFour nationwide protests in the last 10 days degenerated into clashes between youths throwing stones and security forces spraying crowds with tear gas. On Monday, there were protests in several cities. A few thousand people marched in Caracas but authorities blocked the highway and fired tear gas. \n\"It's working, the government is scared and making mistakes like banning Capriles, because that generates more support for him,\" said homemaker Imelda Guerrero, 66, who said her three children have emigrated due to the crisis. \n\"But this is will be a long struggle, it's only just starting,\" she added in Caracas. \nThe opposition is demanding a date for gubernatorial elections, meant to be held last year, and is seeking early presidential elections. \nDespite the surge in protests, many Venezuelans are pessimistic that marches can bring about change, scared of violent clashes, or simply too busy trying to find food. \nARRESTS, FOREIGN PRESSURE \nMaduro's unpopular government accuses the opposition of fomenting violence to lay the ground for a foreign invasion. \nSome 188 protesters, most of them students, were arrested in the period April 4-8 and 57 are still behind bars, rights group Penal Forum said on Monday. \nNine people, including two teenagers, were arrested for breaking into an office of the Supreme Court and vandalizing it at the end of Saturday's march. And a 19-year-old was shot dead in violence around protests on Thursday. \nThe government has come under increased pressure from American and European countries that have condemned violence in Venezuela and the ban on Capriles. \nMaduro, a former bus driver and union leader who accuses foreign countries of \"meddling,\" traveled to communist ally Cuba on Sunday for a meeting of the leftist ALBA bloc. \n\"The lazy one has gone to Cuba on holiday, he would do the country a favor by staying there,\" Capriles jabbed at him on Twitter. \n(Writing by Alexandra Ulmer;

Eater executive editor Helen Rosner tweeted that \"Reporters like [Watkins] are propagandists complicit in state violence. A low-rent Leni Reifenstahl who history will utterly forget.\" \nJoel Christopher, the executive editor of the Courier-Journal, called the idea that Watkins was helping United a \"ridiculous criticism.\" \nIn a phone interview on Tuesday, Christopher stood by the story, saying it was a valid subject as Dao's story is known to the paper's local audience. But Christopher also acknowledged that the initial version of the story did not clearly establish Dao's connection to the local audience. \n\"We didn't do a good enough job of explaining that context,\" Christopher said. \nThe story has since been updated to accommodate the likelihood that, as Christopher put it, \"much of the audience that is reading it isn't from Louisville or Kentucky.\" \n\"There's a difference between looking at it through a national lens and a local lens,\" he said. \"The fact is that Dr. Dao is known to our local audience. His previous case was covered by media here. It's a pretty well-known case. So it would be unusual in any market for any news organization to not acknowledge when someone who's been thrust into the spotlight has previously been in the news.\" \nBut there are media critics who would argue that Watkins' story fell short of that goal. \n\"The @courierjournal covered only the rap sheet, not full measure of the person. Don't make this mistake,\" tweeted NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik. \"I can see a case for story about a local figure [who] was caught up in the news. This wasn't it.\" \nThere were also other reporters and outlets that couldn't make the claim of pursuing a local angle as they covered Dao's history, among them the New York Post and Lisa Fletcher, a reporter for WJLA in Washington, D.C. \nFletcher was pilloried on Tuesday after tweeting a photo of documents that she said detailed Dao's \"troubled past.\" \nFletcher later deleted the tweet, and clarified that her story is not \"one-sided.\" She also denounced \"violent threats\" that she said been directed at her. \nBut the case of Dao is only one of several recent examples of news outlets taking hugely popular stories into uncomfortable territory. \nKen Bone, the red sweater-donning Illinois voter who became an internet celebrity after he appeared at a presidential debate last fall, quickly found his digital footprint under examination by reporters. \nAnd after a Chicago man named Gary Coe made an impromptu appearance during this year's Academy Awards broadcast, several outlets revealed that he had just finished serving time in prison. \nStories like that are often born out of newsroom pressure to wring as many clicks out of the viral sponge as possible. \nBut Christopher insists that the article on Dao was legitimate, and only one partof \"a whole body of reporting\" that his paper has done on the subject. \nAnd ultimately, Christopher said the anger shouldn't be directed at his reporter. \n\"Morgan was assigned this story, and the decision on what to publish and what not to publish is out of her hands,\" he said. \"Any criticism should be directed my way.\" CNNMoney (New York) First published April 11, 2017: 4:29 PM ET ", "rating": null, "entities": {"organizations": [{"name": "united", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "wjla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york post", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "npr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morgan watkins", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united airlines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "courier-journal", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "tom kludt", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "gary coe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morgan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leni reifenstahl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christopher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david dao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glenn greenwald", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helen rosner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lisa fletcher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ken bone", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fletcher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "joel christopher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david folkenflik", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "watkins", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "illinois", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "louisville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kentucky", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "title": "Backlash after newspaper reports on United passenger's background -

This was not the start of a trade war some had feared. \nThere was no repeat of claims that China was stealing U.S. jobs by manipulating its currency. There was also no grand bargain between the leaders of the world's two biggest economies. \nInstead, they agreed to a \"100-day plan\" for talks, according to U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross. \nRelated: Trump, Xi have 'candid,' 'positive' talks in Florida \nWhat they hope to achieve is unclear. Ross admitted that it was \"a very, very short time\" for trade talks. \nAnalysts say China could make small concessions, but they won't have much impact on America's $310 billion trade deficit. \n\"The 100-day timeframe will probably ... lead China to give the U.S. administration some quick, easy wins such as deals or announcements on airplane and agricultural commodity purchases,\" said Louis Kuijs, head Asia economist at Oxford Economics. \nQuick wins \nThose wins may include offering U.S. banks and insurers more freedom to invest in China, and lifting a ban on imports of U.S. beef, the Financial Times reported, citing U.S. and Chinese officials. \nChina's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it couldn't confirm the report. \nRelated: Chinese firm creates jobs in Rust Belt county that voted for Trump \nMoves like that would give Trump small victories he can tout on Twitter. But they won't make much progress towards the main goal, which Ross described as increasing exports to China and reducing the trade deficit. \nExperts say the Trump administration should focus on getting China to do more to open up its markets to American firms rather than fixating on the trade deficit . \n\"The problem is that significant measures to specifically bring down the U.S.-China trade deficit ... would be economically damaging to all parties involved,\" Kujis said. \"I hope the approach will eventually shift.\" China's TPP alternative \nThe risk is that heavy handed moves could disrupt the patterns of trade in which countries -- including the U.S. -- benefit from specializing in particular fields, Kujis said, noting that even China runs deficits with some countries. \nRisk of trade war recedes \nThe main success of the Florida meeting appears to have been the lack of public disputes, despite Trump warning ahead of time that trade issues would make the encounter \"very difficult.\" \n\"We have very similar economic interests, and I think there are areas that they clearly want to work with us,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said after the summit. \nSuch language is a long way from Trump's campaign threats to slap tariffs of as much as 45% on Chinese goods and label the country a currency manipulator. He hasn't followed through on either -- and the 100-day plan suggests he won't do so anytime soon. \nThe Treasury Department's latest report on currencies \"is going to come out in the near future,\" Mnuchin said. \nAnalysts say they think the chances of the report labeling China a currency manipulator are low. \n\"The threat of a trade war has diminished considerably, at least for the next few months,\" economists at Daiwa Capital Markets said in a research note. \n-- Steven Jiang contributed to this report.

The prizes recognize work from the 2016 calendar year, which means some of the entries involved election themes. Winners and finalists were announced on Monday. \nOther winners included the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, McClatchy and the Miami Herald, in the explanatory reporting category, for coverage of the Panama Papers; the East Bay Times for breaking news; the Washington Post's David Fahrenthold for national reporting; and the Charleston Gazette-Mail for investigative reporting. \nThe Washington Post's David Fahrenthold won the national reporting prize. \n\"David never took things at face value. He checked out everything with amazing persistence. And he went about his work in an innovative, highly resourceful manner -- soliciting the assistance of the public via Twitter. In that way, he reimagined how investigative reporting can be carried out while also providing a level of transparency into his work that fascinated the public,\" Post editor Marty Baron said in a statement. \nAfter the election, Fahrenthold became a CNN contributor on top of his Post reporting. \nShort summaries accompanied each winning entry. Only one of the prize summaries -- for Fahrenthold's reporting -- mentioned President Trump by name. \nBut some of the other prizes recognized work that reckoned with the consequences of the campaign and tried to lend insight to the election and its aftermath. \nWall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan received the commentary prize for, the judges said, \"rising to the moment with beautifully rendered columns that connected readers to the shared virtues of Americans during one of the nation's most divisive political campaigns.\" CNNMoney (New York) First published April 10, 2017: 3:14 PM ET ", "rating": null, "entities": {"organizations": [], "persons": [], "locations": []}, "title": "ProPublica, New York Daily News, Post's Fahrenthold win Pulitzers - Apr. 10, 2017", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "crawled": "2017-04-10T22:25:48.425+03:00", "external_links": [], "thread": {"uuid": "b624ffc0dba1c594a62c30feda931829aa860770", "title_full": "ProPublica, New York Daily News, Post's Fahrenthold win Pulitzers - Apr. 10, 2017", "social": {"pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 639, "shares": 639, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 9}}, "section_title": "", "site_categories": ["news", "finance", "business"], "title": "ProPublica, New York Daily News, Post's Fahrenthold win Pulitzers - Apr. 10, 2017", "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170410123521-pulitzer-prize-780x439.jpg", "country": "US", "domain_rank": 81, "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "performance_score": 6, "published": "2017-04-10T22:25:48.425+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGBlXWgAdPa7R0mtxnytKIN7JjPJz6O4kCrl0qZTT_5Oll8dJrJt7dk3EmCwEf8E9tdFqEiu1cWhY-", "site_section": "", "site": "cnn.com", "spam_score": 0.225}, "published": "2017-04-10T22:25:48.425+03:00", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGBlXWgAdPa7R0mtxnytKIN7JjPJz6O4kCrl0qZTT_5Oll8dJrJt7dk3EmCwEf8E9tdFqEiu1cWhY-"}, {"uuid": "67450505c2fa73dedef3108643e2ce341204d7af", "author": "", "text": "Tesla just became the most valuable carmaker in America by Danielle Wiener-Bronner @CNNMoneyInvest April 10, 2017: 11:26 AM ET Inside Tesla's enormous battery factory Tesla has inched ahead of General Motors to become the most valuable car company in America. \nThe electric-car maker hit a market value of $50.84 billion on Monday, edging past GM ( GM ) at $50.79 billion. \nIt's another milestone for Tesla ( TSLA ) , which passed Ford ( F ) , valued at about $45 billion, last week.

He'll wear plaid on plaid with a plaid bow tie,\" said his younger brother Joel. \nThose fashion eccentricities aren't limited to the well-known actor. \n\"All of the Murray brothers are quirky with clothes,\" said Joel. \nAnd they are equally serious about golf. So it made perfect sense for six brothers to create a golf clothing line for men called William Murray Golf. \nIt launched this month with Bill as the face of the brand, which means it's loaded with playful irreverence. Bill Murray wearing the Cinderella Story polo shirt. \nThink bright colors, playful prints and clever references to Murray's movies. \nThe logo itself is a faceless Bill throwing away his golf club. There are bright tartan shorts, tartan button-down shirts and, Joel's favorite, a polo shirt with tiny whiskey glasses printed all over it. \n\"Every couple of glasses, there's a glass tipped over with whiskey pouring out of it,\" he said. \nRelated: Shanked! Titleist IPO lands in the rough \nAnother shirt, the Cinderella Story polo, features brightly-colored mums with a few random ones falling apart. It's an homage to the movie \"Caddyshack,\" a classic Bill Murray film, which features a scene where Bill lops a row of mums with his club. Ed Murray, Andy Murray, Brian Murray, John Murray and Joel Murray wearing the William Murray Golf Collection. \n\"Things have gotten pretty stale in golf clothing,\" Joel said. \"We need to inject a little fun into it. This could help get more millennials into the sport.\" \nHis own son, who's 25, prefers to play an abbreviated 6-hole round on the course. \nThe Murrays partnered with theChive, a photo-driven website with a huge male fanbase, to develop William Murray Golf. The collaboration started two years ago after the Murray Brothers discovered theChive had created a fun Bill Murray T-shirt that was a top seller. \nRelated: How a leather bag startup hit $1 million in sales in 14 months \n\"At first we were flattered. But Bill wasn't getting anything from it,\" said Joel. The resulting partnership has theChive's team handling design, production, distribution and sales, all of which require input and clearance from the Murray brothers. The clothes (priced between $32 to $90) are sold online at WilliamMurrayGolf.com and theChive.com. \n\"We're very hands on,\" said Joel, who's in charge of the brand's day-to-day business decisions. \"All of us look at the designs. Bill speaks up if he thinks something isn't crazy enough.\" The tipped-over whiskey glass golf shirt. \nJoel pegs the Murray humor, love of golf and distinct fashion style to the family's upbringing in the North Shore of Chicago. \n\"We were nine siblings. We didn't have a lot of extra clothes. It's probably why we make interesting fashion choices now,\" said Joel \nBill, for instance, rarely wears polo shirts on the golf course. \n\"He hated getting hand-me-down polos from his older brothers. So he mostly wears button-down shirts on the course,\" said Joel. \nRelated: This robot makes a T-shirt from start to finish \nGolf was like a religion in the family. \n\"We were all altar boys. One by one, we were recruited coming out of church to train as caddies,\" said Joel. \"It was hard work, subservient work, two things that we realized much later on that we weren't interested in.\" \nYet, all six brothers were inducted into the Caddy Hall of Fame in 2015. \"It was a great honor for all of us,\" said Joel, adding that the brothers still get together every year for their Murray Bros.

But, hey, you\u2019re going running later, so you should be fine \u2014 right? \nThere is no shortage of online charts and even government-endorsed digital dieting tools that will instruct you in this way of thinking. Some dietitians and nutritionists even do it. The concept fits in neatly with contemporary nutrition culture, with its simple mathematical mantra of \u201ccalories in, calories out.\u201d \nNot so fast, say a growing number of experts and studies . That way of thinking has prevailed for years, but is a significantly oversimplified way of looking at diet, they say. \n\u201cThere is probably a large part of the healthy population that this works for, but it doesn\u2019t work for enough people that we can say, \u2018This is how it works,\u2019 \u201d said dietitian Ashley Koff. \nThese types of tools aren\u2019t wrong, exactly, she said. \u201cThey could be right for a certain group of people. But what it\u2019s doing is oversimplifying how one gets and keeps a healthy weight loss.\u201d \nThe calculator below illustrates how such estimates come about, using a set formula to calculate how much activity may be required to burn the calories in a food item. But it and other tools like it assume that there are no problems with calories in, calories out. The calculator was devised by Graphiq and uses data from the ESHA nutrition database. \nMost nutritionists also simplify things. What are dieters supposed to do if their only caloric model doesn\u2019t always work? \nKoff is right there with you. \u201cMy biggest frustration is that nobody\u2019s saying the same thing,\u201d she said. \nHow exercise works \nPart of this comes down to how bodies and metabolisms vary. Factors such as gender, current weight and body composition all influence how many calories a person burns with any one activity. \nMen, who tend to have more muscle, burn more calories than women. People who are very overweight or obese may burn calories at a higher rate. Even among exercisers in the same age range, differences in calorie burning abound, said Kristin Kirkpatrick, a dietitian at the respected Cleveland Clinic. \nThat means a chart saying that 36 minutes of yoga will negate a bag of Lay\u2019s chips doesn\u2019t reflect how any one individual body works. Same goes for a Zumba poster claiming a single class will burn 1,000 calories. \n\u201cIf you take seven different people of different ages, genders and body size, put them all in a line and tell them to run three miles, they\u2019re all going to burn different amounts of calories,\u201d Kirkpatrick explained. \nRead more: Here\u2019s the real secret to losing weight and staying thin (hint: you\u2019re not going to like it) \nThose calorie numbers aren\u2019t always wrong, but they do fall within a range, so there\u2019s no guarantee every person looking at that number is actually meeting it with his or her exercise regimen. \nThen there\u2019s the exercise itself, which differs in intensity and quality. Intense interval training is different from time spent texting on the elliptical, for example. \nPlus history factors into how individual bodies interact with exercise. If you\u2019ve been doing the same gym routine for a long time, it\u2019ll put less stress on your body and thus won\u2019t result in the same heightened metabolic level. \n\u201cYour weight loss is multifactorial; it\u2019s not just your calories. There is a particular thing that works for your body, and that\u2019s going to be a factor,\u201d Koff said. \nRelated: 10 things the weight-loss industry won\u2019t tell you \nSo, contrary to all those charts, you can\u2019t quite exercise additional calories away. \nIn fact, people often overestimate how much they\u2019ve burned off during exercise, Kirkpatrick and others said, and then overeat as a result \u2014 and causing weight gain. \nWhat calories consist of \nSo are these kinds of calories-to-exercise calculations useless? They can be helpful to understand what food contains and how it\u2019s supposed to be used, or as an energy source, experts said. \nBut even if a person could be sure they were burning off their indulgences, it shouldn\u2019t be used \u2014 as Kirkpatrick puts it \u2014 as \u201calmost like a way to game the system.\u201d \nRead: Would you eat better if calorie labels made you feel guilty? \nBesides being a unit of energy, a calorie also affects how hungry a person will be later, as well as their ability to lose or maintain their weight. Calorie quality also helps refuel the body after that exercise, and influences a person\u2019s energy level moving forward, said Maria Elena Rodriguez, a dietitian at the Mount Sinai Health System. \nExercise won\u2019t reverse the other aspects of that pint of ice cream: the way it affects the liver, for example, or the large amount of sugar going into the body. \n\u201cWe need to teach people to eat better, not to game the system to eat foods ... [thinking] they can just walk the calories off later,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. \nSee: McDonald\u2019s has ditched wraps \u2014 as should we all \nStill, this is hardly the clarion call for calorie extinction. \u201cWe still need to look at calories in some ways,\u201d Kirkpatrick said. \nThere is \u201csome truth\u201d to calories in, calories out, with calories still making a difference on a basic level, she said, though the model doesn\u2019t account for significant differences in how people burn calories and in the calories themselves. \nBut it is time to retire your spin-to-supper calculations. \n\u201cIf you have a cookie, then run 3 miles, is that really enjoying your cookie?

The report did not name the official, which is common in KCNA reports. \nThe airstrikes, announced shortly after Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping wrapped up dinner at a two-day summit in Florida last week, were retaliation against Syrian President Bashar Assad for a chemical weapons attack against civilians caught up in his country's long civil war. \n\"Some forces are loud-mouthed that the recent U.S. military attack on Syria is an action of warning us but we are not frightened by it,\" the report said, adding that the North's \"tremendous military muscle with a nuclear force as its pivot\" will foil any aggression by the U.S. \n\"We will bolster up in every way our capability for self-defense to cope with the U.S. evermore reckless moves for a war and defend ourselves with our own force,\" it said. \nNorth Korea has long claimed that the United States is preparing to conduct similar precision strikes against its territory or even launch an all-out invasion. It claims its nuclear weapons are a necessary deterrent to the U.S. military threat. \nWashington denies it has any intention of invading the North. \nTensions have been even higher than usual over the past few weeks because annual war games between the U.S. and South Korean militaries are underway. The exercises this year are the biggest ever and have included stealth fighter training and other maneuvers that are particularly sensitive to North Korea. show chapters Friday, 7 Apr 2017 | 6:13 AM ET | 01:44 \nFor its part, the North test-launched a ballistic missile just ahead of the Trump-Xi meeting and has been rumored to be preparing for a possible nuclear test. \nThe Korean Peninsula remains technically at war since the 1950-53 Korean conflict ended with an armistice, not a formal peace treaty. \nNorth Korea considers Syria an ally. But unlike Syria, experts warn that North Korea has a means of striking back if provoked. \nAlong with its rapidly advancing nuclear and long-range missile capabilities, the North has its artillery and short-range missiles trained on Seoul, the capital of U.S. ally South Korea and a city of more than 10 million people.

(Pic: Lihlumelo Toyana, Netwerk24) Related Articles Eskom boss blames board for B2B fiasco \nCape Town - Phone records show that acting Eskom CEO Matshela Koko lied about speaking with his step-daughter's business partner, according to the Sunday Times .The paper reported that Koko was in contact with Pragasen Pather around the time that Eskom awarded multimillion-rand contracts Impulse International. The two men denied that they knew each other, but later changed their tunes. The calls are believed to be part of an investigation into the possible conflict on interest over lucrative contracts from Eskom when Koko's stepdaughter was a director at Impulse International. A report was published in the Sunday Times on March 26 alleging that Impulse International scored R1.8bn in contracts, from a division of Eskom that Koko headed until he was appointed acting CEO in December, when Koketso Choma, who graduated just three years ago, was in the employ of the company.Shortly after the allegations were published in the Sunday Times, Eskom issued a statement, saying when Koko became aware of his stepdaughter\u2019s involvement in Impulse International, he asked her to resign as a director and shareholder.\u201cThis was duly done by Ms Choma in September and October 2016. Thus no legal obligation for Mr Koko to declare his interest,\u201d Eskom added.Choma was also a beneficiary and trustee of Mokoni Trust, which has an interest in Impulse International.

Doing so would have potentially impacted the sanctity of the investigation,\u201d said Eskom chairperson Baldwin Ngubane in a statement.\"We allowed Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr a free hand to appoint an entity to undertake a forensic aspect of the investigation. All this was a deliberate attempt on our part to enhance the effectiveness of the investigation,\" he said.

REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst/File Photo By Jonathan Stempel \nThe U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday announced a crackdown against alleged stock promotion schemes in which writers were secretly paid to post hundreds of bullish articles about public companies on financial websites. \nTwenty-seven individuals and entities, including a Hollywood actress, were charged with misleading investors into believing they were reading \"independent, unbiased analyses\" on websites such as Seeking Alpha, Benzinga and Wall Street Cheat Sheet. \nAccording to the SEC, many writers used pseudonyms such as Equity Options Guru, The Swiss Trader, Trading Maven and Wonderful Wizard to hype stocks. \nThe regulator said had it identified more than 450 problem articles, of which more than 250 falsely said the writers were not being paid. \n\"This is different from the fraud cases that you usually see us bring,\" Stephanie Avakian, acting director of the SEC enforcement division, said on the conference call. \n\"Here, we allege that the fraud was in presenting the analysis as impartial,\" she said. \"It was bought and paid for.\" \nSeventeen defendants including Galena Biopharma Inc, ImmunoCellular Therapeutics Ltd and Lion Biotechnologies Inc agreed to pay more than $4.8 million, including fines and restitution, to settle, and to refrain from further wrongdoing. \nNot all defendants were required to make payments, and Galena, ImmunoCellular and Lion did not admit wrongdoing. None of the websites was charged. \nThe SEC filed lawsuits against the other 10 defendants in Manhattan federal court. \nThese defendants include Lidingo Holdings LLC, run by Kamilla Bjorlin, 46, an actress from Encino, California who performs under the name Milla Bjorn; and CSIR Group LLC, a New York firm overseen by Christine Petraglia, 49. \nIt is unclear whether those defendants have hired lawyers. A lawyer representing Lidingo and Bjorlin in separate litigation had no immediate comment. CSIR and Petraglia did not immediately respond to requests for comment. \nThe SEC also issued an alert warning investors that articles on investment research websites may not be objective and independent, and that they should never invest based solely on information published there. \nMike Taylor, a Seeking Alpha managing editor, said in an email that website's policies \"act as a strong deterrent against potential promotions,\" including documenting \"all authors' claims to not having been compensated by third parties.\" \n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Richard Chang)", "rating": null, "entities": {"organizations": [{"name": "sec", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "business news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "galena biopharma inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s. securities and exchange commission", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "immunocellular therapeutics ltd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "csir group llc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lidingo holdings llc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "csir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lion biotechnologies inc", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "richard chang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "milla bjorn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lion", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike taylor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kamilla bjorlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "benzinga", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "christine petraglia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stephanie avakian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "petraglia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonathan stempel", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "manhattan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lidingo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "galena", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bjorlin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "encino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hollywood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington, dc", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "title": "SEC targets fake stock news on financial websites", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "crawled": "2017-04-10T20:13:35.229+03:00", "external_links": [], "thread": {"uuid": "8ba0cc079c47cedba0db2d3d23c7bf1d95e5da08", "title_full": "SEC targets fake stock news on financial websites", "social": {"pinterest": {"shares": 7}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 594, "shares": 594, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 70}, "gplus": {"shares": 18}}, "section_title": "Reuters: Business News", "site_categories": ["news", "finance"], "title": "SEC targets fake stock news on financial websites", "site_full": "www.reuters.com", "main_image": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170410&t=2&i=1180111692&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED3915P", "country": "US", "domain_rank": 408, "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "performance_score": 5, "published": "2017-04-10T20:13:35.229+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqBzELvywyQz70CHWvrRucputIi8P.8HqZP1k4LfoB7AAIg--", "site_section": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/businessNews\r", "site": "reuters.com", "spam_score": 0.0}, "published": "2017-04-10T20:13:35.229+03:00", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqBzELvywyQz70CHWvrRucputIi8P.8HqZP1k4LfoB7AAIg--"}, {"uuid": "d5bb4efb01c79f181c5d7bb136f774c43b8653d1", "author": "Mark Thompson", "text": "Barclays CEO pay slashed after he tried to identify whistleblower by Mark Thompson @MarkThompsonCNN April 10, 2017: 3:50 AM ET Banks fined billions over forex rigging The boss of one of Britain's biggest banks will have his pay slashed after he admitted trying to unmask a whistleblower. \nBarclays said in a statement that CEO Jes Staley tried to identify the author of a letter that the bank was treating as an attempt to report wrongdoing. \nFollowing an investigation by the Barclays ( BCS ) board and an external law firm, the bank said it had concluded that Staley had \"honestly, but mistakenly believed that it was permissible to identify the author of the letter.\" \n\"It will therefore be issuing a formal written reprimand to Mr. Staley and has decided that a very significant compensation adjustment will be made to Mr. Staley's variable compensation award,\" it said in the statement. \nStaley's total pay came to \u00a34.2 million ($5.2 million) in 2016, including bonus, benefits and pension payments. According to the bank's annual report, he could have made more than \u00a37 million in 2017, including bonuses. \nJust how much Staley loses will be determined once U.K. financial regulators have concluded an investigation into his behavior and the bank's approach to dealing with whistleblowers. \nStaley said he had apologized to the bank's board. \nBarclays gave no details as to the nature of the whistleblower's actions but said it had accepted Staley's explanations that he was \"trying to protect a colleague who had experienced personal difficulties in the past from what he believed to be an unfair attack.\" \nThe bank said it would not comment further while the regulators continued their investigation. \nBarclays shares were off by as much as 1% in early London trading.

They were executed when deadlines to pay ransoms expired. \nPresident Rodrigo Duterte says Islamic State is trying to gain a foothold in the restive southern Philippines, an impoverished, underdeveloped and predominantly Muslim region fraught by insurgency. \nHe has pleaded with Philippine separatist groups to reject advances of extremists.

The white supremacist sentenced to death in federal court for the 2015 shooting massacre at a historic black church in South Carolina is expected to plead guilty to separate state murder charges on Monday. \nDylann Roof, 23, is charged in state court with murdering nine African American parishioners as they closed their eyes in prayer at a Bible study session. \nRoof agreed to plead guilty in state court under a deal with prosecutors after being convicted of 33 federal crimes, including hate crimes and obstruction of religion resulting in death.

Macron responded, on Sud Radio: \"Mr Fillon is a man of little worth.\"\nMeanwhile Melenchon's support jumped seven percentage points to 19 percent in a monthly Ifop-Fiducial poll for Paris March and Sud Radio, putting him in third place ahead of Fillon.\nHe is also targeting Macron's voters -- but this time those to the left or centre-left.\nMelenchon and Fillon, on 19 percent and 18.5 percent, respectively, still lag Le Pen on 24 percent and Macron on 23 percent.

The couple are formally being investigated by magistrates. \nHe again accused the Socialist led-government of helping to spread the allegations on Tuesday. \nA daily Opinionway poll showed Macron winning the second round against Le Pen, with Melenchon in fourth place right behind Fillon in the first round.\n\n(Reporting by Sarah White, Sophie Louet and Helene Dauschy; Editing by Ingrid Melander/Jeremy Gaunt)", "rating": null, "entities": {"organizations": [{"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sud radio", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "melenchon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "jean-luc melenchon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sarah white", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "francois fillon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ingrid melander/jeremy gaunt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "helene dauschy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sophie louet", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "emmanuel macron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fillon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "le pen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "le pen-melenchon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pierre gattaz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gattaz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marine le pen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macron", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "title": "Leftist Melenchon surges as French election candidates bicker", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "crawled": "2017-04-11T14:46:56.098+03:00", "external_links": [], "thread": {"uuid": "866acfb1aaf285913dddeb25d2407a23b1a35f6d", "title_full": "Leftist Melenchon surges as French election candidates bicker | Reuters", "social": {"pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 579, "shares": 579, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 5}}, "section_title": "Reuters: World News", "site_categories": ["news", "finance"], "title": "Leftist Melenchon surges as French election candidates bicker", "site_full": "www.reuters.com", "main_image": "http://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170411&t=2&i=1180213211&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED3A0S4", "country": "US", "domain_rank": 408, "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 1, "site_type": "news", "performance_score": 5, "published": "2017-04-11T14:46:56.098+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqBzGyZ9TnVIMurUQvBqtOftmlyDNGyiDoYyuyD.SDBUc1g--", "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/reuters/euzPJ", "site": "reuters.com", "spam_score": 0.0}, "published": "2017-04-11T14:46:56.098+03:00", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqBzGyZ9TnVIMurUQvBqtOftmlyDNGyiDoYyuyD.SDBUc1g--"}, {"uuid": "28c4b0074bb0058999f6479f6996f0eb74bf301d", "author": "", "text": "New York offers free college tuition. So do these countries by Alanna Petroff @AlannaPetroff April 10, 2017: 9:56 AM ET 5 stunning stats about college debt Is New York taking a page from Europe's education playbook? \nStarting this fall, undergraduate students who attend a two or four-year public college will be eligible for free tuition if their families earn no more than $100,000 a year. Tens of thousands of students are set to benefit. \nNo other U.S. state offers the same deal. But in Europe, some countries have been offering similar benefits for years. \nHere's a rundown of some countries where residents have their higher education financed by the state: \nGermany: Regional governments across Germany have all abolished tuition over the past few years . \nInternational students are also able to enroll without paying tuition. \nCzech Republic: Czech students get a free pass at universities, but they have to study in the local language. And students have to start paying if they stay too long, which is generally a year beyond the standard length of their degree. \nSweden: The Nordic country offerstuition-free public education to citizens pursuing higher education, and the offer is also extended to students from the European Union. Other international students aren't eligible. \nNordic countries, known for their low tuition costs, also have high tax rates. \n\"Higher education is seen as one of these [services] that should be free,\" said Thomas Estermann, director of governance, funding and public policy development at the European University Association. \nDenmark , Norway and Finland also offer free tuition. Many European countries offer tuition-free education to university students. \nIceland: The vast majority of university students in this small island nation are enrolled in public institutions, which charge no tuition fees. The few who attend private schools have to pay, but the Icelandic Student Loan Fund provides loans with interest rates that are capped at 1%. \nHowever, Icelandic universities charge students registration fees that are sometimes higher than tuition in other European countries, notes Estermann. The registration fees generally cost about $700. \nFrance: France technically charges tuition to undergraduate students, but the fees are so small that they can be lower than the registration fees in other nations, explained Estermann. \nStudents studying for their Bachelor's degree pay about \u20ac200 ($212) annually. \n\"No one considers them tuition, but still, in name, they are tuition fees ... but they could be classified as registration fees,\" he said. \nEstonia: The small country overhauled its rules in 2014 so that all degree programs taught in the local language are free of charge for full-time students. Students who fall behind in their studies have to pay tuition. \nOnly about 11% of students have student debt and the average annual amount of loan per student is just below $3,500, according to The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.

That ignited large street protests and sparked calls from hundreds of leading academics and international partners for the legislation to be scrapped. \n(Reporting by Marton Dunai and Gergely Szakacs; editing by Mark Heinrich)", "rating": null, "entities": {"organizations": [{"name": "central european university", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mti", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "soros", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mark heinrich", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george soros", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marton dunai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gergely szakacs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "janos ader", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters/laszlo balogh", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "viktor orban", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "hungary", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "budapest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "budapest hungary", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "title": "Hungarian president signs law that could shut Soros university", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "crawled": "2017-04-10T21:04:16.997+03:00", "external_links": [], "thread": {"uuid": "5dbe7b9547da5b17cd3c187ca9888ccf92975bd4", "title_full": "Hungarian president signs law that could shut Soros university", "social": {"pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 549, "shares": 549, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 15}, "gplus": {"shares": 4}}, "section_title": "Reuters: Top News", "site_categories": ["news", "finance"], "title": "Hungarian president signs law that could shut Soros university", "site_full": "www.reuters.com", "main_image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170410&t=2&i=1180117433&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED3919T", "country": "US", "domain_rank": 408, "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "performance_score": 5, "published": "2017-04-10T21:04:16.997+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqByUcXTOOUIj43YhHFZP.gIPjogpvnaL.26K9XK.Di_T2oJ_aqFAnPGt", "site_section": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/topNews\r", "site": "reuters.com", "spam_score": 0.0}, "published": "2017-04-10T21:04:16.997+03:00", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqByUcXTOOUIj43YhHFZP.gIPjogpvnaL.26K9XK.Di_T2oJ_aqFAnPGt"}, {"uuid": "84f4d0eda6b5e877e0bee38ae062bf86e37ef0ee", "author": "", "text": "World News | Sun Apr 9, 2017 | 4:11pm EDT Stockholm attack suspect is Uzbek denied residency in Sweden left right Tow trucks pull away the beer truck that crashed into the department store Ahlens after plowing down the Drottninggatan Street in central Stockholm, Sweden, April 8, 2017.

REUTERS/Police/Handout/TT News Agency 4/4 By Johan Sennero , Philip O'Connor and Nerijus Adomaitis | HJULSTA, Sweden \nHJULSTA, Sweden The arrested man suspected by police of killing four people by ramming a truck into crowds in Stockholm is a 39-year-old from Uzbekistan who had been denied permanent residency in Sweden and who had expressed sympathy for Islamic State. \nTwo sources who had worked with the suspect, Rakhmat Akilov, independently identified him to Reuters from images distributed by police as the manhunt got underway on Friday. \nTwo police spokespersons declined to confirm his identity as did the suspect's court-appointed lawyer. \nA former co-worker of Akilov contacted by Reuters said Akilov had never expressed any religious views and also said that the man he shared a flat with near Stockholm was said to be \"devastated\" to hear Akilov may be responsible for the attack. \nAkilov was detained at around 9 p.m. local time (1900 GMT) on Friday in a northern Stockholm suburb hours after police say he hijacked a truck and plowed through a pedestrian shopping street in central Stockholm, killing four and injuring 15. [nL8N1HG04J] \nPolice said he had previously turned up in information gathered by Swedish security services. \"He was a marginal character,\" said Sweden's national police chief Dan Eliasson. He did not figure in any of their investigations immediately prior to the attack. [nS3N1FT00S] [nS3N1FT00U] \nPolice have also said the suspect had shown sympathies for extremist organizations, including Islamic State and that he was wanted for failing to comply with a deportation order after his application for residency was denied. \nAkilov's former co-worker, who had worked with him at a construction company in Sweden and did not wish to be named, said Akilov was a father who sent money home to a wife and several children living in Uzbekistan. \nSwedish Security Police spokesman Simon Bynert said the suspect had been involved in an asylum process in Sweden, but that the security police had not been part of it. \nAkilov's Facebook page shows he was following a group called \"Friends of Libya and Syria\", dedicated to exposing \"terrorism of the imperialistic financial capitals\" of the United States, Britain and Arab \"dictatorships\". \nThe page features two videos, one on the double standards on what constitutes terror and how Muslims are victimized, and the other about a man with his family in the Iraqi city of Mosul calling others to join radical group Islamic State. \nHis Facebook page showed he also liked Playboy magazine and Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova. The page suddenly became unavailable on Saturday. \"Sorry, this content isn't available at the moment,\" a message said. \nAkilov worked at the construction company for a few months last year. \n\"He never expressed any radical or religious views. He was like any normal guy,\" the former co-worker at the company told Reuters. \nHe said that Akilov's flatmate in Varberg, south of Stockholm, was devastated and moved out as soon as he heard reports Akilov may have been involved in the attack. \nAkilov -- or someone with the same name -- appears to be listed as living at another address in the northern Stockholm suburb of Hjulsta. No one replied to enquiries at that address when a Reuters reporter visited the low-rise red building with white balconies overlooking a children's playground. \nAkilov was also following a group on Facebook calling for the removal of former Uzbek president Islam Karimov, who died last September, as well as a group giving information on how to emigrate to the United States and Canada. \nAkilov's Facebook page listed him as born in the Uzbek city of Samarkand, the central Asian country's second-largest city and one of the main stops on the ancient Silk Route. \nThe top picture on Akilov's Facebook page showed the Sher-Dor Madrasa in Samarkand's Registan Square. \n(Additional reporting by Mansoor Yosufzai, Niklas Pollard, Anna Ringstrom, Johannes Hellstrom, Johan Ahlander Bjorn Rundstrom and Daniel Dickson in Stockholm, writing by Gwladys Fouche and Alister Doyle, editing by Susan Fenton)", "rating": null, "entities": {"organizations": [{"name": "edt stockholm", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "ekstromer/tt news agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islamic state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maja suslin/tt news agency/via reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tt news agency", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "playboy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "security police", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "simon bynert", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johan ahlander bjorn rundstrom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "anna ringstrom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maria sharapova", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "akilov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "susan fenton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alister doyle", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johannes hellstrom", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "philip o'connor", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rakhmat akilov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gwladys fouche", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dan eliasson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johan sennero", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mansoor yosufzai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jonas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "islam karimov", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nerijus adomaitis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sher-dor madrasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "daniel dickson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "niklas pollard", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "stockholm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sweden", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "varberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "uzbekistan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tow", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stockholm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ahlens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "libya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "registan square", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samarkand", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hjulsta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sweden  hjulsta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hjulsta", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "drottninggatan street", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mosul", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "title": "Stockholm attack suspect is Uzbek denied residency in Sweden", "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "crawled": "2017-04-09T23:44:30.325+03:00", "external_links": [], "thread": {"uuid": "84f4d0eda6b5e877e0bee38ae062bf86e37ef0ee", "title_full": "Stockholm attack suspect is Uzbek denied residency in Sweden", "social": {"pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 500, "shares": 500, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 4}}, "section_title": "ABC News (US)", "site_categories": ["news", "finance"], "title": "Stockholm attack suspect is Uzbek denied residency in Sweden", "site_full": "www.reuters.com", "main_image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170409&t=2&i=1179999207&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED380R2", "country": "US", "domain_rank": 408, "replies_count": 0, "participants_count": 0, "site_type": "news", "performance_score": 5, "published": "2017-04-09T23:44:30.325+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqBweAsNDSljkcJ3.2HKpG30OShFqiCqnl7bsuqs_eD29wUDhP9qLMOsP", "site_section": "http://www.newslookup.com/rss/us/top/tv/abcnews.rss", "site": "reuters.com", "spam_score": 0.0}, "published": "2017-04-09T23:44:30.325+03:00", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqBweAsNDSljkcJ3.2HKpG30OShFqiCqnl7bsuqs_eD29wUDhP9qLMOsP"}, {"uuid": "149cd1cc48f7e952846ed524eb152c7b064c1166", "author": "<a href=\"/journalists/sarah-n-lynch\">Sarah N.

McMaster said Syria's \"sponsors,\" Russia and Iran, were enabling President Bashar al-Assad's \"campaign of mass murder against his own civilians.\"\nBut Tillerson, who is expected to visit Moscow on Wednesday for talks with Russian officials, said on ABC's 'This Week' program there was \"no change\" to the U.S. military posture toward Syria.\n\"I think the real failure here has been Russia's failure to live up to its commitments under the chemical weapons agreements that were entered into in 2013,\" Tillerson said.\n\"The failure related to the recent strike and the recent terrible chemical weapons attack in large measure is a failure on Russia's part to achieve its commitment to the international community,\" he added.\nU.S. President Donald Trump ordered cruise missile strikes on a Syrian air base after he blamed Assad for the chemical attack, which killed at least 70 people, many of them children, in the Syrian town of Khan Sheikhoun. The Syrian government has denied it was behind the attack.\nSpeaking on \"Fox News Sunday,\" McMaster said the United States would take further action in Syria if necessary. \n\"We're prepared to do more. In fact, we were prepared to do more two days ago,\" McMaster said. \"The president will make whatever decision he thinks is in the best interests of the American people.\"\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Iran's Hassan Rouhani said in a phone call that aggressive U.S. actions against Syria were not permissible and violated international law, the Kremlin said.\nMcMaster said Russian leaders were supporting \"a murderous regime\" and their actions would dictate the future of U.S.-Russian relations.\n\"Do they want it to be a relationship of competition and potential conflict,\" McMaster said. \"Or do they want it to be a relationship in which we can find areas of cooperation that are in our mutual interest?\"\nTillerson stopped short of accusing Russia of direct involvement in planning or carrying out the attack, saying he had not seen \"any hard evidence\" to suggest Moscow was an accomplice to Assad.\nBut he said the United States expected Russia to take a tougher stance by rethinking its alliance with Assad because \"every time one of these horrific attacks occurs, it draws Russia closer into some level of responsibility.\"\n\n(Reporting by Sarah N.
