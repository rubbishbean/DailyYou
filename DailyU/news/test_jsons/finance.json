REUTERS/Andrew Yates 11/11 By Elizabeth Piper , Kylie MacLellan and William James | LONDON \nLONDON British Prime Minister Theresa May called on Tuesday for an early election on June 8, saying she needed to strengthen her hand in divorce talks with the European Union by bolstering support for her Brexit plan. \nStanding outside her Downing Street office, May said she had been reluctant to ask parliament to back her move to bring forward the poll from 2020. But, after thinking \"long and hard\" during a walking holiday, she decided it was necessary to try to stop the opposition \"jeopardising\" her work on Brexit. \nSome were surprised by May's move - the Conservative prime minister has repeatedly said she does not want to be distracted by campaigning - but opinion polls give her a strong lead and the British economy has so far defied predictions of a slowdown. \nGrowth is faster than expected, consumer confidence is high and unemployment low, but the economy may be poised to pass its peak as consumers start to feel the strain from rising prices. \nSterling rose to a four-month high against the U.S. dollar GBP=D4 after the market bet that May would strengthen her parliamentary majority, which Deutsche Bank said would be a \"game-changer\" for the pound. \nBut the stronger pound helped push Britain's main share index .FTSE to close down 2.3 percent, its biggest one-day loss since June 27, days after Britain voted to leave the EU. \n\"It was with reluctance that I decided the country needs this election, but it is with strong conviction that I say it is necessary to secure the strong and stable leadership the country needs to see us through Brexit and beyond,\" May said. \n\"Before Easter I spent a few days walking in Wales with my husband, thought about this long and hard, and came to the decision that to provide that stability and certainty for the future that this was the way to do it, to have an election,\" she told ITV news. \nMay called U.S. President Donald Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other European leaders after the announcement, a spokesman said, without giving details of the conversations. \nRUNAWAY LEAD \nBritain joins a list of western European countries scheduled to hold elections this year. Votes in France in April and May, and in Germany in September, have the potential to reshape the political landscape around the two years of Brexit talks with the EU expected to start in earnest in June. \nMay is capitalising on her runaway lead in the opinion polls and she could win around 100 additional seats in parliament. \nA survey conducted after May's announcement put her Conservative Party 21 points ahead of the main opposition Labour Party. The ICM/Guardian poll of 1,000 people showed Conservative support at 46 percent, with Labour on 25 percent and the Liberal Democrats on 11 percent. \nMay's personal ratings also dwarf those of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, with 50 percent of those asked by pollster YouGov saying she would make the best prime minister. Corbyn wins only 14 percent. \nMay, a former interior minister, was appointed prime minister after Britain's vote to leave the European Union forced the resignation of her predecessor David Cameron. The election will be a vote on her performance so far. \nShe is counting on winning the support of British voters, who backed Brexit by 52-48 percent. Some Britons questioned on social media whether they wanted to cast yet another ballot less than a year after the June referendum and two years after they voted in the last parliamentary poll. \nHowever, the ICM/Guardian poll found that around three in five respondents said May was right to call an election. \nHer spokesman said she had the backing of her top team of ministers and had informed Queen Elizabeth of her plans on Monday. \nBusiness groups largely welcomed the move, while expressing concern that the government's focus may stray away from the economy, which May said had defied \"predictions of immediate financial and economic danger\". \nUnderlining divisions the vote is unlikely to mend, however, Nicola Sturgeon, first minister of the Scottish government, described the decision as a \"huge political miscalculation\" that could help her efforts to hold a new independence referendum. \nThe government of the Irish Republic also expressed concern that the early election could damage the chances of resolving a political crisis in the British province of Northern Ireland. \nIrish Prime Minister Enda Kenny was among the leaders called by May, along with European Council President Donald Tusk. \nTusk, who is running the negotiations with Britain, said in Brussels that the election was a Brexit plot twist worthy of Alfred Hitchcock - the late film director known as the master of suspense. \nBefore holding the early election, May must win the support of two-thirds of the parliament in a vote on Wednesday, which looked certain after Labour and the Liberal Democrats said they would vote in favour. \nLabour's Corbyn welcomed the election plan, but some of his lawmakers doubted whether it was a good move, fearing they could lose their seats. At least two said they would not run. \nIf the opinion polls are right, May will win a new mandate for a series of reforms she wants to make and also a vote of confidence in a vision for Brexit which sees the country outside the EU's single market. \n\"The decision facing the country will be all about leadership,\" May said. \"What they are doing jeopardises the work we must do to prepare for Brexit at home, and it weakens the government's negotiating position in Europe.\" \n(Additional reporting by Elisabeth O'Leary in Edinburgh, Kate Holton and Andy Bruce in London, editing by Sonya Hepinstall and David Stamp)", "title": "PM May to make statement outside Downing Street office", "uuid": "cc882d40baab219a07aee710b9ac92f6cd2ab698", "thread": {"title": "PM May to make statement outside Downing Street office", "domain_rank": 408, "site_full": "uk.reuters.com", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "site": "reuters.com", "published": "2017-04-18T12:10:44.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/Mx2PHH_4C23Hx5x5mO3ytR2ETjc6BWrboTi_pBlJ7SDtMcjxeidrzpCr9PoQGr3Imp0oJZfXvaRvpT870MKydw--", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/UKdomesticNews", "uuid": "cc882d40baab219a07aee710b9ac92f6cd2ab698", "performance_score": 9, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 998, "comments": 0, "shares": 998}, "linkedin": {"shares": 55}, "gplus": {"shares": 4}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170418&t=2&i=1181008188&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED3H0FN", "title_full": "PM May to make statement outside Downing Street office", "section_title": "Reuters: UK", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "puerto rico", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "west virginia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "massachusetts", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guam", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alaska", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north bonneville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nevada", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "katie lobosco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "vegas strip recreational", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "justice department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marijuana policy project", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new frontier", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-19T23:03:46.000+03:00", "author": "Aaron Smith", "published": "2017-04-19T23:03:46.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGlfE6_B6LKpCzSvFsZr7lT9zIL28GpOTCMNnP6hqUULYRnRfE2f5egDr0PofHU0.y", "text": "10 things to know about legal pot by Aaron Smith @AaronSmithCNN April 20, 2017: 8:36 AM ET Will recreational marijuana soon be legal nationwide? Recreational marijuana -- the kind you smoke without a doctor's note -- wasn't legal anywhere in the United States five years ago. \nSince then, voters in eight states and Washington, D.C., have given it the green light . \nSales of legal pot grew to $6.6 billion in 2016, according to New Frontier , a research company that analyzes the marijuana industry. That includes $4.7 billion for medical marijuana and $1.9 billion for recreational. The industry as a whole is projected to exceed $24 billion by 2025. \nBut there are rules for where you can buy pot and who can smoke it. \nRelated video: Will recreational weed soon be legal nationwide? \nHere's what you need to know for 4/20, the annual pot holiday: \n1. Anyone 21 or older can buy recreational marijuana in Colorado, Washington and Oregon. Pot shops for recreational marijuana have been open for business in Colorado and Washington since 2014, and in Oregon since 2015. \n2. You can possess pot and get high legally in eight states and Washington, D.C., as long as you're 21. Recreational marijuana was legalized last year in Alaska, California, Maine, Massachusetts and Nevada . It was legalized in Washington, D.C., in 2015. But recreational dispensaries haven't been established in all those places yet, and state and local authorities are still working out rules for taxation and zoning. If you want to grow your own, check local laws first, because they vary from state to state. \nRelated: 4/20 is Black Friday for marijuana merchants \n3. Medical marijuana is legal in 29 states. According to the Marijuana Policy Project, a pro-legalization group, medical marijuana is legal in 29 states and Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and Guam. West Virginia became the 29th on Wednesday, the day before 4/20, when the governor signed medical marijuana into law. In 18 other states, medical marijuana laws are so restrictive that the MPP considers them \"ineffective or flawed.\" \n4. You can still be fired for smoking marijuana. Even if you show up for work as sober as a judge, you can be fired for flunking a drug test in most states. This has happened to some medical patients . \nRelated: Pot businesses worry about Trump, but expect to prevail \n5. The government owns and operates a pot store. The city of North Bonneville, Washington, opened the Cannabis Corner in 2015. It's the first municipally owned pot shop. Profits go to special city projects, like upgrading the local playground. \n6. There's a black market for pot, even where it's legal. That's not just because old habits die hard. Illegal pot is cheaper because it's tax-free, while legal recreational pot is taxed heavily. There's a 28% tax in Colorado and a 37% tax In Washington. In Oregon, the tax ranges between 17% and 20%, depending on the city and county. Growers, processors, retailers and buyers all pay taxes. Medical marijuana tends to be cheaper than recreational because it is taxed at a lower rate. \nRelated: Weed is legal in Nevada, but you won't find it on the Strip \n7. Banking is a buzzkill for pot shops. Pot remains illegal in the eyes of the federal government, which classifies it the same as heroin. Banks are regulated by the feds, which means that most banks won't go near dispensaries , forcing many of them to deal in cash. In 2014, the Justice Department issued guidelines for banks on how to legally provide financial services to state-licensed marijuana businesses. But many banks remain wary of weed. \n8. You can't take marijuana across state lines. Even when two legal states share a border, as Washington and Oregon do, carrying weed across state lines runs afoul of federal law.

But there's no breathalyzer for weed, a conundrum for cops. \n10. You can't smoke weed in public anywhere.

The news was discussed by Howard Kurtz, Fox's media analyst, during a segment on the network's 6 p.m. program \"Special Report.\"\nThe repercussions of O'Reilly's departure had been discussed during the previous hour, during which the hosts of \"The Five\" talked about the programming changes made in the wake of O'Reilly's departure -- all without mentioning O'Reilly's name. (\"The Five\" is shifting to 9 p.m., while one of its co-hosts, Eric Bolling, will host his own program at 5 p.m.)\nBy that time, the news had already generated considerable coverage on Fox's primary cable news competitors, CNN and MSNBC. It was also the top story on the websites of the New York Times and the Washington Post.\nRelated: Bill O'Reilly out at Fox News\nKurtz had filed a story on Fox's website earlier in the afternoon, but it didn't get mentioned on-air until he appeared Wednesday. After the news of O'Reilly's departure was introduced by \"Special Report\" anchor Bret Baier, Kurtz paraphrased much of his digital story.\nHe called O'Reilly \"the biggest star in the 20 year history at Fox News,\" but said that some female staffers at the network had grown \"uncomfortable\" with the idea of him staying on board.\nThe announcement, Kurtz told viewers, came in a \"terse statement\" earlier in the afternoon from Rupert Murdoch and his sons, James and Lachlan, the owners of Fox News's parent company, 21st Century Fox.\nThe news was also addressed during O'Reilly's old 8 p.m. hour, which on-screen graphics called \"The Factor.\"\nSubstitute host Dana Perino -- who had been one of O'Reilly's fill-ins during the vacation he has been on and was supposed to return from -- began the show by saying, \"Before we get to the other big stories of the day, we want to address a situation many of you may already be aware of. Bill O'Reilly, who hosted this program for 20 years, is leaving the Fox News Channel. We know that you, his very loyal viewers, will have a lot of feelings about this and we will talk more about it later on in the program.\"\nPerino returned to the subject at the very end of the show.\n\"It is the end of an era here at the Fox News Channel,\" she said. \"As we mentioned earlier, Bill O'Reilly is leaving this chair, and this network, after more than 20 years. Bill has been the undisputed king of cable news, and for good reason. He is an incredibly talented broadcaster who raised the bar for interviewers everywhere. He has also held his staff to exacting standards in his quest to put the best possible program on the air, and they are great. And you, his audience, responded in record numbers, making 'The Factor' the number one cable news show for more than 16 years. You have also been loyal, and we can't tell you how much that means to everyone on 'The Factor.'\"\nThe reasons for his departure were not mentioned.\nRelated: What will Bill O'Reilly do now?\nFox had for weeks largely ignored the scandal that ultimately brought O'Reilly down.\nFollowing the New York Times' report on April 1 that five women received settlements after accusing O'Reilly of sexual harassment or verbal abuse, Fox covered it only once: a brief mention on Kurtz's weekly media criticism program the day after the story was published.\nElsewhere in the media, though, the revelation was a big topic among journalists and media executives, with many wondering if O'Reilly -- long seen as invincible for his ability to weather previous controversies -- might actually lose his job. It also prompted dozens of companies to drop advertisements on \"The O'Reilly Factor,\" long the most watched show on cable news.\nBut Fox was mostly silent. O'Reilly never addressed the Times report on his show, and none of his colleagues at the network defended him publicly.\nThe muted response stood in stark contrast to how O'Reilly defended himself against sexual harassment allegations back in 2004, and the scorched earth counteroffensive mounted last summer by supporters of former Fox News chief Roger Ailes after he faced his own harassment allegations.\nKurtz discussed the Ailes matter on-air more extensively than he did the O'Reilly controversy. And when Ailes was forced into a resignation in July, it was Kurtz who announced it on air.\nCNNMoney (New York) 19, 2017: 8:34 PM ET", "title": "How Fox News broke the Bill O'Reilly story to its viewers - Apr. 19, 2017", "uuid": "9ed99a7a6d732ca6a9d3dc30fa1883447c153978", "thread": {"title": "How Fox News broke the Bill O'Reilly story to its viewers - Apr. 19, 2017", "domain_rank": 81, "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "site": "cnn.com", "published": "2017-04-20T03:50:22.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGlfE6_B6LKpDEfJMBc5a2TUCH37Rof_bSx4H1Y5s1IF_adIJI3QKre0SINFmyPoSq.T5O7G5ZZhs-", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "", "uuid": "9ed99a7a6d732ca6a9d3dc30fa1883447c153978", "performance_score": 9, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 985, "comments": 0, "shares": 985}, "linkedin": {"shares": 6}, "gplus": {"shares": 11}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.002, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170403151333-bill-oreilly-seated-780x439.jpg", "title_full": "How Fox News broke the Bill O'Reilly story to its viewers - Apr. 19, 2017", "section_title": "", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "farmville", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san jose convention center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "udacity", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cleveland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "paris", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san jose", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "mark zuckerberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sheryl sandberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rachel rubin franklin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zuckerberg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "instagram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook groups", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook spaces", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook ( fb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "delegated account recovery", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-19T00:05:57.000+03:00", "author": "Heather Kelly and Selena Larson", "published": "2017-04-18T23:41:00.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGA3.NJT5K_1aVplQZ0eI9tCJbU01g.42VmRf7EyHuTuuOR5NKKfuxqR0wSKXXmwGS", "text": "Facebook Spaces: Never see your friends IRL again Facebook just built a virtual reality version of ... Facebook. Mark Zuckerberg kicked off Facebook's annual F8 developer conference on Tuesday. The two-day event, now in its tenth year, drew roughly 4,000 attendees to the San Jose Convention Center in California. \nThis year, the company announced new augmented reality features for your smartphone camera, a cute VR version of the social network for Oculus and even more ways to talk to companies on Messenger. \nZuckerberg tests out his standup routine \nThe conference is a chance for Zuckerberg and his executives to wax poetic about all they ways they're changing the world, while also getting brands excited to sell things on Facebook. \nNewish dad Zuckerberg tried out something different on stage: dad jokes. He made cracks about the other F8 trending this week, \"The Fate of the Furious,\" and joked about his overly long community posts. \n\"I wrote like six more of these, but I understand that some of you are here to see a tech keynote,\" said Zuckerberg. He reinforced Facebook's commitment to building community, before speaking briefly about the Cleveland murder video that was uploaded to Facebook. \nRelated: Mark Zuckerberg makes cursory mention of Facebook murder video at F8 \nAugmented reality is already on your phone \nHe quickly pivoted to the main thrust of his keynote: augmented reality, but without the dorky glasses. \nFacebook is using its new camera tools to launch its own augmented reality platform. Instead of putting on goggles, you will hold up your smartphone and watch as it overlays graphics on the world in front of you in real time. \nYou can add sharks swimming around your morning coffee, or a virtual mug to your table to feel less alone. Add effects to a room, like dripping paintings or rain clouds, and pop-up informational boxes for products or locations. It uses precise location detection, 3D effects and object recognition to make the moving effects work. \nThe platform is available in a closed beta starting Tuesday. \nFacebook's new camera update already uses some of this \"augmented reality,\" like animated mustaches and glitter beards. Zuckerberg acknowledged that the company was late adding the camera effects to its apps, but said, \"I'm confident that now we're going to push this augment reality platform forward.\" Snapchat released similar features Tuesday morning -- the latest shot in the war between the two companies. \nRelated: Facebook is still trying to make bots happen \nFacebook Spaces means you never have to leave your home again \nLast year, Facebook did a silly demo on stage of people hanging out in virtual reality, taking selfies. It was a rough draft for Facebook Spaces, a new virtual reality version of Facebook the company announced today. \nFacebook Spaces is an app for the Facebook-owned Oculus VR goggles. Facebook described it as \"a magical canvas for shared experiences.\" \nWhen you can't just chill on the couch with your bestie IRL, you can put on some goggles and do it as animated people in a virtual version of your living room. Or in a virtual park, Paris, maybe even outer space if you're into that. \nRachel Rubin Franklin, the former head of the Sims video game franchise, said it lets you spend time with people and gives \"the essence that you're really there together.\" \nThe app ports in your Facebook profile, so it already knows who your friends are. If you don't have Oculus (most people don't), you can see a VR version of yourself talking to your friends' VR versions. You can build a custom avatar based on your Facebook profile shot, like a 3D bitmoji. This is the future, folks. \nVR social networks and communities already exist, and they're experiencing the same etiquette questions as social networks. For instance, one woman was sexually assaulted while playing a video game in VR. \nFacebook Spaces launches in beta for Oculus Rift Tuesday. \nForgot your password? Facebook's got your back \nFacebook is expanding its efforts to eliminate passwords. In January, the company began testing Delegated Account Recovery, a tool that lets you use your Facebook account to log in to another app if you forgot your password. \nInstead of answering security questions or receiving password reset emails, people can use Facebook to confirm their identity. The security tool is now rolling out to more apps as a closed beta test. \nNew communities just for developers \nFacebook also announced a number of new tools just for developers. Since coding can be a lonely undertaking, Facebook is launching Developer Circles. They're like Facebook Groups for developers, helping connect people living in the same area and offering educational options like special classes from Udacity. There are new analytics tools and more location information to draw from. Developers can now build simplified pages and apps for people who have slow internet connections. \nYear one of a 10-year plan \nA lot has changed since F8's first installment. Over the past decade, Facebook ( FB , Tech30 ) has gone from a single website where people play Farmville to a public company that also owns Instagram, Oculus and What'sApp. \nAt last year's F8, Zuckerberg took a subtle swipe at then-candidate Trump, saying, \"Instead of building walls, we can help build bridges.\" In the first few months of Trump's presidency, Zuckerberg has expressed concern about Trump's executive orders on immigration. COO Sheryl Sandberg has also criticized Trump on his abortion policies . \nOn the heels of the campaign, Zuckerberg made it his New Year's resolution to visit people from every state by the end of 2017 -- though he did not specifically mention Trump as a factor. The U.S. election also put fake news and its impact on real-life decisionmaking in the spotlight. Zuckerberg initially said it was \"crazy\" that Facebook could have impacted the election, though later backtracked on his comments. \nCNNMoney (San Jose)   18, 2017: 12:50 PM ET", "title": "Facebook finally makes a virtual reality world 18,", "uuid": "c24d62c0aed419d55dd7f3c9c8f87337fb87220f", "thread": {"title": "Facebook finally makes a virtual reality world 18,", "domain_rank": 81, "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "participants_count": 1, "replies_count": 0, "site": "cnn.com", "published": "2017-04-18T23:41:00.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGA3.NJT5K_1aVplQZ0eI9tCJbU01g.42VmRf7EyHuTuuOR5NKKfuxqR0wSKXXmwGS", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_technology.rss", "uuid": "c24d62c0aed419d55dd7f3c9c8f87337fb87220f", "performance_score": 9, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 981, "comments": 0, "shares": 981}, "linkedin": {"shares": 51}, "gplus": {"shares": 15}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170418132746-facebook-f8-pic1-780x439.jpg", "title_full": "Facebook finally makes a virtual reality world - Apr. 18, 2017", "section_title": "Technology news - CNNMoney.com", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": ["https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864", "https://smartasset.com/snippet.js", "http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/publications/world-population-prospects-2015-revision.html", "http://grist.org/food/climatarian-vegavore-reducetarian-why-we-have-so-many-words-for-cutting-back-on-meat/", "https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/03/the-economic-case-for-worldwide-vegetarianism/475524/", "http://theplate.nationalgeographic.com/2016/01/13/to-really-reduce-meat-in-your-diet-dont-go-cold-turkey/", "https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/farm-practices-management/irrigation-water-use/background.aspx", "http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM", "https://www.google.com/search?q=vegetarisn+save+money&oq=vegetarisn+save+money&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.2727j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3257660/", "http://www.onegreenplanet.org/animalsandnature/factory-farming-animal-cruelty/", "https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/fruit-and-vegetable-prices/", "https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list?qlookup=16017", "https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/search/list?qlookup=16016", "https://plantbasedfoods.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/PBFA-Econ-Report-2016.pdf", "http://reducetarian.org/book", "https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/the-leader-of-the-reducetarian-movement-reckons-we-should-all-eat-less-meat-2", "https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/meat-price-spreads/"], "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.d states", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "brian kateman", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "marketwatch people", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "american dietetic association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "plant-based foods association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marketwatch adding", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reducetarian foundation", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "food and agriculture organization of the united nations", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "impossible foods", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-18T12:34:57.000+03:00", "author": "Brian Kateman", "published": "2017-04-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.87ohzHzuPF_yWpWy60ceBMY5195Osq5gfjCn2pbK03nnFE3FNIBh1RjEZlUhpdnNwcYlcqHCsLVlKipQP2yDgklYHeZGa3flthTFoUA4iQlI4hGJjI_.P6i4M6itGH5OkOWPT6QH4UGxb4GUADUHZiBH5pY9DUUJ5C9semOoDvA--", "text": "Getty Images Originally Published By: \nPeople cut meat from their diets for many reasons \u2014 health, animal welfare, the environment, among others. There is a growing number of individuals who are reducing their intake of animal products to better themselves and the planet. According to a recent survey, 35% of Brits are eating less meat than they did a year ago. This holds true for Americans, too. \nThe term \u201creducetarian\u201d celebrates this trend in people choosing to eat fewer animal products. It unites vegans and vegetarians (people who eat less meat, just to such a degree that they eat none at all) with everyone who eats less meat than a typical omnivore. And it replaces static and self-defeating identifiers like \u201clazy vegan\u201d and \u201ccheating vegetarian\u201d with more positive ones. Reducetarians work to cut down their carnivorous consumption by gradually reducing their meat, egg, and dairy intakes. They play around with Meatless Monday, Vegan Before Six, and Weekday Vegetarianism to see what works best for them. \nHere are seven reasons this flexible and easy approach to eating will help you become a happier, healthier, and richer person: \n1. You will lower your grocery bill. \nA family of four may spend anywhere from $760 \u2013 $1160 a month for groceries. Vegetables, fruits and plant-based protein are some of the cheapest products on the market, not to mention the best return in nutrient value. The average retail price for beef is about $6/lb ($8/lb for sirloin) whereas $1.49 for a pound of black beans. With 15 g of protein and fiber per cup, your wallet and body will thank you. In fact, one study showed that the average vegetarian saves at least $750 per year on his or her grocery bill. \n2. You will cut down on your carbon footprint. \nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, animal agriculture accounts for approximately 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions \u2014 that\u2019s more than the entire transportation sector combined. But plant-based foods have a much lower carbon footprint than animal-based foods. That\u2019s why the average vegetarian has half the carbon footprint of a meat eater; and for a vegan, it\u2019s even lower. Cutting down on meat is an easy way to help mitigate climate change. \n3. You will help fight world hunger. \nIn 2015, world population reached a staggering 7.3 billion and is expected to hit 8.5 billion by 2030. This increase in mouths to feed creates a rising demand for food. The inefficiencies of feeding plants to raise animals for food instead of feeding these plants directly to people contributes to world hunger. For example, it requires 9 calories of feed for chickens to create 1 calorie from poultry. A decrease in livestock production, as well as a decrease in land to grow crops to feed these animals, will help combat this critical issue. \n4. You will help conserve water. \nJust one pound of meat requires roughly 2,500 gallons of water \u2013 that\u2019s 10 times the amount of water required to grow one pound of grain protein. This would mean that the water used to make one burger is equivalent to the amount of water used when showering for two whole months (assuming a four minute daily shower). It\u2019s no surprise that animal agriculture accounts for 80% to 90% of U.S. water consumption. With drought-stricken areas on the rise, reducing your consumption of meat can help conserve our precious water. \n5. You will be saving farm animals from cruelty. \nFactory farmed livestock live in inhumane and cruel conditions. From extremely crowded cages to harming of animals through practices like \u201cde-beaking,\u201d over 95% of the meat that we find in our grocery store comes from these horrible places. Reducing your consumption of animal products will help lessen the demand for them. \n6. You will save money on medical bills. \nThe American Dietetic Association declared that \u201cappropriately planned\u201d reducetarian diets, including vegetarian and vegan diets, will provide you with the nutrition you need to stay healthy as well as aid in prevention of certain diseases. Evidence suggests that following a plant-based diet will lower your risk of heart disease, a leading cause of death in the U.S.d States. Furthermore, reducing your meat consumption may help lower your cholesterol levels and blood pressure as well as your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. Given how expensive it is to treat these non-communicable diseases, eating less meat could save you thousands of dollars in health care bills. On a global scale, changing your diet could contribute to saving around $700 million in health care, unpaid informal care and lost working days. \n7. You will fuel a growing revolution of start-ups and investment in good food companies. \nAs the plant-based industry continues to grow, so does its economic value. The Plant-Based Foods Association estimates the industry\u2019s annual revenue is roughly $4.9 billion dollars and is expected to keep growing. More than 2,000 jobs (that pay better than many other jobs ) are added to this sector every year. Supporting plant-based companies like Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat will not only benefit your taste buds, but also the economy. \nBrian Kateman is editor of \u201cThe Reducetarian Solution: How The Surprisingly Simple Act of Reducing The Amount of Meat in Your Diet Can Transform Your Health and The Planet,\u201d co-founder and president of the Reducetarian Foundation, a non-profit organization dedicated to reducing meat consumption to create a healthy, sustainable, and compassionate world. He is a TEDx speaker and leading expert on food systems and behavioral change.

In four years, Agranoff has grown his idea to make custom-design athletic socks into a profitable online-only business with annual sales of more than $1 million. \nAgranoff's lightbulb moment came in 2013 at a high-school basketball game, where he noticed most kids were wearing the same plain Nike athletic socks. If these simple socks started such a craze, he wondered: What would happen if he kicked things up a notch and printed custom designs on them? Brennan Agranoff, founder and CEO of custom socks startup HoopSwagg. \nRelated: An Indian technologist creating factory jobs in America \nFast forward four years, and HoopSwagg now offers more than 200 original designs created by Agranoff himself: a mix of goofy (a melting ice cream cone), funky (a spoof of the infamous Portland International Airport carpet) and tongue-in-cheek (\"goat farm,\" a family inside joke scattered with photos of the real animals on the family's property). Agranoff also wants to allow customers to create their own designs in the future. \nThe company is now shipping 70 to 100 orders a day, with each pair of socks priced at $14.99. And this week, HoopSwagg announced its first acquisition: It bought competitor TheSockGame.com, which will add over 300 designs to the portfolio and help expand HoopSwagg's customer base. HoopSwagg ships its custom socks to customers nationwide. \nBut HoopSwagg started small. After Agranoff's initial idea at the school basketball game, he spent six months researching logistics like machinery and technology needed for custom digital printing on fabric. \nHe then made the case to two potential investors: his parents. \"They thought the concept was a little out there,\" Agranoff said. But he was persistent and ultimately received a $3,000 loan. \nIn true startup fashion, HoopSwagg launched in the family garage in Sherwood, Oregon, just outside of Portland. Agranoff set up the design printing and heat presser machines with his family's help. He enlisted his parents to buy \"as many white athletic socks as they could get from Dick's Sporting Goods.\" \nHoopswagg's first year was slow. But momentum grew quickly after the socks -- which Agranoff said are \"for everyone from 6-year-olds to 80-year-olds\" -- took off on social media. \nRelated: Stores are scooping up this nut-free ice cream \nAgranoff leveraged his own social network and targeted a group of social influencers to help spread the word . In particular, the sock design inspired by the Portland airport's former teal-and-geometric-shape pattern went viral, bringing more attention to the brand. \nAs sales soared, the company quickly outgrew the garage. The Agranoff family built a 1,500-square-foot building on their property to accommodate production, warehousing and shipping. Agranoff in his new 1,500 square feet warehouse on the family's property. \nHis mother joined the business full-time, and Agranoff also has 17 other part-time employees. But self-sufficiency is key to his success, he said. Agranoff also taught himself to code, so he could better set up and manage his business' website, and how to use graphic design tools to develop the designs. He remains the company's only graphic designer, though he is colorblind. \nRelated: A cloth slow cooker is empowering rural women around the world \nFor now, the socks are primarily sold through HoopSwagg's website and via Amazon ( AMZN , Tech30 ) , eBay ( EBAY ) and Etsy. The next three years are pivotal for HoopSwagg, said Agranoff, who wants the brand to be in retail stores,\" said Agranoff. He's also expanding customization to other products like shoelaces, arm sleeves and ties. \nMeanwhile, Agranoff is set to graduate high school six months early. While college is in the plan at some point, he's slated to focus on HoopSwagg full-time after high school graduation. He currently spends about six hours per day on the business, after putting in a day of school and finishing his homework. \nWhile Agranoff has never taken a business class, he learned a lot by buying items at garage sales and selling them on eBay -- a pursuit he began when he was eight. \n\"So really, I've been learning how to do this for a while,\" said Agranoff. \"Especially today, with all the information available on the internet, you can't be too young to learn how to be an entrepreneur.\" CNNMoney (New York) First published April 20, 2017: 9:20 AM ET ", "title": "High schooler sells $1M in custom socks", "uuid": "392ffa0408d943ae0225aecb712ebc0ff83ff6e0", "thread": {"title": "High schooler sells $1M in custom socks", "domain_rank": 81, "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "site": "cnn.com", "published": "2017-04-20T18:49:08.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGg9eLUWcjPLAqUojzaLZ7EHbW1p0cakZ5n_t3WfGvcfXGNO5C4iHgfI9vUPTKOoVwoYR3Zc6oww.d32At9falIULXAlqx0ISb", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_us.rss", "uuid": "392ffa0408d943ae0225aecb712ebc0ff83ff6e0", "performance_score": 9, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 958, "comments": 0, "shares": 958}, "linkedin": {"shares": 21}, "gplus": {"shares": 17}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170417152739-brennan-agranoff-780x439.jpg", "title_full": "High schooler sells $1M in custom socks", "section_title": "CNN.com - RSS Channel - US", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pemba island", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grand canyon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "zao hot spring", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "planet earth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yamagata", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "kaya yurieff", "sentiment": "negative"}], "organizations": [{"name": "google earth", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasa", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jane goodall institute", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-18T13:57:10.000+03:00", "author": "", "published": "2017-04-18T13:57:10.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGA3.NJT5K_1aVplQZ0eI9tNCzDm7QavV_m6Ga3HkcU1uulrOmww9eSd5TXkxkNmaA", "text": "Google Earth gets a facelift Google Earth is getting a facelift.

That night, the first daughter and her husband, Jared Kushner, sat next to the president of China and his wife for a steak and Dover sole dinner at Mar-a-Lago. \nThe scenario underscores how difficult it is for Trump, who has tried to distance herself from the brand that bears her name, to separate business from politics in her new position at the White House. \nAs the first daughter crafts a political career from her West Wing office, her brand is flourishing, despite boycotts and several stores limiting her merchandise. U.S. imports, almost all of them from China, shot up an estimated 166 percent last year, while sales hit record levels in 2017. The brand, which Trump still owns, says distribution is growing. It has launched new activewear and affordable jewelry lines and is working to expand its global intellectual property footprint. In addition to winning the approvals from China, Ivanka Trump Marks LLC applied for at least nine new trademarks in the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Canada and the U.S. after the election. \nThe commercial currents of the Trump White House are unprecedented in modern American politics, ethics lawyers say. They have created an unfamiliar landscape riven with ethical pitfalls, and forced consumers and retailers to wrestle with the unlikely passions now inspired by Ivanka Trump's mid-market collection of ruffled blouses, shifts and wedges. \nUsing the prestige of government service to build a brand is not illegal. But criminal conflict of interest law prohibits federal officials, like Trump and her husband, from participating in government matters that could impact their own financial interest or that of their spouse. Some argue that the more her business broadens its scope, the more it threatens to encroach on the ability of two trusted advisers to deliver credible counsel to the president on core issues like trade, intellectual property, and the value of the Chinese currency. \n\"Put the business on hold and stop trying to get trademarks while you're in government,\" advised Richard Painter, who served as chief White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush. \nTo address ethical concerns, Trump has shifted the brand's assets to a family-run trust valued at more than $50 million and pledged to recuse herself from issues that present conflicts. \n\"Ivanka will not weigh in on business strategy, marketing issues, or the commercial terms of agreements,\" her attorney, Jamie Gorelick, said in a statement. \"She has retained authority to direct the trustees to terminate agreements that she determines create a conflict of interest or the appearance of one.\" show chapters Wednesday, 5 Apr 2017 | 10:35 AM ET | 00:37 \nIn a recent interview with CBS News, Trump argued that her business would be doing even better if she hadn't moved to Washington and placed restrictions on her team to ensure that \"any growth is done with extreme caution.\" \nChina, however, remains a nagging concern. \"Ivanka has so many China ties and conflicts, yet she and Jared appear deeply involved in China contacts and policy. I would never have allowed it,\" said Norman Eisen, who served as chief White House ethics lawyer under Barack Obama. \"For their own sake, and the country's, Ivanka and Jared should consider stepping away from China matters.\" \nInstead, the first daughter and her husband have emerged as prominent interlocutors with China, where they have both had significant business ties. Last year, Kushner pursued hundreds of millions of dollars in real estate investments from Anbang Insurance Group, a financial conglomerate with close ties to the Chinese state. After media reports about the deal, talks were called off. \nPublicly, Ivanka has taken a gracious, charming approach toward Beijing. During the Mar-a-Lago meetings, her daughter, 5-year-old Arabella stood in a gilded room and sang a traditional Chinese song, in Mandarin, for China's president, Xi Jinping. The video, which was lavishly praised by Chinese state media, played over 2.2 million times on China's popular news portal qq.com. \nThe week of the summit, 3.4 tons of Ivanka Trump handbags, wallets and blouses arrived in the U.S. from Hong Kong and Shanghai. U.S. imports of her merchandise grew an estimated 40 percent in the first quarter of this year, according to Panjiva Inc., which maintains and analyzes global shipping records. \nPainter, the former Bush administration lawyer, recommended full recusal from issues related to trade with China. That is likely to be difficult because trade is so deeply embedded in the US-China relationship and has been linked with other matters, like North Korea. \n\"The danger is that with any discussion with the Chinese, one party or the other may try to bring up trade,\" he said. \"That's a slippery slope that may require her or Jared to step out of the room.\"Gorelick, Ivanka Trump's attorney, said that Ivanka and her husband would steer clear of specific areas that could impact her business, or be seen as conflicts of interest, but are under no legal obligation to step back from huge swaths of policy, like trade with China. \nUnder the rules, Trump would recuse herself from conversations about duties on clothing imported from China, Gorelick said, but not broad foreign policy. \n\"In between, you have to assess it case-by-case,\" she said. \nTrademarks can be signs of corporate ambition, though many countries \u2014 such as China, where trademark squatting is rampant \u2014 also allow for defensive filings to prevent copycats from using a brand. \nTrademarks pose ethical, and possibly legal, implications for government employees because they are granted by foreign states and confer the monopoly right to sell branded product in a particular country \u2014 an entitlement that can be enormously valuable. Intellectual property lawyers say trademarks are also a crucial prerequisite for cutting licensing deals, which form the basis of both Ivanka and Donald Trump's global business strategy. Getty Images Donald Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump. \nToday, Ivanka Trump Marks LLC has 16 registered trademarks in China and 32 pending applications, along with a total of four marks granted preliminary approval since the inauguration, according to China's Trademark Office. Altogether, they cover a wide range of goods and services, including cosmetics, jewelry, leather handbags, luggage, clothes, shoes, retail, spa and beauty services. There is no sign the recent approvals were particularly swift. China's Trademark Office did not respond to a request for comment. \nGlobally, the company has more than 180 pending and registered trademarks in countries including Canada, India, Japan, Israel, Mexico, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, as well as the U.S. and Europe, public records show. In December, the company applied for five trademarks, covering handbags and wallets in Puerto Rico, and lingerie and other clothes in the U.S. After the inauguration, the company filed four more applications, for branded clothing and shoes in the Philippines, and perfume and other items in Canada. \nTrump did not sign off on the new trademark applications, her brand said in a statement, adding that they are \"not necessarily an indication that the brand is planning to launch a category or a store in a specific territory.\" \nWhatever the future plans, right now sales are growing \u2014 helped, some argue, by the glow of Ivanka Trump's political rise. \nThe G-III Apparel Group Ltd., which makes Ivanka Trump clothes, said net sales for the collection increased by $17.9 million during the year that ended Jan. 31. \nThe brand itself claims revenues rose 21 percent last year, with early February seeing some of the \"best performance ever,\" according to a statement by Abigail Klem, president of the Ivanka Trump brand. Because it is privately held, the brand does not have to declare its earnings or where revenues come from. The actual corporate structure of Trump's retail business remains opaque. Kushner's financial disclosure form lists two dozen corporate entities that appear directly related to his wife's brand. Trump herself has yet to file a disclosure. \nData from Lyst, a massive fashion e-commerce platform, indicates some of this growth coincided with specific political events. \nThe number of Ivanka Trump items sold through Lyst was 46 percent higher the month her father was elected president than in November 2015. Sales spiked 771 percent in February over the same month last year, after White House counselor Kellyanne Conway exhorted Fox viewers to \"Go buy Ivanka's stuff.\" Conway was later reprimanded. The bounce appears somewhat sustained.

REUTERS/Toby Melville 6/6 By Elizabeth Piper , Kylie MacLellan and William James | LONDON \nLONDON British Prime Minister Theresa May called on Tuesday for an early election on June 8, saying she needed to strengthen her hand in divorce talks with the European Union by bolstering support for her Brexit plan. \nStanding outside her Downing Street office, May said she had been reluctant to ask parliament to back her move to bring forward the poll from 2020. But, after thinking \"long and hard\" during a walking holiday, she decided it was necessary to try to stop the opposition \"jeopardizing\" her work on Brexit. \nSome were surprised by May's move - the Conservative prime minister has repeatedly said she does not want to be distracted by campaigning - but opinion polls give her a strong lead and the British economy has so far defied predictions of a slowdown. \nGrowth is faster than expected, consumer confidence is high and unemployment low, but the economy may be poised to pass its peak as consumers start to feel the strain from rising prices. \nSterling rose to a four-month high against the U.S. dollar after the market bet that May would strengthen her parliamentary majority, which Deutsche Bank said would be a \"game-changer\" for the pound. \nBut the stronger pound helped push Britain's main share index to close down 2.3 percent, its biggest one-day loss since June 27, days after Britain voted to leave the EU. \n\"It was with reluctance that I decided the country needs this election, but it is with strong conviction that I say it is necessary to secure the strong and stable leadership the country needs to see us through Brexit and beyond,\" May said. \n\"Before Easter I spent a few days walking in Wales with my husband, thought about this long and hard, and came to the decision that to provide that stability and certainty for the future that this was the way to do it, to have an election,\" she told ITV news. \nMay called U.S. President Donald Trump, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other European leaders after the announcement, a spokesman said, without giving details of the conversations. \nRUNAWAY LEAD \nBritain joins a list of western European countries scheduled to hold elections this year. Votes in France in April and May, and in Germany in September, have the potential to reshape the political landscape around the two years of Brexit talks with the EU expected to start in earnest in June. \nMay is capitalizing on her runaway lead in the opinion polls and she could win around 100 additional seats in parliament. \nA survey conducted after May's announcement put her Conservative Party 21 points ahead of the main opposition Labour Party. The ICM/Guardian poll of 1,000 people showed Conservative support at 46 percent, with Labour on 25 percent and the Liberal Democrats on 11 percent. \nMay's personal ratings also dwarf those of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, with 50 percent of those asked by pollster YouGov saying she would make the best prime minister. Corbyn wins only 14 percent. \nMay, a former interior minister, was appointed prime minister after Britain's vote to leave the European Union forced the resignation of her predecessor David Cameron. The election will be a vote on her performance so far. \nShe is counting on winning the support of British voters, who backed Brexit by 52-48 percent. Some Britons questioned on social media whether they wanted to cast yet another ballot less than a year after the June referendum and two years after they voted in the last parliamentary poll. \nHowever, the ICM/Guardian poll found that around three in five respondents said May was right to call an election. \nHer spokesman said she had the backing of her top team of ministers and had informed Queen Elizabeth of her plans on Monday. \nBusiness groups largely welcomed the move, while expressing concern that the government's focus may stray away from the economy, which May said had defied \"predictions of immediate financial and economic danger\". \nUnderlining divisions the vote is unlikely to mend, however, Nicola Sturgeon, first minister of the Scottish government, described the decision as a \"huge political miscalculation\" that could help her efforts to hold a new independence referendum. \nThe government of the Irish Republic also expressed concern that the early election could damage the chances of resolving a political crisis in the British province of Northern Ireland. \nIrish Prime Minister Enda Kenny was among the leaders called by May, along with European Council President Donald Tusk. \nTusk, who is running the negotiations with Britain, said in Brussels that the election was a Brexit plot twist worthy of Alfred Hitchcock - the late film director known as the master of suspense. \nBefore holding the early election, May must win the support of two-thirds of the parliament in a vote on Wednesday, which looked certain after Labour and the Liberal Democrats said they would vote in favor. \nLabour's Corbyn welcomed the election plan, but some of his lawmakers doubted whether it was a good move, fearing they could lose their seats. At least two said they would not run. \nIf the opinion polls are right, May will win a new mandate for a series of reforms she wants to make and also a vote of confidence in a vision for Brexit which sees the country outside the EU's single market. \n\"The decision facing the country will be all about leadership,\" May said. \"What they are doing jeopardizes the work we must do to prepare for Brexit at home, and it weakens the government's negotiating position in Europe.\" \n(Additional reporting by Elisabeth O'Leary in Edinburgh, Kate Holton and Andy Bruce in London, editing by Sonya Hepinstall and David Stamp) ", "title": "British PM May to make statement outside Downing Street office", "uuid": "9ab441978c8e54a445211a50c47c519ef7089dd0", "thread": {"title": "British PM May to make statement outside Downing Street office", "domain_rank": 408, "site_full": "www.reuters.com", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "site": "reuters.com", "published": "2017-04-18T12:22:13.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqByEXEsKSbsfVkeAdfbEaK1ecpcupj1F5HnS2CVGNw.aQw--", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/worldNews?format=xml", "uuid": "9ab441978c8e54a445211a50c47c519ef7089dd0", "performance_score": 9, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 914, "comments": 0, "shares": 914}, "linkedin": {"shares": 57}, "gplus": {"shares": 17}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170418&t=2&i=1181008767&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED3H0FS", "title_full": "British PM May to make statement outside Downing Street office", "section_title": "Reuters: World News", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "u.k.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "alanna petroff", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "sugam pokharel @cnnmo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "vijay mallya", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mallya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "\u2014 vijay mallya", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "richard branson", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "london's metropolitan police", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kingfisher airlines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kingfisher", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diageo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united spirits", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-18T15:32:25.000+03:00", "author": "Alanna Petroff", "published": "2017-04-18T15:32:25.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGA3.NJT5K_1a3d921gXdzwVOT7kRPQNJCrSFewewny3K4t9m6jFU2pY13AT8yHijSa0p6ORTBJ4bkXoH0Q7KWzg--", "text": "Indian business tycoon Vijay Mallya arrested in the U.K. by Alanna Petroff and Sugam Pokharel @CNNMoney April 18, 2017: 1:05 PM ET Indian tycoon arrested in the U.K. The law has finally caught up with Indian tycoon Vijay Mallya. \nThe flamboyant businessman was arrested on Tuesday in the U.K., months after being accused of fraud by Indian authorities. \nLondon's Metropolitan Police confirmed that Mallya was arrested on an extradition warrant after surrendering himself at a police station. \nHe will appear before a judge later on Tuesday. \nThe 61-year-old beer baron -- who has been described as the Richard Branson of India -- has become a poster child for unpaid debts in his home country. \nMallya took over the chairmanship of his father's massive Kingfisher beer company back in 1983 and eventually bought stakes in his own F1 team and cricket franchise. \nHe also founded the defunct Kingfisher Airlines.

The number of vets lacking coverage fell to 552,000, down from 980,000. \nThe changes startedin 2014, when two major Obamacare coverage provisions kicked in. That's when Medicaid expansion took effect and the Obamacare exchanges opened. Most uninsured veterans had incomes that would make them eligible either for Obamacare subsidies or Medicaid. \nVeterans eligible for Medicaid expansion -- individuals earning up to $16,400 -- saw the largest drop in uninsured rates. Prior to Obamacare, some 21.6% of these vets lacked coverage. By 2015, this share fell to 12.2%. The declines were largest in the states that expanded Medicaid. \nRelated: Trump sends mixed signals on Obamacare \nVeterans who qualify for subsidies on the Obamacare exchanges -- a single person earning up to $47,500 -- also saw declines. Some 10.6% were uninsured in 2013, but only 6.6% were two years later. \nVeterans' families also benefited from Obamacare. The uninsured rate among spouses fell to 5.5% from 9.2%, while the rate among children fell to 2.9% from 4.5%. \nThe majority of uninsured vets were older than age 45, and half of them worked full-time. \nThe Urban Institute report came out the same day President Trump signed an executive order extending the Veterans Choice Program, an Obama administration initiative that allows veterans unable to get timely care at a Veterans Administration facility to go to a non-VA provider.

But it has one major hurdle to jump: U.S. sanctions. Exxon has asked the U.S. Treasury Department for permission to bypass sanctions on Russia, as The Wall Street Journal first reported. A senior administration official told CNN that the request \"has been in the works for some time,\" since before the election. \nA waiver would allow Exxon to resume its joint venture with Russian oil giant Rosneft. \nExxon said it does not comment on \"ongoing issues.\" \nBut there are powerful reasons why Houston-based Exxon would want to get back into business with the state-backed firm: Their agreement to form a joint venture, signed in 2011, allowed Exxon to conduct offshore exploration in the Black Sea and the Kara Sea in Siberia. \nThe undeveloped oil fields are thought to be the most promising in the Russian Arctic, according to S&P Global Platts. \nIn 2012, the two firms agreed to jointly develop more oil reserves in Siberia and establish a research center in the Arctic. \nPlans to build a large natural gas plant near Vladivostock in eastern Russia followed in 2013. \nThe deepening relationship was put on hold, however, after the U.S., European Union and other Western countries imposed sanctions on Russia in 2014 over its role in the crisis in Ukraine. \nExxon, which has been operating in Russia for more than 20 years, was allowed to finish some of its projects. But then the drilling stopped. \nA lot has changed since then. The Russian economy has turned the corner, emerging from a painful recession in the final quarter of 2016. \nOil prices have climbed back above $50 per barrel. \nRelated: Russia could soon control a U.S. oil company \nStill, the waiver request is a major political gambit for Exxon. \nThe Trump administration is under intense scrutiny over its ties to Moscow. The fact that the current secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, spearheaded the Rosneft deal while CEO of Exxon, has drawn even more attention to the waiver request. \nTillerson has recused himself from all government matters involving Exxon. He also sold all his stock in the firm, and is placing the shares he would have received over the next decade into an independently managed trust . \nBut a political storm appears to be brewing. \nSen. John McCain, a Republican, asked \"Are they crazy?\" when news of the waiver application broke. McCain is a leading critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. \nAre they crazy? @WSJ : \"Exxon Seeks U.S. Waiver to Resume #Russia Oil Venture\" https://t.co/CHKS3sjOa8 \n\u2014 John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) April 19, 2017 \nRep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intel Committee, said that the waiver should be denied. \n\"The Treasury Department should reject any waiver from sanctions which would allow Exxon Mobile or any other company to resume business with prohibited Russian entities,\" he said in a statement. \"Until Russia abides by the Minsk accords and ends its illegal occupation of Crimea, the only changes to sanctions should be their intensification, not their dilution.\" \nStill, the financial incentives for Exxon are powerful when it comes to Russia. \nIn March of 2016, Tillerson said that Exxon was \"very anxious to get back to work there.\" \nIt's a hope echoed by his successor. \n\"In Russia, we're there for the long term,\" CEO Darren Woods said in a February interview with Forbes . \n--CNN Elise Labott contributed to this report. \nCNNMoney (London)   20, 2017: 10:49 AM ET", "title": "Why ExxonMobil would want to get back into Russia", "uuid": "40de06458facc7d0f83d48f195ed1690df780be4", "thread": {"title": "Why ExxonMobil would want to get back into Russia", "domain_rank": 81, "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "site": "cnn.com", "published": "2017-04-20T18:04:45.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGg9eLUWcjPLAprAK1saIaC3wszcJC3HJWZyiequddbDy3g0iWQfr3O8qBx.Iv4Dg3EFEIUbO3VZdNOGzjI4T9lYTpWL4hj8CP", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_topstories.rss", "uuid": "40de06458facc7d0f83d48f195ed1690df780be4", "performance_score": 8, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 895, "comments": 0, "shares": 895}, "linkedin": {"shares": 12}, "gplus": {"shares": 7}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/161213085531-tillerson-russia-putin-exxon-780x439.jpg", "title_full": "Why ExxonMobil would want to get back into Russia", "section_title": "Business and financial news - CNNMoney.com", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "turkey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aegean", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "izmir", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "diyarbakir", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "korun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "shadia nasralla", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jeremy gaunt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alev korun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters/osman orsal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tayyip erdogan", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "edt observer", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "reuters world news", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "orf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "council of europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peoples' democratic party", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-18T12:56:12.000+03:00", "author": "", "published": "2017-04-18T12:56:12.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqByoQNs0kJyYXOee9npDg15VdfQbJ7ZUUG0SoFNq47u6J296iTFWWxkyjKvcprkzxs5z_gWoBQi3yw--", "text": "World News | Tue Apr 18, 2017 | 2:37pm EDT Observer says 2.5 million Turkish referendum votes could have been manipulated A man casts his ballot at a polling station during a referendum Aegean port city of Izmir, Turkey, April 16, 2017. REUTERS/Osman Orsal \nVIENNA/BERLIN Up to 2.5 million votes could have been manipulated in Sunday's Turkish referendum that ended in a close \"yes\" vote for greater presidential powers, an Austrian member of the Council of Europe observer mission said on Tuesday. \nHowever Turkish authorities are not cooperating with efforts to investigate claims of possible election fraud, according to a senior official in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which conducted a separate monitoring mission. \nTurkish President Tayyip Erdogan has dismissed criticisms of the vote, saying foreign observers should \"know their place\". The foreign ministry said foreign monitors lacked objectivity and impartiality. \nThe mission of observers from the 47-member Council of Europe, the continent's leading human rights body, had already pronounced the referendum to be an uneven contest. Support for \"Yes\" dominated campaign coverage, and the arrests of journalists and closure of media outlets silenced other views, according to Council of Europe and OSCE monitors. \nAlev Korun, an Austrian member of the Council's observer team, said there were questions about the actual voting as well. \n\"This is about the fact that actually the law only allows official voting envelopes. The highest election authority decided however - as it were, against the law - that envelopes without official stamp should be admitted,\" she told ORF radio. \n\"There is a suspicion that up to 2.5 million votes could have been manipulated,\" added Korun, a Greens member of the Austrian parliament. That number of votes would be almost double the margin of Erdogan's victory. \nMichael Georg Link, who headed the OSCE observer mission, said Turkey was not helping an investigation into possible irregularities, and Ankara's questioning of OSCE neutrality was \"clearly politically motivated\". \nHe declined comment on a possible change in the result of the referendum after any recount, but said the election commission's decision to allow incorrectly or non-stamped envelopes was a definite violation of Turkish law. \n\"Unfortunately we cannot talk about any cooperation,\" Link told the RND German newspaper chain. \"Erdogan's decision to extend the state of emergency for 90 days and comments in which the election commission has already rejected claims of manipulation send a clear message.\" \nElection authorities said preliminary results showed 51.4 percent of voters had backed sweeping new powers for Erdogan, something he says is needed to prevent instability. \nTurkey's main opposition began a battle on Tuesday to annul the referendum. \nKorun said police in the majority Kurdish town of Diyarbakir hindered two of her colleagues from entering voting locations. She also pointed to social media videos that seem to show people voting more than once, although this still had to be proven. \n\"These complaints are to be taken very seriously and they are, in any case, of such an extent that they would turn around the outcome of the vote,\" Korun said. \nThe pro-Kurdish opposition Peoples' Democratic Party said it presented complaints about unstamped ballots affecting 3 million voters, more than twice the margin of Erdogan's victory. \n(Reporting by Shadia Nasralla in Vienna and Andrea Shalal in Berlin; editing by Mark Heinrich) ", "title": "Observer says 2.5 million Turkish referendum votes could have been manipulated | Reuters", "uuid": "b228e15609e63e23b911e1fa784bc5d2ac5d1101", "thread": {"title": "Observer says 2.5 million Turkish referendum votes could have been manipulated | Reuters", "domain_rank": 408, "site_full": "www.reuters.com", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "site": "reuters.com", "published": "2017-04-18T12:56:12.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqByoQNs0kJyYXOee9npDg15VdfQbJ7ZUUG0SoFNq47u6J296iTFWWxkyjKvcprkzxs5z_gWoBQi3yw--", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "", "uuid": "b228e15609e63e23b911e1fa784bc5d2ac5d1101", "performance_score": 8, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 893, "comments": 0, "shares": 893}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 3}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.276, "main_image": "http://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170418&t=2&i=1180999484&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED3H0AC", "title_full": "Observer says 2.5 million Turkish referendum votes could have been manipulated | Reuters", "section_title": "", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": []}, "crawled": "2017-04-19T02:24:17.000+03:00", "author": "Editor - Finance Top Stories", "published": "2017-04-19T02:24:17.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgy5Fc689.h046sRBv2S9PHOQ59dAOZBVnK_1oymiHcIgTv2599v1vpuDoGmvbi_PBlZVx2FEE1JEMMM3h9hKakDZKs9u0sbgiNy3ENkqeXPF1l08nvrLG0R", "text": "By Scott Malone | BOSTON \nClose to 20,000 Massachusetts criminal drug cases are set to be dismissed because of a scandal involving a former state chemist who admitted faking tests, civil liberties activists and prosecutors said on Tuesday. \nIt will mean the largest number of drug cases tossed out in U.S. history due to one person, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. Rogue chemist Annie Dookhan pleaded guilty in 2013 to tampering with evidence during her nine years working at a state crime lab in Boston. The scandal shook the foundation of the state\u2019s criminal justice system. \nThe Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court in January ordered prosecutors across the state to dismiss the vast majority of convictions tied to that lab, where Dookhan identified evidence as illegal narcotics even without testing it, in an effort to make herself seem more efficient. \n\u201cToday is a major victory for justice and fairness, and for thousands of people in the commonwealth who were unfairly convicted of drug offenses,\u201d said Matthew Segal, legal director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, which represented many of the defendants during the appeal process. \n\u201cThe victims of this crisis waited far too long for justice. It shouldn\u2019t have taken years of litigation by the ACLU, public defenders, and pro bono lawyers to address this stain on the Commonwealth\u2019s justice system,\u201d Segal said. \nProsecutors in Massachusetts\u2019 Suffolk County, which includes Boston, said on Tuesday they had opted to stand by the prosecution of just 1.5 percent of the cases they had brought involving Dookhan. \n\u201cThe average defendant has more than 60 entries on his record,\u201d County District Attorney Daniel Conley said, referring to the cases his office would still pursue. \u201cThey are neither low-level nor non-violent, and they stand at the intersection of drugs and violence.\u201d \nThose cases also rely on evidence not linked to the now-shuttered lab where Dookhan worked, Conley said. \n(Reporting by Scott Malone; Editing by Peter Cooney) Share This:", "title": "Thousands of Massachusetts drug cases to be dismissed after lab scandal", "uuid": "bcfbc1606f2b6f98bcf672466221fc8c58204c44", "thread": {"title": "Thousands of Massachusetts drug cases to be dismissed after lab scandal", "domain_rank": 408, "site_full": "feeds.reuters.com", "participants_count": 1, "replies_count": 0, "site": "reuters.com", "published": "2017-04-19T02:24:17.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgy5Fc689.h046sRBv2S9PHOQ59dAOZBVnK_1oymiHcIgTv2599v1vpuDoGmvbi_PBlZVx2FEE1JEMMM3h9hKakDZKs9u0sbgiNy3ENkqeXPF1l08nvrLG0R", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "http://www.rocketnews.com/category/top-stories/feed/", "uuid": "bcfbc1606f2b6f98bcf672466221fc8c58204c44", "performance_score": 8, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 871, "comments": 0, "shares": 871}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "title_full": "Thousands of Massachusetts drug cases to be dismissed after lab scandal", "section_title": "Top Stories \u2013 RocketNews |Top News Stories From Around the Globe", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "oregon", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "englewood", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sin city", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "colorado", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "d.c.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "denver", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "washington", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "aaron smith", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "grant pettrie", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "stuart titus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "seth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "viviani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "craig", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "justin viviani", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fuchs", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "medical marijuana, inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vegas strip marijuana", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "green man cannabis", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new frontier", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-20T14:11:15.000+03:00", "author": "Aaron Smith", "published": "2017-04-20T14:11:15.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGg9eLUWcjPLBVnMqoz6KDFdadDq6twkLSVWNbdi7OAND5apUst_KWur9VnZ.guBol0KSG_8_K0z9YzQWaurkP8A--", "text": "You won't find this vice on the Vegas Strip Marijuana entrepreneurs are capitalizing on 4/20, the annual pothead holiday, as an opportunity to sell even more weed than usual. \"This is our industry's Oktoberfest and New Year's Eve all combined into one,\" said Dr. Stuart Titus, CEO of Medical Marijuana, Inc., a California-based online purveyor of hemp oil who's offering a 4/20 discount of 35%. \nWhy did April 20 became the annual celebration for cannabis?

In Colorado, Oregon and Washington state, all of which have had a legal recreational market for years, 4/20 has taken on the trappings of a de facto sales holiday, like Valentine's Day for florists and jewelers or New Year's for health clubs and liquor stores. \nNectar, a company that just opened its eighth dispensary in Oregon, is maxing out staff for 4/20 and offering discounts. Related: The vice that's not welcome in Sin City \n\"Yes, 4/20 really does show a large increase in sales,\" said Justin Viviani, manager of The Oregon Weedery, a dispensary in Portland. \"Last year 4/20 was on Wednesday, traditionally our slowest day of the week, and we saw a 300% increase in visits and sales.\" \nViviani said he'll be offering discounts on new products, as well as live music at the dispensary with free \"non-medicated\" snacks. \nThis year, 4/20 is on a Thursday, which puts it closer to the weekend. Viviani believes this could lead to even stronger sales, so he's stocking up. \n\"We will be heavily staffed with extra budtenders that day,\" he said. \"We package our own flower and craft our own joints so we will be doing a lot of pre-work just to stay stocked.\" \nRelated: Trump is a buzzkill for pot stocks \nIt's not just dispensaries that see extra business around 4/20. Retailers that sell smoking implements, marijuana-themed clubs and smoking rooms and producers of cannabis products like edibles and tinctures also get boosts. \nAccording to New Frontier , a research company that analyzes the marijuana industry, sales on 4/20 tend to be several times higher than on other days, and discounts play a role in driving that. \nIn classic Black Friday fashion, many retailers offer 4/20 discounts of up to 30% for medical marijuana, and up to 50% for recreational, according to Pettrie of Potguide.com. \n\"This is a really good time to stock up on product,\" he said. \nGreen Man Cannabis, a company with two dispensaries in Denver, fuels the 30% sales bump it has seen on 4/20 with discounts of nearly 50% on pre-rolled joints and 20% on marijuana purchases of at least a quarter-ounce. \nToast isn't offering 420 deals because the CEO is casting his cannabis cigarettes as luxury products. Native Roots, a company with 14 dispensaries in Colorado, is marking 4/20 with its \"smokin' token promotion,\" where any customer buying an ounce of marijuana during the month of April could potentially win 12 free ounces, distributed one per month over the next year. \nBut not everyone is jumping on the 4/20 band wagon. Punit Seth, CEO and co-founder of the newly released marijuana brand Toast, isn't offering any discounts for his $85 10-packs of cannabis cigarettes. \n\"4/20 is almost like St. Patrick's Day for alcohol; it's about getting as messed up as possible,\" said Seth, whose web site depicts models in suits and furs puffing weed in a chic-looking lounge. \"We want our product to be held in a different light.\" \nCNNMoney (New York)   7:04 AM ET", "title": "4/20 Day is Black Friday for marijuana merchants - Apr. 20, 2017", "uuid": "7675af019099227fa99a221a5f837b0e5d45bfc7", "thread": {"title": "4/20 Day is Black Friday for marijuana merchants - Apr. 20, 2017", "domain_rank": 81, "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "site": "cnn.com", "published": "2017-04-20T14:11:15.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGg9eLUWcjPLBVnMqoz6KDFdadDq6twkLSVWNbdi7OAND5apUst_KWur9VnZ.guBol0KSG_8_K0z9YzQWaurkP8A--", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "", "uuid": "7675af019099227fa99a221a5f837b0e5d45bfc7", "performance_score": 8, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 870, "comments": 0, "shares": 870}, "linkedin": {"shares": 12}, "gplus": {"shares": 8}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.282, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170418140338-2014-cannabis-cup-780x439.jpg", "title_full": "4/20 Day is Black Friday for marijuana merchants - Apr. 20, 2017", "section_title": "", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sydney  sydney australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "white australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "peter dutton", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "swati pandey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "michael perry", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "parliament house", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-18T08:31:16.000+03:00", "author": "", "published": "2017-04-18T08:31:16.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqBzn8O6bm7JiZjiuiRzSuwkFppBCC84Um1TIbE3mugLYMGdV2ZoUddDv", "text": "World News | Tue Apr 18, 2017 | 6:08am EDT Australia toughens foreign worker visas, says Australian jobs for Australians Australia's Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull speaks as Immigration Minister Peter Dutton listens on during a media conference at Parliament House in Canberra, Australia, April 18, 2017. AAP/Lukas Coch/via REUTERS By Swati Pandey | SYDNEY \nSYDNEY Australia will abolish a temporary work visa popular with foreigners and replace it with a new programme requiring better English-language and job skills, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said on Tuesday. \nTurnbull, struggling with poor voter approval ratings, rejected suggestions the visa policy change was in response to far-right wing political parties, such as One Nation, demanding more nationalistic policies. \nBut in a Facebook announcement Turnbull said: \"Our reforms will have a simple focus: Australian jobs and Australian values.\" \nIn a similar vein, U.S. President Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Tuesday directing changes to a temporary visa programme used to bring foreign workers to the United States to fill highly skilled jobs. The order is an attempt by Trump to carry out his \"America First\" election campaign pledges. \nTurnbull said the visa change would attract better skilled workers and see Australians employed over cheap foreign workers brought in under the old 457 visa programme. \n\"We are an immigration nation, but the fact remains- Australian workers must have priority for Australian jobs,\" he said. \"We'll no longer allow 457 visas to be passports to jobs that could and should go to Australians.\" \nThe 457 visa was introduced in the 1990s to expedite the entry of business professionals and highly skilled migrants but over time it was opened up to include a broad suite of workers. \nThe programme has become mired in controversy with allegations the visa was being misused by employers to import workers on the cheap, not to fill genuine skill shortages. \n\"We are bringing the 457 visa class to an end. It's lost its credibility,\" Turnbull said at a press conference in Canberra. \nAnyone now in Australia on a 457 visa will not be affected by the new arrangements. \nThe 457 visa, now used by about 95,000 foreign workers, will be replaced by a new temporary visa and the list of occupations that qualify for a visa will be reduced from more than 200. \nThe new visa will be limited to a two-year period and a second four-year visa will require a higher standard of English language. From 1901 to around 1973, Australia restricted non-white immigration under a White Australia policy, which required an English language test. \nThe Australian Industry Group (Ai Group), which represents more than 60,000 businesses, said the changes would improve the integrity of Australia's visa programme. \n\"The temporary skilled visa programme should now be considered as settled without the need for further reviews and disruptive policy change,\" said Ai Group Chief Executive Innes Willox. \nSome experts said the government should focus on boosting education and training systems to address Australia's skills needs. \nThe opposition was not impressed though. Labor leader Bill Shorten tweeted \"the only job Malcolm Turnbull cares about saving is his own.\" \n(Reporting by Swati Pandey; Editing by Michael Perry and Neil Fullick) ", "title": "Australia toughens foreign worker visas, says Australian jobs for Australians", "uuid": "87db82006dd3a4e4a72e8e4c05309fe874b587b4", "thread": {"title": "Australia toughens foreign worker visas, says Australian jobs for Australians", "domain_rank": 408, "site_full": "www.reuters.com", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "site": "reuters.com", "published": "2017-04-18T08:31:16.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqBzn8O6bm7JiZjiuiRzSuwkFppBCC84Um1TIbE3mugLYMGdV2ZoUddDv", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "http://feeds.reuters.com/Reuters/worldNews\r", "uuid": "87db82006dd3a4e4a72e8e4c05309fe874b587b4", "performance_score": 8, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 869, "comments": 0, "shares": 869}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "gplus": {"shares": 2}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170418&t=2&i=1180986101&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED3H070", "title_full": "Australia toughens foreign worker visas, says Australian jobs for Australians", "section_title": "Reuters: World News", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne park", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "belarus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "melbourne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "toronto", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "serena williams", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "joseph ax", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "victoria azarenka", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "grant mccool", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pritha sarkar", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venus", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steve keating", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "steffi graf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alexis ohanian", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kim clijsters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "venus williams", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "margaret court", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-19T20:44:16.000+03:00", "author": "", "published": "2017-04-19T20:44:16.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqBy29UDt1bmXCkT2.hi4Y0ltAwGux6omAeDD2yX2Ns8KyQ--", "text": "Sports News | Thu Apr 20, 2017 | 12:14pm EDT Serena Williams confirms pregnancy left right FILE PHOTO - Tennis - Australian Open - Melbourne Park, Melbourne, Australia - early 29/1/17 Serena Williams of the U.S. poses with the Women's singles trophy after winning her final match.

REUTERS/Thomas Peter/File Photo 5/5 By Frank Pingue \nTennis superstar Serena Williams is pregnant and taking maternity leave through the rest of 2017, expecting to give birth this fall, her spokeswoman said on Wednesday in an announcement that upended a sport the 35-year-old athlete has dominated for the past decade. \nThe confirmation came hours after Williams, due to regain to the No. 1 world ranking next week, set off a day of frenzied speculation with a short-lived selfie posted on social media - posing for a photo in a yellow one-piece swimsuit on Snapchat with the caption: \"20 weeks.\" \nWilliams deleted the photo shortly after it appeared and waited more than six hours to make any public comment, stoking debate among tennis fans about whether or not she was joking. \n\"I'm happy to confirm Serena is expecting a baby this fall,\" Los Angeles-based publicist Kelly Bush Novak said. \nBush Novak told Reuters that Williams intended to sit out the remainder of the 2017 season and return next year. \nWilliams, the world's highest paid female athlete, announced her engagement to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian last December. \nDays ago she seemed to quell speculation about impending motherhood with an Instagram post praising a newly published guidebook for new mothers by former Destiny's Child singer Kelly Rowland, adding in the caption: \"One of these days I hope to apply this (but for now I'll stick to my dog Chip).\" \nIf Williams is indeed 20 weeks into her term, that would mean she was approximately two months pregnant when she captured her record 23rd Grand Slam tournament singles title at the Australian Open in January. \nHer victory over older sister Venus Williams broke a tie with Steffi Graf for the most Grand Slam singles championships in the sport's modern era. Serena Williams has not played since then, citing a knee injury. \nTECHNICALLY A DOUBLES MATCH? \nFans and celebrities reacted with a mixture of awe and glee to Williams' Snapchat post. \n\"Serena Williams was pregnant when she won her 23rd grand slam tournament at the Australian Open. And did not drop ONE SET. Let that sink in,\" wrote Twitter user @noelleharmony. \n\"So Serena cheated,\" Trevor Noah, the host of \"The Daily Show\" on Comedy Central, wrote on his Twitter account. \"Because that's technically a doubles match.\" \nThe Women's Tennis Association congratulated Williams on Twitter before deleting its post. \nTennis' U.S. governing body, the United States Tennis Association, wrote on Facebook, \"Join us in congratulating the GOAT and her fianc\u00e9 Alexis Ohanian on this incredible news!\" referring to Williams with the acronym for \"Greatest of All Time.\" \nResearchers who study pregnancy in high-performing athletes said her training during pregnancy, the speed of her body's recovery after giving birth and her will power are the keys to Williams returning to top-level play. James Pivarnik, a kinesiology professor at Michigan State University, said her muscular build could overcome some of the changes that usually impair performance. \nOther women have left the tour to have children and returned at a high level, although none has done so at Williams' age. Kim Clijsters of Belgium retired and had a child before coming back at age 26 and winning three Grand Slam titles as a mother. \nAustralians Evonne Goolagong and Margaret Court also won Grand Slam titles after having children. \nFormer No. 1 Victoria Azarenka of Belarus, 27, missed most of the 2016 season to have a baby and is expected to return to the tour this summer. \n\"We've seen some other mothers come back ... but will she have enough motivation when she sees that little one?\" former world No. 1 Hall of Famer Tracy Austin said on the Tennis Channel. \"She's already done so much, does she need more?\" \nFor Williams, who commands nearly $29 million in salary and sponsorship earnings, becoming pregnant makes her all the more attractive to corporate sponsors, industry executives said. \nWilliams is the oldest woman to win a Grand Slam singles title and still dominates the tour at an age when most players have retired. \nWilliams, who has played professionally for two decades, first gained the No. 1 ranking in 2002 and has held that spot for more than six years in total. \nSister Venus, 36, has won seven Grand Slam singles titles. \n(Reporting by Frank Pingue in Toronto; Additional reporting by Steve Keating in Toronto, Jonathan Allen in New York and Dan Whitcomb in Los Angeles; Writing by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Richard Chang and Bill Trott)", "title": "Tennis great Serena Williams appears to reveal pregnancy", "uuid": "7b99b09100294b1b906113dcfaa86c7d79c1049e", "thread": {"title": "Tennis great Serena Williams appears to reveal pregnancy", "domain_rank": 408, "site_full": "www.reuters.com", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "site": "reuters.com", "published": "2017-04-19T20:44:16.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqBy29UDt1bmXCkT2.hi4Y0ltAwGux6omAeDD2yX2Ns8KyQ--", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/sportsNews/", "uuid": "7b99b09100294b1b906113dcfaa86c7d79c1049e", "performance_score": 8, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 864, "comments": 0, "shares": 864}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170419&t=2&i=1181218589&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED3I17P", "title_full": "Tennis great Serena Williams appears to reveal pregnancy", "section_title": "Reuters: Sports News", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": ["http://on.wsj.com/2osAxzB"], "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "crimea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bengaluru", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ukraine", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arctic", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "black sea", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "moscow", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rex tillerson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "arathy s nair", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sriraj kalluvila", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "exxon", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "treasury department", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "wsj exxon mobil corp", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "state", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wall street journal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "rosneft", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-19T21:33:38.000+03:00", "author": "Reuters Editorial", "published": "2017-04-19T21:33:38.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqBzHj51pa9IArRUYe6350eDJaBTDrzPGYtL6oaVNPjY1Kd56q8GqXHdUpFaMZ2Zt3u0-", "text": "HOUSTON Exxon Mobil Corp ( XOM.N ) on Wednesday declined to comment on a media report that it is seeking permission from the U.S. government to drill in several areas of the Black Sea banned by U.S. sanctions on Russia.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Exxon had in recent months applied to the U.S. Treasury Department for a waiver to drill with Russian oil producer Rosneft ( ROSN.MM ).

On Tuesday, Trump signed an executive order that directed federal agencies to implement a \"Buy American, Hire American\" strategy . The order included a section geared at immigration reform. \nThe order tasked four department heads (including the Secretary of Labor, who has yet to be confirmed) to suggest reforms to ensure H-1B visas are given to the \"most-skilled or highest paid\" petitioners. Additionally, it asked them to propose new rules and guidance for preventing fraud and abuse of work visas. \nTrump made it clear that he doesn't agree with the fact that H-1Bs are currently doled out under a lottery system. \n\"Right now, H-1B visas are awarded in a totally random lottery -- and that's wrong,\" he said on Tuesday in Wisconsin, where he signed the order. \nThere's an annual quota of 85,000 new H-1B visas (with 20,000 reserved for master's degree holders). Applications opened on April 3 and closed five days later. It was the fifth consecutive year that the cap was met within five days. This year, 199,000 applications were received. \nIt's unclear what exactly the four department heads (State, Justice, Labor and Homeland Security) will be able to accomplish administratively and what will need to be done through congressional legislation. \nRelated: H-1B visa applications decline for first time in 5 years \n\"Although released with ceremonial flair, the order will have no immediate impact on H-1Bs,\" Betsy Lawrence, the director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told CNNTech. \"Many of the changes to the H-1B program contemplated by the administration would require legislative action or rulemaking and would take time to go through the necessary processes.\" \nThere have been several bills introduced in recent months to reform the H-1B visa system, including a bipartisan bill from Senators Chuck Grassley and Dick Durbin who have been pushing to revamp the program for years. Their bill proposed eliminating the lottery in favor of a \"preference system\" so that foreign students educated in the U.S. would get priority. It would give a \"leg up\" to advanced degree holders, those being paid a high wage and those with valuable skills. \nThis proposal aligns with Trump's H-1B rhetoric. \n\"I'm grateful that President Trump has taken my suggestions to heart by taking steps today to protect American workers and preserve limited H-1B visas for truly qualified, high-skilled foreign workers,\" said Grassley in a statement. \nRelated: Australia first: Country overhauls visa program for skilled workers \nH-1B visas are used to fill the U.S. skills gap, but critics, including the Trump administration have voiced concern about abuse of the program. In some cases, outsourcing firms flood the system with applicants, obtaining visas for foreign workers and then contracting them out to tech companies. American jobs are sometimes replaced in the process. \nAttorney Sara Blackwell, who advocates for American workers replaced by foreigner visa holders, said she's \"hopeful.\" \n\"I'm glad President Trump is acknowledging the serious problem.\" \nUnlike the draft executive order leaked in January, the order signed Tuesday did not set out deadlines, although it did ask for proposals \"as soon as practicable.\" \n\"I'm not worried immediately about my clients -- but I am worried about what's to come,\" Tahmina Watson, of Watson Immigration Law, said. \nCNNMoney (New York)   18, 2017: 6:39 PM

"Published: Apr 18, 2017 2:58 p.m. ET Share \nThe sport is boring viewers and refusing to change its ways \nBy Jason Notte Columnist A previous version of this column misidentified golfer Lexi Thompson on two occasions. The column has been corrected. Reuters Sergio Garcia of Spain won the 81st Masters on April 9. \nWe shouldn\u2019t be saying this a few days after the Masters, but we will anyway: Golf isn\u2019t helping itself. \nIt isn\u2019t the Professional Golfers\u2019 Association\u2019s fault that world No. 1 Dustin Johnson fell down some stairs and couldn\u2019t play in the biggest major tournament in the U.S., but it certainly wasn\u2019t doing much to help ratings, which faltered in the early rounds . Even when players are healthy and the rounds are as dramatic as they were at the end of last year\u2019s tournament, Masters ratings still manage to slip . Golf\u2019s answer is to change absolutely nothing and trudge onward. \nIt is very much the Ladies Professional Golf Association\u2019s fault that it allowed a tattletale television viewer to call in and add four strokes to Lexi Thompson\u2019s total at the ANA Inspiration tournament after she spotted a ball less than an inch from its original position. Those strokes cost Thompson the tournament and not only incurred the wrath of Tiger Woods but of just about every golfer at Augusta National in the first weekend of April. \nThough both the United States Golf Association and Britain\u2019s Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews have agreed to sweeping rules changes that would eliminate such pedantic penalties by 2019, they\u2019re more than happy to let Thompson\u2019s loss stand and continue their draconian approach to the game for another year and a half. \nIn the United States, golf doesn\u2019t have the luxury of time. In 2014, Nielsen noted that 63% of the PGA\u2019s television audience was over the age of 55. Some 87% of that audience was white, while only 12% was younger than 35. By comparison, only 25% of the National Basketball Association\u2019s audience is 55 or older, 47% is younger than 35, and 57% is nonwhite. \nThe LPGA\u2019s key demographic isn\u2019t all that different from that of its male counterparts. Both the PGA and LPGA have a viewership that\u2019s about 63% male. Roughly 64% of the LPGA\u2019s audience is 30 or older, and 84% is white. \nGolf\u2019s core audience is literally dying, and it\u2019s affecting golf far beyond its television broadcasts. After the U.S. built golf courses at a rate of roughly 400 a year during the 1980s and 1990s, it\u2019s retreated from a peak of 16,000 courses. Though the U.S. still accounts for more than 40% of the world\u2019s golf courses, according to the National Golf Foundation (NGF), the country has lost nearly 800 courses in the past decade. Some have been outright abandoned for their real estate value. \nOf course, it would help if anybody actually wanted to play the game. The NGF says the number of U.S. players dropped from an all-time high of 30 million in 2005 to 24.1 million in 2015. That\u2019s below even the pre-Tiger Woods high of 24.7 in 1995. Though optimists note that the average number of rounds being played per player hasn\u2019t dropped, the U.S. golf industry has been largely unable to woo beginners into playing more than a few rounds before dropping the sport entirely. \nNike NKE, -0.45% has stopped producing golf equipment, Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods DKS, +1.02% is cutting sales-floor space dedicated to the sport and business is moving off the golf course. Even worse, the number of people ages 18 to 30 playing the sport is down 35% in the past decade . It\u2019s an expensive sport that takes more than three hours to play, and instead of making it more attractive to newcomers, designers have been hell-bent on making courses as difficult as possible . \nListen, we understand this is an era of niches and that golf doesn\u2019t have to try to be all things to all people. But golf isn\u2019t e-sports. It isn\u2019t soccer. It isn\u2019t the NBA. It\u2019s a sport whose niche is narrowing and whose player base is dwindling. It also sits on acres of real estate that have become increasingly valuable as expanding cities consider the redevelopment of golf courses into industrial sites , agricultural areas , housing , park land and mixed-use developments . \nThere is no second coming of Tiger Woods . There is no burgeoning generation of children longing to play a four-hour game filled with nitpicky, self-policing rules. There is no city in the U.S. willing to trade density and tax ratables for divots and rough. If golf has little to offer this country but televised shots of manicured greens and galleries and living rooms of cranky, aging diehards, then it should prepare to take a seat beside horse racing among U.S. sports antiques. \nJason Notte is a freelance writer based in Portland, Ore.

He opened his keynote with jokes about the Fast and the Furious. He spoke briefly about building community before addressing the Cleveland murder. \nOn Sunday, a Cleveland man posted a video to Facebook ( FB , Tech30 ) of him shooting and killing Godwin., a 74-year-old grandfather who was on his way home from an Easter meal with family. \nJust an hour before the conference kicked off, news broke that the murder suspect had been found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. \nThe murder video stayed up for more than two hours on Sunday before it was removed by Facebook, according to a timeline later shared by the company. The delay reignited criticism over Facebook's handling of offensive content. \n\"We know we need to do better,\" Justin Osofsky, VP of global operations at Facebook, wrote in a post Monday. \nRelated: Facebook on murder video: 'We know we need to do better' \nIt's just the latest in a growing list of disturbing videos of murder, suicide , torture and beheading published on Facebook, however briefly, either through live broadcasts or video uploads. \nA source close to Facebook says it has \"thousands\" of people reviewing content around the world. Once a piece of content is reported by users as inappropriate, it is typically reviewed \"within 24 hours.\" \nBut some have criticized Facebook for making users its first line of defense. \n\"It's actually the users who are exposed to something that they find disturbing, and then they start that process of review,\" says Sarah T. Roberts, an assistant professor at UCLA who studies online content moderation. \nIn the case of the most recent murder video, nearly two hours passed before users reported it on Facebook, according to the company. Facebook disabled the account behind the video 23 minutes after that. \nIn a lengthy manifesto about the future of Facebook published in February, Zuckerberg acknowledged \"terribly tragic events -- like suicides, some live streamed -- that perhaps could have been prevented if someone had realized what was happening and reported them sooner.\" \nZuckerberg said Facebook is developing artificial intelligence to better flag content on the site. This system \"already generates about one-third of all reports to the team that reviews content,\" according to Zuckerberg's post. \nCNNMoney (New York)   18, 2017: 1:19 PM ET", "title": "F8: Mark Zuckerberg briefly mentions Facebook murder video 18,", "uuid": "cfba9174006244f02221f8a58b4f7cdeb78e7a94", "thread": {"title": "F8: Mark Zuckerberg briefly mentions Facebook murder video 18,", "domain_rank": 81, "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "participants_count": 1, "replies_count": 0, "site": "cnn.com", "published": "2017-04-18T21:19:00.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGA3.NJT5K_1aVplQZ0eI9tLq.MZsZf3TNgRdfVVVXqZlwsDrcVgT.FTvyf0V5vk9_hGT010BqFi6A0lJ_OCqtDw--", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_technology.rss", "uuid": "cfba9174006244f02221f8a58b4f7cdeb78e7a94", "performance_score": 8, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 834, "comments": 0, "shares": 834}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 9}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/150109051849-facebook-zuckerberg-780x439.jpg", "title_full": "F8: Mark Zuckerberg briefly mentions Facebook murder video - Apr. 18, 2017", "section_title": "Technology news - CNNMoney.com", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "san jose", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "brad tuttle", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "babysitte", "sentiment": "neutral"}], "organizations": [{"name": "care.com", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-20T21:45:27.000+03:00", "author": "Brad Tuttle", "published": "2017-04-19T23:33:00.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgzxYY8EukyvawgPa1.Y5vQ6jIo1HAePgnVOxz1.gE9O7lUrY8YvxPntBP3WVN1xXAsJcMcXGuyGfzE3c6F85mwH", "text": "This Is How Much You Should Be Paying Your Babysitter Now Brad Tuttle Tweet Share The 2017 Babysitter Survey from Care.com shows babysitters earn nearly $14 an hour, on average, nationally.

It\u2019s possible: The average sitter gets paid nearly twice the federal minimum hourly wage, according to a new survey released this week by Care.com . The 2017 Babysitter Survey , which is based on the polling of 800 parents around the country in February, shows that the average hourly rate for babysitters nationally is $13.97. That\u2019s nearly double the federal minimum wage ($7.25), and it\u2019s up 26% from the average in 2011 ($11.11 per hour). An overwhelming share of parents (83%) say that babysitters should indeed make above the minimum wage. The likelihood that parents tip their sitters on top of the hourly rate is on the rise as well: 34% said they tip, compared to 26% in 2015.

What\u2019s more, people in the Northeast and Midwest most often give cash, while those in the South and the West are more likely to give an actual gift from the wedding registry.\nBut the expense of attending a wedding is too much of a financial strain for some: 21% of would-be guests indicate that they have declined a wedding invitation because they felt they couldn\u2019t afford to go, including 27% of women and 16% of men. \u201cInvitations usually go out months before the big day, so start budgeting early,\u201d says Sarah Berger, author of \u201cThe Cashlorette\u201d blog at Bankrate. \u201cHowever, if you simply can\u2019t afford to go, be financially responsible and skip the event.\u201d\nOther studies suggest far more people send their regrets due to the expense: 40% of wedding guests said they skipped a wedding due to its cost, a recent survey by travel website Priceline found. The amount guests spend has dramatically risen since the recession. In 2016, the average cost per guest of attending a wedding hit $703, up from $673 in 2015 and more than double what guests spent in 2012, according to the 2016 American Express Spending & Saving Tracker .\nDon\u2019t miss: How much should I spend on a wedding gift?\nMost people attend three weddings a year on average, the Amex survey found, and millennials planned to spend 27% more than the general population at $893 per wedding. But Elaine Swann, a lifestyle and etiquette expert, said people are putting too much pressure on themselves to buy the perfect gift. \u201cYour presence really is a present,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bride and groom would prefer to share the day with you than receive a gift if it comes down to that.\u201d\nThere\u2019s no right or wrong answer to giving cash or gifts, she added. \u201cYou\u2019ll find cash given in areas where individuals are more affluent and in areas where people tend to follow more traditional aspects of gift giving you\u2019ll find physical gifts,\u201d Swann said. And there\u2019s no reason to spend hundreds of dollars, she added. Swann recommends starting at around $50 for wedding gifts, saying that the gifts of more than $200 mentioned in the study are over the top for most couples.\nThere are a number of simple ways to keep the cost of wedding gifts down, said Courtney Jespersen, retail expert at personal-finance website Nerdwallet. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be bound to the registry \u2014 you can buy a gift they have listed at another store after comparing prices and searching for coupons,\u201d she said. And you can shop for a summer wedding in the sales, as long as you plan far enough in advance and avoid impulse purchases , Jespersen added.\nMore from MarketWatch The Fight Against ISIS: Where Things Stand Former NFL player Aaron Hernandez kills himself in prison Big, Luxury SUVs Make a Comeback", "title": "This is why people are declining your wedding invitations - MarketWatch", "uuid": "a3d4c8376b1ca9180f08a5b1c8228815935c67b1", "thread": {"title": "This is why people are declining your wedding invitations - MarketWatch", "domain_rank": 900, "site_full": "www.marketwatch.com", "participants_count": 1, "replies_count": 0, "site": "marketwatch.com", "published": "2017-04-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.87ohzHzuPF_yWpWy60ceBMY5195Osq5iLqBh8LPK7z7iW9z27guRXH_YlcwEeMEk_w.YbuH0Ct29c3pFwRGZ44ee7VujILJf_28K9MAoch9wKlX6qHA2sVAZvjRbtwSA-", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "http://www.marketwatch.com/topics/companies/target-corp?prop=location&propval=china", "uuid": "a3d4c8376b1ca9180f08a5b1c8228815935c67b1", "performance_score": 8, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 813, "comments": 0, "shares": 813}, "linkedin": {"shares": 27}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s.marketwatch.com/public/resources/MWimages/MW-ER523_gradua_ZG_20160714124809.jpg", "title_full": "This is why people are declining your wedding invitations - MarketWatch", "section_title": "Target Corp. - MarketWatch.com Topics", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": []}, "crawled": "2017-04-19T13:27:37.000+03:00", "author": "Octavio Blanco", "published": "2017-04-19T13:27:37.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGlfE6_B6LKpDi1uE_saDx.Buzr8itazQEZWLEiKnjrXJxDFpq_kOYp0e1NQhX4usLlHi7HQ66kpDooyk1iIp_Ow--", "text": "Every tax season, millions of undocumented immigrants file their taxes with the federal government -- even though they could easily get away without doing so. Out of the nearly 11.1 million undocumented immigrants estimated to be living in the U.S., Pew Research projected that there were about 8 million in the workforce in 2014. \nNearly half, or 3.4 million, of those workers paid Social Security taxes, according to 2014 estimates from the Social Security administration. And while the agency doesn't have a figure for how much this group paid in taxes that year, it said that unauthorized immigrant workers and their employers contributed $13 billion in payroll taxes in 2010, its most current estimate. \nRelated: America's undocumented immigrant workforce has stopped growing \nBut why would millions of undocumented immigrants file their tax returns if they could easily fly under the radar? \n\"First of all, it's the law,\" said Jose Maga\u00f1a-Salgado, a policy attorney at the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. \"And these undocumented immigrants are trying to abide by the law and are fulfilling their civic and financial responsibilities.\" \nShould they ever go before an immigration judge, it will also help their case. \nMaga\u00f1a-Salgado said judges tend to look more favorably upon immigrants who have a history of filing and paying their taxes. \"Filing taxes helps to build a record of existence here in the United States if they are facing permanent deportation hearings,\" he said. \nMany undocumented immigrants are also seeking to get a refund. \n\"Whether someone is documented or not, it doesn't mean that they shouldn't avail themselves to the tax laws of the U.S.,\" Maga\u00f1a-Salgado said. \"And if they are due a refund, it's because they paid more than their income required.\" \nIn order to file for a federal tax return, undocumented immigrants need to apply for an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) from the Internal Revenue Service. \nThe IRS issues these numbers to individuals who must file taxes, but don't possess or aren't eligible for a Social Security number. ITINs are issued to people regardless of their immigration status. An ITIN doesn't give a person legal work authorization and doesn't provide eligibility for Social Security benefits, according to the IRS website . \nRelated: How much it costs ICE to deport an undocumented immigrant \nBut an ITIN will help an undocumented immigrant get a refund if they are owed one, no questions asked, said Steve Choi, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition. \"Same as they pay taxes if they owe, no questions asked,\" he said. \nFor the most part, undocumented immigrants don't need to fear that their tax information will be shared with federal immigration enforcement agencies. \nAccording to the National Immigration Law Center, the IRS is generally prohibited from disclosing taxpayer information, even to other federal agencies. \nHowever, certain exceptions apply. \nFor example, the IRS is required to disclose taxpayer information to certain U.S. Treasury Department employees when they request it for tax administration purposes or to other federal agencies if it's needed for a criminal investigation and a federal court has issued an order that it be provided, NILC said on it's website . \nCNNMoney (New York)   19, 2017: 6:06 AM ET", "title": "Why undocumented immigrants pay taxes - Apr. 19, 2017", "uuid": "ef564eb2580ea5fbc5fbf15dcca21cf569cb83de", "thread": {"title": "Why undocumented immigrants pay taxes - Apr. 19, 2017", "domain_rank": 81, "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "site": "cnn.com", "published": "2017-04-19T13:27:37.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGlfE6_B6LKpDi1uE_saDx.Buzr8itazQEZWLEiKnjrXJxDFpq_kOYp0e1NQhX4usLlHi7HQ66kpDooyk1iIp_Ow--", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "", "uuid": "ef564eb2580ea5fbc5fbf15dcca21cf569cb83de", "performance_score": 8, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 811, "comments": 0, "shares": 811}, "linkedin": {"shares": 13}, "gplus": {"shares": 9}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.234, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/131218140518-1040-tax-form-780x439.jpg", "title_full": "Why undocumented immigrants pay taxes - Apr. 19, 2017", "section_title": "", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wisconsin", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "trump", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "heather long", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "edward jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kate warne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "george w. bush", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wile e. coyote", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sam bullard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bullard", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "warne", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glenn hubbard", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "congress", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "university of michigan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "commerce department", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "macroeconomic advisers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "columbia business school", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "wells fargo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "atlanta federal reserve", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "et watch trump", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-19T01:04:35.000+03:00", "author": "Heather Long", "published": "2017-04-18T09:06:00.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGA3.NJT5K_1Z_C4Q1fvjoTTRdFLJK_C1OM44wnfkvpYz7dxRXhmMW1g.xJ7VsgSGzWeHaW.C1oDn0p4x_BiKUB9XFSOTbYUCtoiE32OdfsAQ-", "text": "Watch Trump's stunning U-turns on key issues President Trump keeps pushing \" Buy American .\" He's planning to tout it again at a stop in Wisconsin on Tuesday. But the alarming reality is Americans aren't spending much money on anything right now, regardless of where it's made. \nRetail sales declined in February and March from the prior month, according the Commerce Department. Shoppers haven't been this stingy since early 2015, and it's likely to hurt the economy. \nThe U.S. is on track for very sluggish 0.5% growth in the first three months this year, according to the latest estimates from Macroeconomic Advisers and the Atlanta Federal Reserve. That falls massively short of the 4% growth that Trump has promised. \nTrump loves to plug how Americans' confidence in the economy has skyrocketed since he won the election. He's right. Consumers , businesses (big and small ) and investors are all feeling a lot more optimistic, according to various surveys. \nBut all that enthusiasm isn't translating into more shopping, which drives the U.S. economy. About 70% of the American economy comes from people buying stuff. \nKate Warne, a long-time investment strategist at Edward Jones, calls this the era of \"skeptical optimism.\" \n\"People are more optimistic, but they're skeptically optimistic,\" Warne told CNNMoney. \"I don't think they are confident yet that things will change as much as they would like them too.\" \nRelated: What we'd learn if Trump released his tax returns \nAmericans are in 'wait and see' mode \nIn some ways, this is playing out a lot like Election 2016 where the polls said one thing and people ended up doing something else on Election Day. \nIn this case, the \"soft data,\" based on phone calls with people and business leaders, shows a lot of optimism. But the \"hard data\" on actual consumer and business spending is showing a lot of hesitation. \nEven the stock market, which surged 2,700 points after Trump's election and inauguration, has fallen 2% (about 500 points) in the past month. Investors have run back to \"safe haven\" assets like U.S. government bonds and gold. \nThe common explanation is that everyone from Wall Street to Main Street is in \"wait and see\" mode. A big wake up call was the failure of the health care bill in March . The Trump agenda is going to take a while to implement, and some of it might have to tweaked a lot. \n\"We decided to wait until policy initiatives became clearer before altering our trend economic forecast,\" wrote Sam Bullard, senior economist at Wells Fargo in a recent note to clients. There have been a lot of cautious notes like Bullard's coming out lately from Wall Street experts. \nRelated: Trump is dialing back his economic promises. Bigly \nRepublicans are a lot more optimistic than Democrats \nAnother twist is that Republicans are a lot more optimistic than Democrats. The University of Michigan does one of the most widely watched surveys of consumer confidence. Researchers there have discovered an \" unprecedented \" partisan divide in confidence since Trump was elected. \nOverall, the University of Michigan index of consumer confidence has jumped from 87 in October to 98 today. But that headline figure masks a wild division. Democrats believe \"a deep recession\" is coming under Trump (their confidence index is a mere 55), while Republicans expected a \"new era of robust economic growth\" (their index level is a sky-high 122). Independents are in between, as you might expect. \nIf half the country thinks recession is near, that might explain why retail sales are slowing, or even showing some signs of decline. \nRelated: Americans have become lazy and it's hurting the economy \nTrump's best hope: A spring bounce \nPerhaps the best hope for Trump is that spring sunshine drives people to shop again. It's happened before. In fact, it's happened frequently in recent years where Americans stay home during the winter and then the economy really picks up in the spring and summer. \nMacroeconomic Advisers, for instance, is predicting 3.6% growth for the second quarter (April through June). \nBut that won't be enough for Trump to show he's delivering a better economy than Obama did. \n\"We expect growth to be slightly stronger in 2017 versus 2016. It's a modest increase, nothing dramatic,\" Warne of Edward Jones says. \nTrump and Congress will have to deliver on taxes while avoiding any missteps on trade or foreign policy. Even then, the optimism may not materialize into as big of a boost as some want. \nAs Glenn Hubbard, dean of Columbia Business School and the former top economist for President George W. Bush, put it last month: \"Animal spirits will only take you so far. Then you're like Wile E. Coyote in the cartoon. You realize there's nothing beneath your feet, and it's a long way down.\" \nCNNMoney (New York)   18, 2017: 1:06 PM ET", "title": "Trump's new problem: Americans aren't shopping - Apr. 18, 2017", "uuid": "30e28d4a7f226c963e584691fa5316c5d227ff54", "thread": {"title": "Trump's new problem: Americans aren't shopping - Apr. 18, 2017", "domain_rank": 81, "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "site": "cnn.com", "published": "2017-04-18T09:06:00.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGA3.NJT5K_1Z_C4Q1fvjoTTRdFLJK_C1OM44wnfkvpYz7dxRXhmMW1g.xJ7VsgSGzWeHaW.C1oDn0p4x_BiKUB9XFSOTbYUCtoiE32OdfsAQ-", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "", "uuid": "30e28d4a7f226c963e584691fa5316c5d227ff54", "performance_score": 7, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 792, "comments": 0, "shares": 792}, "linkedin": {"shares": 6}, "gplus": {"shares": 16}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.112, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170413082807-trump-dollar-780x439.jpg", "title_full": "Trump's new problem: Americans aren't shopping - Apr. 18, 2017", "section_title": "", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dublin", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "portugal", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "spain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greece", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "netherlands", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "madrid", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ireland", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "italy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "france", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "germany", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "ivana kottasova @ivanakottas", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "keith redmond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "young", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "-- elinda labropoulou", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "redmond", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bagnai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "panagiotopoulos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "sergi cutillas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brousseau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cutillas", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "vincent brousseau", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "francisco franco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fotis panagiotopoulos", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "marine le pen", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alberto bagnai", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maud le rest", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "le pen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "european central bank", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ecb", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "upr", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "athens port authority", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-19T12:37:00.000+03:00", "author": "Ivana Kottasova", "published": "2017-04-19T12:37:00.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGlfE6_B6LKpDi1uE_saDx.NcFuswheCOY86_NLQXhSSnpIYj5nstj16kq6JqoPM9k2Q2lAd.KeY4-", "text": "The rise and fall of the euro Sergi Cutillas was thrilled when Spain joined the euro. Now he wants out. \"The eurozone has failed. It was a bad experiment,\" he said. \"It was wishful thinking.\" \nThe 34-year-old economist wants Spain to abandon the euro. He's far from alone: 25% of the people who use the common currency want to ditch it, according to the latest European Union poll. \nThe threat to the euro is most acute in France, where people will vote Sunday in the first round of a presidential election that features Marine Le Pen. The far right politician, who wants to take France out of the currency union , is expected to advance to a runoff vote against one other candidate on May 7. \nThe euro, the currency of 19 EU countries, is the most visible symbol of the region's long experiment with economic integration since the end of World War II. \nBut it's now under threat from politicians on both the left and right who want to bring the lira, drachma, peseta and French franc out of retirement. \nHere's why some Europeans want to kill the euro: \n'Europe is not a nation' \n\nFor Alberto Bagnai, the case against the currency boils down to this: European countries are not the same, and so they shouldn't use the same currency. \n\"The basic point is that you cannot have a federal state among citizens from countries with such a different cultural past,\" said the Italian academic. \"Without a European state, you cannot have European money.\" \nSome European countries are richer, some are poorer, like American states. But unlike the U.S., the eurozone does not have a central government to decide on spending, tax and budget policies. \n\"The U.S. is a nation, there is a sense of common identity,\" he said. \nThat's not true in Europe, where there's little prospect of political unity because wealthier nations such as Germany would end up transferring money permanently to the less fortunate. \n\"Germany does not want this,\" said Bagnai. \"We should stop telling fairy tales.\" \n'Optical illusion' \nSuch deep divisions were not always so apparent. \nThe interest rates that Spain, Greece and Italy needed to pay creditors plummeted after they joined the euro -- putting them on a par with Germany. \n\"Investors looked at nominal interest rates and thought the Greeks have become German,\" said Bagnai. \"It was kind of an optical illusion.\" \nThen the financial crisis hit, and cracks in the monetary union began to show. \n\nIn Spain, policymakers weren't able to make the euro cheaper to counter the collapse of a property bubble and debt crisis. \nInstead, Madrid was forced to reduce spending and implement an austerity program -- and that hit living standards. \n\"The 20% unemployment we now have in Spain is a direct result of the euro,\" said the economist Cutillas. \nRelated: Europe's lost generation: Young, educated and unemployed \n\nCutillas said that many people in Spain, which endured decades of violent dictatorship under Francisco Franco, support the euro because it's associated with progress, modernity and peace. That isn't enough for the economist. \n\"It's nice to be able to travel around easily and have easy means of payment, but these advantages shouldn't cover what's happening with the euro,\" he said. \n\nA Greek tragedy \nGreece is a prime example of the division between wealthy northern European countries and weaker economies on the continent's periphery. \nFacing a debt crisis of its own, Athens agreed to drastic austerity programs in exchange for repeated bailouts. Salaries, pensions and government spending have all been cut dramatically. \nFotis Panagiotopoulos, a dock worker at the Athens Port Authority, experienced the consequences first hand. \nHis salary has dropped 50% since the beginning of the Greek crisis in 2010. His wife can't find a stable job. \n\"What we are experiencing in Greece is slow death,\" he said. \"There is no way out unless we break free from this debt cycle.\" \nPanagiotopoulos wants Greece to ditch the euro and start over. \n\"We just want to make sure that we, and our children, can have a decent future,\" he said. \"With the euro, I don't see how this is possible.\" \n\nIreland's 'euro-bubble' \nRemember the Celtic Tiger? Ireland boomed in the euro's early years, growing on average 6.5% a year between 1999 and 2007. \nKeith Redmond, a dentist and local politician in Dublin, looks back on those days with fear. \n\"It wasn't a boom. It was a bubble ... a euro-currency bubble,\" he said. \nRedmond argues that without control over its interest rates, Ireland wasn't able to cool the bubble. \nWhen it burst, it brought the Irish banking system to the brink of collapse. Ireland was forced to slash spending. \nIreland has turned the corner and its economy is growing again. But for Redmond, the euro remains a problem. \n\"The fundamental flaw is still there ... this can all happen again. We have no flexibility in our monetary system to deal with a shock,\" he said. \n\nFrench nationalism \nVincent Brousseau is a French economist. But for him, the trouble with the euro is not about the economics. \nInstead, he sees the common currency as a threat to France's national sovereignty. \n\"It's not French,\" he said of the currency. \"It doesn't matter whether it's overvalued or undervalued... this is about making our own decisions.\" \nHe's had a major change of heart. Brousseau worked for the European Central Bank until a few years ago. \n\"When I started at the ECB, I believed there could be one Europe, I was a convinced European,\" he said. \nBut he gradually changed his opinion over the 15 years he spent at the central bank that sets a common interest rate for all 19 eurozone countries. \n\"I realized that transferring sovereignty from France to the European superstate is not good for the country,\" said Brousseau, who now oversees economic and monetary policy at French political party UPR. \nRelated: The euro cannot survive unless Europe changes \nWhat's next \nOpponents of the euro disagree on what should happen next. \nRedmond would like to see the currency split into two. The current euro would be used by Germany, Netherlands and other economically stronger countries. A second, weaker euro, would be introduced for Portugal, Italy, Ireland, Greece and Spain. \nBrousseau wants France to completely drop the euro and bring back the franc. He's not a fan of the the compromises proposed by far right presidential candidate Marine Le Pen, who wants to drop the euro, but use a new pan-European currency in parallel to the franc. \nIn Italy, Bagnai thinks the end of the euro is an inevitability. \n\"We know that the project could last for a decade, perhaps, but it's going to end. And the sooner it ends the better.\" \n-- Elinda Labropoulou and Maud Le Rest contributed reporting. \nCNNMoney (London)   19, 2017: 5:32 AM ET", "title": "They want to kill the euro - Apr. 19, 2017", "uuid": "40546d3f290726d1e64aed64bfa569edaf3ea208", "thread": {"title": "They want to kill the euro - Apr. 19, 2017", "domain_rank": 81, "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "site": "cnn.com", "published": "2017-04-19T12:37:00.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGlfE6_B6LKpDi1uE_saDx.NcFuswheCOY86_NLQXhSSnpIYj5nstj16kq6JqoPM9k2Q2lAd.KeY4-", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "", "uuid": "40546d3f290726d1e64aed64bfa569edaf3ea208", "performance_score": 7, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 790, "comments": 0, "shares": 790}, "linkedin": {"shares": 31}, "gplus": {"shares": 7}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.389, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170418101249-eurozone-end-780x439.jpg", "title_full": "They want to kill the euro - Apr. 19, 2017", "section_title": "", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "venezuela", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "argentina", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "us", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "latin america", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "patrick gillespie @cnnmoney apri", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "tareck el aissami", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "leopoldo lopez", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "maduro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mauricio macri", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nicolas maduro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "henrique capriles", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "imf", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "supreme court", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "organization of american states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "national assembly", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-19T00:16:42.000+03:00", "author": "", "published": "2017-04-19T00:16:42.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGA3.NJT5K_1Z_C4Q1fvjoTf5S8q2UJ0ArEOKSwLyFbyzWKpfRZgpsbQxDS6M5FCIw_.UAEivd.37z4k6TxERZeQ--", "text": "Why Venezuelans are protesting Venezuela is diving deeper into crisis as its citizens continue massive protests against President Nicolas Maduro and major companies are pulling out of the country. On Wednesday, three people were killed in violent anti-government protests across the country. \nLater that day, the government also seized General Motors' plant in Venezuela. The company immediately shut down its operations there. Other major corporations, like Pepsi ( PEP ) and Delta ( DAL ) , had already either written off or dramatically cut down operations in recent years. \nThe country's malaise of crises stem from the socialist regime that's largely created an economic crisis. \nOn Tuesday, The IMF didn't sugarcoat its updated economic outlook for Venezuela. \n\"Venezuela remains mired in a deep economic crisis,\" IMF authors wrote in its World Economic Outlook . \nUnemployment is set to surpass 25% this year, possibly on its way to 28% next year. It was at 7.4% in 2015. \nVenezuela's economy shrank a massive 18% last year -- its third year of recession and it's expected to be in the red this year, and next too. \nRelated: Venezuela's brain drain: We don't want to go back \nThe IMF's prediction for inflation in Venezuela is pretty bad, but better than previous expectations: It's expected to skyrocket 720% this year -- somehow only half of the previous forecast. But if Venezuela stays on its current path, the IMF predicts inflation will rise over 2000% in 2018. \nThat's only the tip of the iceberg. \nProtesters have taken to the streets in recent weeks after Maduro's administration barred opposition leader Henrique Capriles from holding any political office for the next 15 years . More protests are planned in the coming days. \nVenezuelans have struggled for years with food and medical shortages , and -- more recently -- skyrocketing prices on all types of goods, as hyperinflation wipes out salaries and the value of the currency, the bolivar. \nThey have demanded Maduro step down as any signs of democracy have washed away. His loyalist-backed Supreme Court tried to strip the opposition-led National Assembly of its powers, but quickly reversed course after severe public outcry. The Supreme Court has blocked all reforms from opposition lawmakers. \nRelated: Venezuela is down to its last $10 billion \nMaduro is facing pressure from overseas too. \nPresident Trump tweeted in February that Maduro should release his biggest adversary from prison, Leopoldo Lopez, who has been in jail since 2014. The US has also slapped sanctions on Maduro's vice president, Tareck El Aissami, for alleged drug trafficking. \nThe Organization of American States, which includes every government in the western hemisphere, demanded in March that Venezuela hold democratic elections or face suspension from the group. \nMaduro's peers in Latin America -- long silent on the country's crises -- are starting to speak out too. \n\"They are not fulfilling what we consider human rights,\" Argentina's President, Mauricio Macri, told CNN earlier in April. \"I am really worried about what is going on.\" \nCNNMoney (New York)   18, 2017: 11:58 AM ET", "title": "Venezuela spirals into 'deep economic crisis'", "uuid": "363513cf36707537a1661639defb6c47e2ee597f", "thread": {"title": "Venezuela spirals into 'deep economic crisis'", "domain_rank": 81, "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "site": "cnn.com", "published": "2017-04-19T00:16:42.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGA3.NJT5K_1Z_C4Q1fvjoTf5S8q2UJ0ArEOKSwLyFbyzWKpfRZgpsbQxDS6M5FCIw_.UAEivd.37z4k6TxERZeQ--", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "http://www.rssmicro.com/rss.web?q=Venezuela", "uuid": "363513cf36707537a1661639defb6c47e2ee597f", "performance_score": 7, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 788, "comments": 0, "shares": 788}, "linkedin": {"shares": 9}, "gplus": {"shares": 7}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170308145206-venezuela-crisis-780x439.jpg", "title_full": "Venezuela spirals into 'deep economic crisis'", "section_title": "Venezuela", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": ["http://www.meatlessmonday.com/", "http://markbittman.com/i-answer-frequently-asked-questions-about-vb6/", "https://smartasset.com/snippet.js"], "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "hampton creek", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "north korea", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "marketwatch", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "paul shapiro", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oscar mayer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brian kateman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "p.f. chang", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hormel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mark bittman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "oscar munoz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tofurky", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "boca burgers", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kraft khc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "johnny rockets", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kellogg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "american institute for cancer research", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "penguin random house llc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morningstar farms", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "nasdaq", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "walmart wmt", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reducetarian foundation inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hormel hrl", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cmg", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "burger king", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-19T12:08:53.000+03:00", "author": "Paul Shapiro", "published": "2017-04-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.87ohzHzuPF_yWpWy60ceBMY5195Osq5gpSToRH6pl00WiBy63E0iEjrKCfwnutNrGCwKEzIs5Oy4qn8sUpVH9_Wi2_yGgANHDANDaPUwFVsd7Xyy8ObUN", "text": "Many of us must save up to be able to take a holiday. We deprive ourselves in the short term, thinking about all the fun ways we\u2019ll be able to spend that hard-earned cash in the future. Yet there\u2019s one kind of holiday that can help break up the monotony of daily life while also saving us money. Taking occasional holidays from meat will actually save us money.\nMany Americans across the country are already doing just that. We Americans now eat about 10% less meat per capita than we did in 2007. It seems that dietary concepts like the three R\u2019s (\u201creducing\u201d or \u201creplacing\u201d consumption of animal products while \u201crefining\u201d our diets) may finally be here to stay.\nSome of this reduction may come from following popular movements like Meatless Mondays or Mark Bittman\u2019s Vegan Before 6 program . But, of course, there are many reasons why so many of us are taking breaks from a meat-heavy diet. Wanting to look and feel better, to protect animals, and to help save the planet are just a few motives people commonly offer. But an additional benefit of keeping animals off our plates more often is that it helps us keep more money in our wallets.\nMeat, eggs, and dairy are costly and they\u2019re getting even more expensive. It\u2019s no secret that vegetarian foods are far less resource-intensive than the breeding and slaughtering of animals. That\u2019s one reason that\u2014even with distorting federal handouts to the meat industry\u2014meat-free options are often so much more affordable. For example, it\u2019s always cheaper to opt for Chipotle\u2019s CMG, -0.29% bean and rice burritos\u2014or its new chili-rubbed tofu sofritas\u2014than the chain\u2019s meat options. Burger King\u2019s veggie burger will leave more bling in your bank account than a Whopper. And every single vegetarian entr\u00e9e at P.F. Chang\u2019s is cheaper than every meat-based entr\u00e9e the popular restaurant offers.\nHow your mind can make you fat (1:48) Medical costs related to obesity are estimated at $147 billion per year. But according to recent research, the answer to the obesity epidemic might in fact have more to do with our brains than with our bodies.\nOf course, while saving money is a compelling reason to eat a little bit lower on the food chain, the more affordable options are also generally the ones that are better for us as well as the planet. Prestigious public health organizations agree. As the American Institute for Cancer Research noted recently, \u201cThe research shows one thing very clearly: we all need to eat more plants and less meat.\u201d\nNow that Americans are starting to take occasional holidays from meat, even factory farm interests are beginning to pay attention. You know our diets are shifting for the better when companies like Walmart WMT, +0.54% start encouraging a reduction in meat consumption, and local Dollar Tree DLTR, +0.78% stores sell Hampton Creek\u2019s egg-free, plant-based mayo\u2014a product that once might have been consigned solely to health-food stores. In fact, if you don\u2019t happen to read industry magazine Meat + Poultry, you may have missed its recent editorial asking meat producers, \u201cwhy doesn\u2019t the industry make meat analogs?\u201d The writer notes that \u201cmeat analogs are evolving and tasting better than ever\u201d and Quote: s a meat scientist talking about companies like Tofurky, counseling, \u201cDon\u2019t fight them, join them.\u201d\nIndeed, that\u2019s already what\u2019s happening. Food giant Kraft KHC, +1.00% may own Oscar Mayer, but it also owns Boca Burgers. Kellogg\u2019s K, +0.93% owns MorningStar Farms. Meat-centric diner chains like Johnny Rockets and Friendly\u2019s are now offering vegan burgers. Even Burger King\u2014the king of burgers\u2014is promoting Meatless Mondays.\nThe world is indeed shifting, and for the better. Pork giant Hormel HRL, +0.84% recently bought another type of plant protein product: Skippy peanut butter. One benefit of this acquisition \u2014 according to another meat industry trade publication, Meatingplace \u2014 is that \u201cactivists are not using hidden cameras to scope out peanut abuse by Hormel\u2019s suppliers.\u201d Certainly not.\nSo many Americans are cutting down on meat consumption in fact that Nasdaq published a post looking at how \u201cthe death of meat\u201d could impact your stock portfolio. The article concluded that investors should \u201cthink twice about holding long positions in meat industry stocks or exchange-traded securities\u201d because \u201cmeat consumption has been steadily declining, which could play out into a huge profit potential.\u201d\nIt\u2019s always a good time to start new positive habits. But with meat prices projected to keep rising, there\u2019s never been a better time to start. Each time we sit down to eat, our choices can help make the world a better place. It\u2019s striking and exciting that something as simple as opting for hearty three-bean chili or pasta primavera instead of a drumstick or sausage could have such an impact.\nHolidays from meat are a win for bodies, which will likely be lighter\u2014literally. They\u2019re a win for our planet, since the burden we place on it will be lighter. And they\u2019re a win for animals, which should make our consciences lighter. In fact, the only thing that won\u2019t be lighter will be our wallets. Now that\u2019s the kind of break we could all use more often.\nExcerpted from \u201cThe Reducetarian Solution: How the Surprisingly Simple Act of Reducing the Amount of Meat in Your Diet Can Transform Your Health and The Planet\u201d, edited by Brian Kateman, essay by Paul Shapiro.

Malaysia Airlines wants to keep a closer eye on its planes. \nMore than three years after its flight MH370 vanished with 239 people aboard, the airline has become the first to sign up for a service that will track its entire fleet with satellites. \nMalaysia Airlines struck a deal with a group of aviation industry firms to monitor the flight paths of its aircraft anywhere in the world, including over \"oceanic, polar and remote regions,\" according to a statement. \nMH370 vanished from radar during a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing and is believed to have crashed in the Indian Ocean. The Boeing 777's disappearance sparked a search of unprecedented scale, prompting a global debate about consistent standards for aircraft tracking. \nRelated: Here's what's been found from MH370 three years after it disappeared \n\"Real-time global aircraft tracking has long been a goal of the aviation community,\" Malaysia Airlines Chief Operating Officer Capt. Izham Ismail said in the statement. \"We are proud to be the first airline to adopt this solution.\" \nThe new partnership -- with Aireon, FlightAware and SITAONAIR -- will ensure the airline has access to space-based tracking data for every minute of a flight's journey. The new system is expected to come online next year. \n\"Malaysia Airlines will know the location, heading, speed and altitude of all aircraft in its fleet, at all times, and be alerted to any exceptions,\" Paul Gibson of SITAONAIR said in the statement. \nMany companies have been jockeying to supply airlines with global tracking systems, including Rockwell Collins ( COL ) and Inmarsat ( IMASF ) . \nThe disappearance of Flight 370 remains one of the world's biggest aviation mysteries and its exact crash site has yet to be located. \nIt's unclear if the new satellite-tracking system would have made a difference, though. \nMH370's transponder, which broadcasts the jet's position and identity to air traffic control, stopped communicating while over the Gulf of Thailand. The Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, also known as ACARS, which transmits small data messages to the airline to a ground network or satellites, also stopped communicating. \nThe extended inquiry has investigated whether the communications were intentionally switched off by someone aboard the aircraft, but no conclusion has been reached. \nRelated: Timeline of MH370 disappearance \nIn the absence of those systems, investigators have had to rely on obscure satellite data to piece together Flight 370's possible path to the southern Indian Ocean. \nIf flights are tracked with updates every minute, it would make it much easier to locate an aircraft if it crashes in a remote part of the world. \nEven with 60 second updates, the precision of a search would be far greater than in the case of MH370. \nThe International Civil Aviation Organization has mandated that an aircraft must transmit its position once every 15 minutes by November 2018. That will drop to once every minute by 2021 if the aircraft is in distress.

One was mounted on a large off-road truck which was identified in an earlier U.N. report as being of Chinese origin.\nIn a 2010 statement sent to China, North Korea's forestry ministry said the trucks were bought to transport timber, according to the U.N. report.\nThe second of the two ICBMs was mounted on a North Korean-branded \"Taekpaeksan\" military truck which used tyres made by China-based Triangle Group, according to photos of the parade seen by Reuters.\nTriangle Group, a major tyre manufacturer headquartered in Weihai, a port city in eastern Shandong province, said it was not aware its tyres had been used in the military parade.\n\"It's possible they were resold from somewhere else,\" an official from Triangle's export department said.\n(Additional reporting by Philip Wen and Christian Shepherd in BEIJING; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)", "title": "China-made truck used in North Korea parade to show submarine-launched missile | Reuters", "uuid": "fa5067b7d434e94bd6064e1b7e6b7ac5ff74193e", "thread": {"title": "China-made truck used in North Korea parade to show submarine-launched missile | Reuters", "domain_rank": 408, "site_full": "www.reuters.com", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "site": "reuters.com", "published": "2017-04-18T11:05:14.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqBzBrDi9DZWSkOscFMYoIEFXKuDfyChLgZosZt3qKFB5WCda3wAd91WzpsO9K1CeR8Y-", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "", "uuid": "fa5067b7d434e94bd6064e1b7e6b7ac5ff74193e", "performance_score": 7, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 772, "comments": 0, "shares": 772}, "linkedin": {"shares": 8}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.289, "main_image": "http://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170418&t=2&i=1180994153&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED3H0AE", "title_full": "China-made truck used in North Korea parade to show submarine-launched missile | Reuters", "section_title": "", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "california", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "selena larson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "hill", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yubikey", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brad hill", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "google", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-19T20:06:09.000+03:00", "author": "", "published": "2017-04-19T20:06:09.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGlfE6_B6LKpC3cnAzrMekkzQJGp8eQah8nW9zCu3.AghZL0Mapm_DdDtfdKbFl9W6_jD6YkQ_PrTecMnfkdApwg--", "text": "Facebook wants to kill the password by Selena Larson @selenalarson April 19, 2017: 10:52 AM ET My hack stole your credit card Someday, passwords will likely be a distant memory. \nFor now, they are necessary -- as well as regularly re-used, and sometimes leaked when hackers access private information. When you forget yours, the process to log back into an account you're locked out of is clunky and not as secure as it could be. \nFacebook ( FB , Tech30 ) wants to change that -- and eventually, to make passwords obsolete. \nFacebook's F8 developer conference on Tuesday brought the launch of the beta version of Delegated Account Recovery, a way for the social network to be the backup security key in case you forget your password on different, non-Facebook services. \nThe idea: If you forget your password on an app or website, it will instead use Facebook to verify you are who you say you are. You will have to prove yourself through exercises like recognizing friends' photos in order to log into your other account. \nRelated: Facebook finally makes a virtual reality world \n\"We want to make sure we can let you use [identifying] information to keep yourself secure, but not have to trade your privacy,\" Facebook security engineer Brad Hill told CNNTech. \"Right now you tell your mother's maiden name to 500 different places and if any one of them gets hacked, then you're vulnerable everywhere.\" \nThink about the last time you forgot your password. The website likely sent a link to your email to reset your password, or texted a code to your mobile phone. You might have answered security questions, like your mother's maiden name or the moniker of your first pet. \nFacebook says its method is more secure. Text messages are unencrypted, and email accounts can be hacked. Further, Facebook's Delegated Account Recovery works even if someone switches their phone number or email address. \nPeople might be skeptical about trusting Facebook with other accounts. The company knows everything about you, and uses your information to advertise to you. And of course, if your Facebook account is hacked, the bad guys can log into your other accounts that way, too. \nBut Hill insisted Facebook has safeguards in place to recognize fraudulent activity, and will alert you if anything seems amiss. If, say, Facebook knows you always log in via your iPhone in California, an attempt from Russia on an Android will be flagged. \nFacebook also limits how many third-party accounts can be recovered at one time, and the company won't know the details of those other accounts. For example, say you use Facebook as your backup code for your bank. Facebook will know you use the bank's services, but it doesn't know anything about your bank account. \nRelated: 4 myths -- and facts -- about online security \nFor now, developers must apply to use the tech. Facebook is open-sourcing this technology so eventually any company can use it -- that is, even if you don't trust Facebook with your identity, you might trust another organization that implements the tool. \nDelegated Account Recovery doesn't replace passwords. But it's a stepping stone in Facebook's efforts to improve and eventually replace the security mechanisms we currently use. You probably already use another one: Facebook Login lets you remember one less password when you sign up for third-party apps. \nGoogle ( GOOG ) , too, is working on products to get rid of the password. Both firms support Yubikey, a physical key you plug into your computer that acts like a password. \nHill said Facebook's account recovery feature will also benefit people just beginning to use the internet, who may have Facebook accounts but not an email or phone number. Instead, he said, people in emerging markets might get accustomed to using social identities as a login authenticator -- not the assortment of letters and numbers that we use as passwords. \n\"Facebook's one of the best pieces of online identity they have, and it can be a great anchor for them to get connected to more services,\" Hill said.

But its state-run oil company -- through a subsidiary -- donated $500,000 to President Trump's inauguration committee on December 22, 2016. \nThat equals what Pepsi ( PEP ) , Verizon ( VZ , Tech30 ) and Walmart ( WMT ) donated combined, according to Federal Election Commission records released Wednesday as deadly protests raged across Venezuela. The donation to Trump's inauguration committee was made by Citgo Petroleum, a subsidiary of Venezuela's state-run oil company, PDVSA. \nThe country's citizens face a litany of crises -- from food and medical shortages to extremely violent crime. \n\"It is an amazing amount of money that could have fed a lot of your population for the month,\" says Russ Dallen, managing partner of Caracas Capital, an investing firm based in Miami. \nRelated: Venezuela seizes GM plant \nVenezuela's state-run oil giant, PDVSA, bought Citgo in the 1980s. When the late President Hugo Chavez took power in 1999, Citgo was a huge money maker for the country. \nVenezuela is home to the world's largest proven oil reserves, which once made PDVSA and Citgo major players in the energy world. During Chavez's presidency, he provided free heating to poor neighborhoods in New York and smaller Caribbean and Central American countries. \nBut with low oil prices and mismanaged resources, the company and country's debts are now piling up as Venezuela runs out of cash. \nFor the rest of this year, Venezuela and PDVSA collectively owe about $6 billion in debt payments. The central bank has only $10 billion in reserves , and much of it isn't even in cash but in gold bars. No wonder, the prospect of Venezuela defaulting on its debt has risen. \nRelated: GM isn't the only company under siege in Venezuela \nBut like the donation to Trump, the country's leader President Nicolas Maduro's spending priorities are being called into question. So far his government has decided to pay down its debts over feeding its people. \nThe donation to the inauguration has also not helped Maduro earn any favors in the White House. Trump met with the wife of Maduro's jailed political opponent Leopoldo Lopez in the White House in February and tweeted that he should be freed. \nRelated: Venezuela protests: What you need to know \nThis past week, the country has been racked by massive protests that were met with force by Venezuelan security forces. At least three people have been killed. \n\"It's very clear he's putting money behind his priorities, but those don't necessarily include the population of the country, in terms of food, medicine, safety,\" says Eric Farnsworth, vice president at the Council of the Americas. \nFood imports to Venezuela dropped 50% last year, according to trade statistics. Venezuelans living in extreme poverty lost an average of 21 pounds of weight last year due to lack of food, according to ENCOVI, a polling firm in Venezuela. \nCNNMoney (New York)   5:01 PM ET", "title": "Crisis-ridden Venezuela gave $500K to Trump inauguration", "uuid": "9f1a1184960a7ccc3907a25de5611ae8c173203a", "thread": {"title": "Crisis-ridden Venezuela gave $500K to Trump inauguration", "domain_rank": 81, "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "participants_count": 1, "replies_count": 0, "site": "cnn.com", "published": "2017-04-21T00:27:08.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGg9eLUWcjPLDDkThCe4YLrIMpKY8.2uC8wLloJsZiaVP.g8Z2Kt6HbIjpEPx.Cb3wifs6VgpdTH_yr7kU0WK4Ug--", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_topstories.rss", "uuid": "9f1a1184960a7ccc3907a25de5611ae8c173203a", "performance_score": 7, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 770, "comments": 0, "shares": 770}, "linkedin": {"shares": 12}, "gplus": {"shares": 9}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170420091506-venezuela-protests-780x439.jpg", "title_full": "Crisis-ridden Venezuela gave $500K to Trump inauguration - Apr. 20, 2017", "section_title": "Business and financial news - CNNMoney.com", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "u.k.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "europe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "brexit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "london", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "theresa may", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "charles riley", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "david cameron", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "naeem aslam", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "eu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "labour party", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "liberal democrats", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "think markets uk", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-18T13:35:33.000+03:00", "author": "Charles Riley", "published": "2017-04-18T13:35:33.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGA3.NJT5K_1a.i5AeH4mdlMirYk6hM.axosyJtig7cYylRdrunaBbfWxeYMQJ7dFETWn5uPAkkZc-", "text": "U.K. Prime Minister May to seek early election The pound charged higher on Tuesday after Prime Minister Theresa May called an early election, a gambit aimed at cementing her position ahead of tricky Brexit negotiations with the European Union.

REUTERS/Remo Casilli 2/2 By Ben Blanchard | BEIJING \nBEIJING China will gather its friends and allies together for its biggest diplomatic event of the year in May, a summit on its New Silk Road plan, with most Asian leaders due to attend but only one from a G7 nation, the Italian prime minister. \nPresident Xi Jinping has championed what China formally calls the \"One Belt, One Road\" or OBOR, initiative to build a new Silk Road linking Asia, Africa and Europe, a landmark program to invest billions of dollars in infrastructure projects including railways, ports and power grids. \nChina has dedicated $40 billion to a Silk Road Fund and the idea was the driving force behind the establishment of the $50 billion China-backed Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. \nForeign Minister Wang Yi announced on Tuesday a list of those attending the conference, including some of China's most reliable allies - Russian President Vladimir Putin, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen. \nMyanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi, Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak and Indonesian President Joko Widodo are coming too, all generally good partners of China. \n\"One Belt, One Road is to date the most important public good China has given to the world, first proposed by China but for all countries to enjoy,\" Wang said. \n\"The culture and historical genes of One Belt, One Road come from the old Silk Road, so it takes Eurasia as its main region,\" he said, adding that representatives of 110 countries would attend. \nWhile China says the New Silk Road is not political, it has run into opposition from India due to a section of it in Pakistan, known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, where some projects run through the disputed Kashmir region. \nWang dismissed those concerns, saying the Pakistan project had no direct connection to the dispute and India was welcome to participate in the New Silk Road. \n\"Indian friends have said to us that One Belt, One Road is a very good suggestion,\" he said. \nNevertheless, India Prime Minister Narendra Modi was not on the list of leaders attending. \nWang also made no mention of any attendance of officials from Japan, South Korea or North Korea, all countries with which China has strained ties. Nor was there mention of Australia, a strong U.S. ally that has close trade links with China. \nThe list included only one leader from the Group of Seven (G7) industrialised nations, Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni. \nDiplomatic sources in Beijing said China had hoped for at least some senior Western leaders to attend, including British Prime Minister Theresa May, to burnish the plan's credentials and make it less China-centric. \nBritish finance minister Philip Hammond will come as May's representative, while Germany and France are having elections at the time and will send high-level representatives, Wang said. \nWang confirmed Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte as among 28 leaders coming, along with the Spanish, Greek, Hungarian, Serb and Polish prime ministers and Swiss and Czech presidents. \n\"This is a positive, cooperative agreement, and we don't want to politicize it,\" Wang told reporters when asked if China was upset at the absence of most major Western leaders. \n\"This is an economic cooperation forum, an international cooperation platform that everyone is paying attention to, supports and hopes to participate in,\" he said. \nGLOBAL FRIEND \nChina is sensitive to any suggestion that what it sees as its benign intentions do not have a receptive global audience, especially in Western capitals. \nChina was privately upset in 2015 after most Western leaders rebuffed invitations to attend a big military parade marking 70 years since the end of World War Two. Western leaders were unhappy that the guest list that included Putin and wary of the message China would send with the show of strength. \nWhile China has portrayed the New Silk Road as a genuine effort to share the bounty of China's economic development and to fund infrastructure gaps, many Western countries are concerned about a lack of detail and transparency in the project and are suspicious about China's broader political intents. \nDiplomatic sources said the presence of Putin and other leaders from countries with dubious human rights records, like the Philippines and Central Asian states, had contributed to a reluctance among Western leaders to attend. \nStill, at a time of uncertainty about the U.S. place in the world following President Donald Trump's pledges to put America first, China sees an opportunity to become more of a global leader and has found a receptive audience for its New Silk Road. \nLeaders from countries that would appear to have little, if any, connection so far to the plan are coming to the summit, including Chile and Argentina. \n\"Everyone wants to be China's friend now with Trump in office,\" said a senior Asian diplomat in Beijing. \nA senior Indonesian government official said China was aiming for a \"spectacular\" summit. \n\"The Chinese are gunning for ... global leadership so I think this OBOR summit is going to be huge,\" the official said. \n(Additional reporting by John Chalmers in Jakarta; Editing by Robert Birsel) ", "title": "Most major Western leaders to skip China's New Silk Road summit", "uuid": "b6f4b45556e6daabb0117299766daf64d295f3bf", "thread": {"title": "Most major Western leaders to skip China's New Silk Road summit", "domain_rank": 408, "site_full": "www.reuters.com", "participants_count": 1, "replies_count": 0, "site": "reuters.com", "published": "2017-04-18T09:09:54.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqBxCFlviO8xCU0MG3V.SHHXblpUNVFstb7M3cNOUFZLjOP58C0Wp.E6y", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "http://www.reuters.com/finance/EarningsUS", "uuid": "b6f4b45556e6daabb0117299766daf64d295f3bf", "performance_score": 7, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 766, "comments": 0, "shares": 766}, "linkedin": {"shares": 49}, "gplus": {"shares": 7}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170418&t=2&i=1180989613&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED3H08B", "title_full": "Most major Western leaders to skip China's New Silk Road summit | Reuters", "section_title": "Earnings News &amp; Latest Company Earnings Results | Reuters.com", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "wells fargo", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dow jones trademark holdings llc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "llc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cnn", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p dow jones indices llc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "standard & poor's financial services llc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago mercantile exchange inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p opco", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "time warner company", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago mercantile association", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dow jones", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cable news network", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "factset", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "factset research systems inc.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "morningstar, inc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "standard & poor's", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "s&p", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "dji opco", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-20T03:36:39.000+03:00", "author": "", "published": "2017-04-20T03:36:39.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC4HiRcMgyqqkFvzfHAr3Lsk9sroL7qO9mEqKsAHveIwCKpG2ot6SoHYW1z7VT6qxQI9FVfQdtyFzHUcC6bPC0kAVV0g7wkSqdS4VoZDMltgQQiiJlKayOjbP7ZLMoVUacQ--", "text": "Stephen Colbert and 'Stephen Colbert' bid farewell to Bill O'Reilly \nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

That sweeping deal covered a dozen nations along the Pacific Rim, but the big prize for the United States was improved access to the 127 million consumers in Japan .\nThat is, until President Donald Trump formally withdrew from the agreement on his fourth day in office. On Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence called TPP \"a thing of the past.\"\n\"The United States seeks stronger and more balanced bilateral trade relationships with every country, including Japan,\" Pence said. \"Our goal is simple: We seek trade that is free, and we seek trade that is fair.\"\nCommerce Secretary Wilbur Ross \u2014 the administration's point person on trade \u2014 joined Pence in Tokyo for bilateral trade talks with Japan's deputy prime minister and other senior officials. Pence emphasized the role of Japanese investment in the United States in creating jobs and fostering economic growth. But some tensions remain: The Treasury Department last week said it is \"monitoring\" Japan's currency practices amid the large trade deficit.\n\"I'm not sure Japan will be that interested\" in a new deal, said Miriam Sapiro, who served as acting U.S. trade representative under President Barack Obama and is now a partner at PR firm Finsbury. \"Some concessions that Japan made because the U.S. asked might not make sense in a bilateral agreement.\"\n\"When trade is restricted, economic engines weaken on both sides of the equation. Protections do more harm than good.\" -Dave MacLennan,  CEO, Cargill For the beef industry, the stakes are particularly high. Japan's tariff on U.S. beef was slated to drop from 38.5 to 9 percent over the next 16 years under TPP. Now producers are pushing the administration to deliver terms that are at least as favorable.\n\"That's the greatest market access ever negotiated \u2014 so far,\" said Kent Bacus, director of international trade at the National Cattlemen's Beef Association, a trade group. \"We're hopeful that the new administration will be able to strike a bilateral deal very soon and either improve upon that or at least get us the 9 percent that TPP would have offered.\"\n'We sell everything but the moo' Opponents of TPP argued that the agreement did not include strong protections for workers and the environment. There were also broad concerns that decades of free trade had done little to help middle-class workers and contributed instead to the steady decline of blue-collar jobs in America \u2014 a frustration that helped fuel Trump's campaign.\nBut Trump also carried key farm states like Iowa and Nebraska, despite his break with the agricultural community over TPP. Beef exports totaled $6.3 billion last year, according to the U.S. Meat Export Federation. Japan accounts for roughly one-sixth of that amount. But Bacus said the market is important for another reason: Japanese consumers are especially interested in what are known in the industry as \"offals\" \u2014 organ meats such as beef tongue that U.S. households are reluctant to buy. In Japan, they can fetch a premium.\n\"My father likes to say we sell everything but the moo,\" said Kelley Sullivan, who runs Santa Rosa Ranch in Texas, one of the largest producers in the state. \"There is nothing lost in a beef cow. And that is really the benefit that we have, and that's where our market again lies.\"\nLower tariffs could mean a big boost in business for the nation's largest beef producers, such as Tyson Foods . On the company's quarterly earnings call in February, Chief Executive Thomas Hayes sounded a cautionary note on the shift in the U.S. stance on trade.\n\"In general, trade restrictions that impact export demand also can affect domestic supply,\" he said. \"We're planning for different scenarios and will be prepared to adapt if there's any change in policy.\"\nCargill , another major beef producer, was more blunt. Chief Executive Dave MacLennan delivered a speech last month titled \"Standing Up for Trade.\" It was a rare foray into public policy for the company, but the message was clear.\n\"When trade is restricted, economic engines weaken on both sides of the equation,\" MacLennan said. \"Protections do more harm than good.\"", "title": "Trump took something from America's cattlemen, and they want it back", "uuid": "5703b818b7f550d94940d98aa98c2d662aa03fef", "thread": {"title": "Trump took something from America's cattlemen, and they want it back", "domain_rank": 767, "site_full": "www.cnbc.com", "participants_count": 1, "replies_count": 0, "site": "cnbc.com", "published": "2017-04-18T17:04:00.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kx8tmYRfAN3Z3hki978e10noqGkJbsHbBUurdDYswosF4c7LakJhD5qqcEjwQvwkZbZ2uwciewPNW6drvpSiBPv5NVKAcKQJQZCs31X.7tZTvNg94gX_c", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "http://www.cnbc.com/id/19789731/device/rss/rss.xml", "uuid": "5703b818b7f550d94940d98aa98c2d662aa03fef", "performance_score": 7, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 718, "comments": 0, "shares": 718}, "linkedin": {"shares": 15}, "gplus": {"shares": 3}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/04/18/104409794-GettyImages-472717706.1910x1000.jpg", "title_full": "Trump took something from America's cattlemen, and they want it back", "section_title": "U.S. Top News and Analysis", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": []}, "crawled": "2017-04-18T14:38:46.000+03:00", "author": "", "published": "2017-04-18T14:38:46.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqBzGyZ9TnVIMurUQvBqtOftmlyDNGyiDoYxCipp7jdR5pQ--", "text": "World News | Tue Apr 18, 2017 | 2:05pm EDT Down in polls, France's Le Pen targets immigration for boost left right Marine Le Pen, French National Front political party leader, reacts at the end of her campaign rally in Paris.

REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol 4/4 By John Irish | PARIS \nPARIS Far-right candidate Marine Le Pen sought on Tuesday to turn the debate in the final week of France's presidential election to immigration as she tried to reverse a dip in polls. \nSurveys of voting intentions have for months shown Le Pen and centrist Emmanuel Macron qualifying on Sunday for the May 7 run-off. But the National Front leader has been under pressure since the start of April as conservative Francois Fillon and far-leftist Jean-Luc Melenchon closed the gap on the favorites. \n(Election graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2lPduBG ) \nSpeaking to a rally in Paris on Monday, she vowed to suspend all immigration with an immediate moratorium, shield voters from globalization and strengthen security. Those subjects won her core backing, and she hopes it can give her boost with about 30 percent of voters still undecided. \n\"For several weeks, we will need to assess the situation. The reality is that immigration is massive in our country and that migration flood that we are experiencing is not a fantasy,\" Le Pen told RTL radio on Tuesday as she fleshed out details of the moratorium announcement. \nThe measure has not been part of her program, although she has put on record that she wants to limit annual immigration to just 10,000 people a year. \n\"I will carry out this moratorium for the exact purpose of implementing this 10,000 figure,\" she said. \nUntil now, Le Pen has struggled to get her opponents in the presidential race to debate her party's trademark tough security and immigration stance. She, by contrast, has been put on the defensive over her position on leaving the euro zone, a proposal that lacks wide support. \nTwo polls on Tuesday showed Fillon and Melenchon still a few percentage points away from Le Pen and Macron. She would be beaten by any of the three others in a run-off, polls have repeatedly shown. \nLe Pen's stance on immigration mainly competes with that of former prime minister Fillon, who despite being plagued by a financial scandal is slowly recovering in the polls, and has also targeted far-right voters. \nFillon told Europe 1 radio on Tuesday that Le Pen's moratorium idea was nonsensical, and that while numbers should come down, the key was to impose the country's values and identity. \n\"Immigration must be regulated because we have an economic, social and housing situation that doesn't enable us to welcome as many people who want to come here,\" Fillon said. \n\"(But) a moratorium makes no sense. What threatens us is not immigration, but the surrender of our values and our history. If we are proud of our history and defend it, then we will integrate foreigners more easily.\" \nSecurity - which Le Pen links closely to immigration - was threatening to once again become a campaign issue on Tuesday after two men were arrested in Marseille, in southern France, on suspicion of planning an attack during the voting. \nMore than 230 people have died in militant Islamist attacks over the past two years, mostly at the hands of home-grown jihadists, often of north African descent. \nHowever, with no major attacks on French soil since last summer, polls show that unemployment, stuck around 10 percent, and political integrity - an issue that has arisen after accusations of nepotism leveled at Fillon in particular since early this year - are bigger issues for voters. \nSARKOZY, JUPPE BACK FILLON \nDespite his recovery, Fillon is arguably in fourth place. One of Tuesday's four opinion polls put him on a lower score than Melenchon, as several others have done in past days and weeks. Those that pit him against the far-left showman in the second round show him losing that battle by a big margin. \nFormer President Nicolas Sarkozy, a divisive figure whose backing may be a mixed blessing for Fillon, on Tuesday urged voters to back the man who served under him as prime minister from 2007 to 2012, and who beat him to the party nomination in November. \n\"He has the experience, the desire and the project that will allow France to ensure an alternative to the last five disastrous years that we have experienced, (under Socialsit president Francois Hollande)\" Sarkozy said in a video message posted on Facebook - a rare foray into the campaign by him. \nAlain Juppe, also beaten by Fillon in the primaries but a more popular figure than Sarkozy, will be at Fillon's side on the campaign trail on Wednesday, a member of Fillon's entourage said. \nMelenchon, meanwhile, was campaigning in Dijon in southeast France, with his trademark hologram image set to be transmitted to rallies in several other cities. \n(Reporting by John Irish; Editing by Andrew Callus, Larry King) ", "title": "Down in polls, France's Le Pen targets immigration for boost", "uuid": "7de417fb2e61eafb457819ab810e4c544b372154", "thread": {"title": "Down in polls, France's Le Pen targets immigration for boost", "domain_rank": 408, "site_full": "www.reuters.com", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "site": "reuters.com", "published": "2017-04-18T14:38:46.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqBzGyZ9TnVIMurUQvBqtOftmlyDNGyiDoYxCipp7jdR5pQ--", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/topNews\r", "uuid": "7de417fb2e61eafb457819ab810e4c544b372154", "performance_score": 7, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 704, "comments": 0, "shares": 704}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 4}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s4.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170418&t=2&i=1181026417&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED3H0MT", "title_full": "Down in polls, France's Le Pen targets immigration for boost", "section_title": "Reuters: Top News", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chicago", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "oscar munoz", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "chris isidore @cnnmoney apr", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "munoz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kirby", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "david dao", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "scott kirby", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "united", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "united airlines", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ual", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united continental", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-19T00:25:09.000+03:00", "author": "", "published": "2017-04-19T00:25:09.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGA3.NJT5K_1bAbhLOVN815_E66CtKMPmiNvj60_19effccD8N0Bzqb8Ds1CoU_f4O33a0n0e.TUo-", "text": "The entire United passenger fiasco No one at United Airlines has lost their job after a passenger was dragged of an aircraft last week. \"It was a system failure,\" said CEO Oscar Munoz in response to a reporter's question on Tuesday. \"There was never a consideration for firing an employee or anyone around it.\" \n\"I'm sure there was a lot of conjecture about me personally,\" Munoz said when asked if any executives had left the company. \"The buck stops here.\" But he said he had spoken with the United Continental board and received its backing. \nThe initial response to the incident by United Continental ( UAL ) made a bad situation worse .

We need more data.\" \nAccording to its website, USAFacts bills itself as \"a first-of-its-kind platform to help interested citizens learn the facts about government in a comprehensive, nonpartisan way.\" \nBallmer started the project, he said, because he wanted to access government finances in the same way that he could access information on his corporate competitors by reading their earnings reports. \n\"I said, 'Where the heck is the 10-K?'\" Ballmer said during the CNBC interview, referring to public companies' quarterly financial reports. \"No such document exists [for the government.]\" \nBut now it does. According to USAFacts government revenue totaled $5.2 trillion in 2014, the most recent year for such data. Some 60% of that is from the federal government, and the rest is from state and local governments. \nAnd Ballmer was surprised to learn 23.2 million people work for the government in some form, for example. But his biggest surprise of all was how hard it is to find such seemingly simple information. \n\"I thought more of it would be summarized someplace,\" he said. \nBallmer said he was motivated to create USAFacts after he retired from Microsoft ( MSFT , Tech30 ) in 2014. In trying to help his wife in her philanthropic work for disadvantaged kids, he was frustrated by how difficult it was to determine how much the government spends on education and Medicaid. \n\"Where does the money go and what kind of outcome does the government get?\" said Ballmer. \"Government should run itself by government numbers, just like a private company should run itself.\" \nHe said that one of the many facts he discovered is that 9% of all U.S. bridges are \"structurally deficient\" -- though that's an improvement from 1980, when that figure was 27%. \n\"Things are getting better, but the question is: Are they getting better fast enough?\" Ballmer said. \"There are kids who, by virtue of where they're born, are trapped in poverty. That's not getting any better.\" \nRelated: Why Steve Ballmer and Bill Gates broke up \nHe told Andrew Ross Sorkin of the New York Times that he spent $10 million creating the database by hiring a team of researchers in Seattle and providing a grant to the University of Pennsylvania. \nBallmer, who also bought the Los Angeles Clippers basketball team for $2 billion as part of his post-Microsoft career, said that he has \"a lot more work to do\" on USAFacts, which crashed during his television appearance.

It has said it has developed a missile that can strike the mainland United States, but officials and experts believe it is some time away from mastering the necessary technology, including miniaturizing a nuclear warhead. \nPence said on Monday the world had seen Trump\u2019s resolve in the past two weeks, with a U.S. missile attack on a Syrian airfield and the dropping of a powerful non-nuclear bomb on Islamic State fighters in Afghanistan. \nThe Trump administration has said military action remains an option for dealing with North Korea. \nBut, mindful that this would likely trigger massive retaliation and casualties in South Korea and Japan, U.S. officials say Trump\u2019s main focus is on tougher economic sanctions. \nU.S. officials say tougher sanctions could include an oil embargo, a global ban on North Korea\u2019s airline, intercepting cargo ships and punishing Chinese banks doing business with Pyongyang. They also say greater Chinese cooperation is vital. \n\u201cDIPLOMACY FIRST CHOICE\u201d \nSusan Thornton, acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asia, said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and China\u2019s top diplomat, State Councillor Yang Jiechi, agreed in a phone call on Sunday on the need for strict enforcement of U.N. resolutions. \nChinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi repeated China\u2019s line that the crisis could only be resolved by diplomacy. \n\u201cI\u2019ve seen that the United States has reiterated it is willing to use political and diplomatic means to resolve this, as this is their first choice,\u201d he told reporters in Beijing. \n\u201cOf course I think that any country will feel that political diplomatic means are of course the first choice,\u201d Wang said. \nPence\u2019s economic discussions in Tokyo will be closely watched to see how hard a line Washington is prepared to take on trade. Trump campaigned on an \u201cAmerica first\u201d platform, and has vowed to narrow big trade deficits with nations such as China and Japan. \nHowever, Trump has also shown willingness to link trade to other issues, saying he would cut a better trade deal with China if it exerts influence on North Korea. \nChina banned imports of North Korean coal, its most important export, in February, and Chinese media have raised the possibility of restricting oil shipments to the North. \nBut North Korea used Chinese-made trucks to display missiles at the military parade on Saturday, according to photographs, underlining the difficulty in enforcing U.N. sanctions. \nChina and North Korea maintain \u201cnormal contacts, including normal business contacts\u201d, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, when asked about the trucks. \n\u201cAt the same time, as a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, China strictly adheres to its international responsibilities, including those from Security Council resolutions,\u201d Lu told a daily briefing. \nImpoverished North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because their 1950-1953 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. South Korea hosts 28,500 U.S. troops to counter the threat from the North. \nTrump\u2019s decision to launch a missile strike against Syria, a Russian ally, drop a giant bomb on Afghanistan and stick with Obama-era policies on Crimea mean Russian hopes of him befriending the Kremlin have been on the slide. \nRussian state media, which hailed his election win, have made a U-turn. On Sunday, media said he was scarier than North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \nFor a graphic on nuclear North Korea, click here \nFor a graphic on Carl Vinson strike group, click here \n(Additional reporting by Sue-Lin Wong in PYONGYANG, Jack Kim, Ju-min Park and James Pearson in SEOUL, Daniel Trotta in NEW YORK, Ben Blanchard in BEIJING and Andrew Osborn in MOSCOW; Writing by Nick Macfie; Editing by Paul Tait, Robert Birsel) Share This:", "title": "Pence reassures Japan of U.S. resolve on North Korea, to work with China", "uuid": "b5c64f7e08fee59372d4407672b7f6302416274d", "thread": {"title": "Pence reassures Japan of U.S. resolve on North Korea, to work with China", "domain_rank": 408, "site_full": "feeds.reuters.com", "participants_count": 1, "replies_count": 0, "site": "reuters.com", "published": "2017-04-18T12:29:27.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgy5Fc689.h046sRBv2S9PHOQ59dAOZBVnK_1oymiHcIgc0oXQBySr3MWwdejbNqvuYudgpUw51cu99gM2oHCm992td3hD7WA6Ntle2ptA_ysnczx_c9bGHf", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "http://www.rocketnews.com/feed/", "uuid": "b5c64f7e08fee59372d4407672b7f6302416274d", "performance_score": 6, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 665, "comments": 0, "shares": 665}, "linkedin": {"shares": 12}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "", "title_full": "Pence reassures Japan of U.S. resolve on North Korea, to work with China", "section_title": "RocketNews |Top News Stories From Around the Globe", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": []}, "crawled": "2017-04-19T02:24:14.000+03:00", "author": "Editor - Finance Top Stories", "published": "2017-04-19T02:24:14.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.0rSU5LtMgy5Fc689.h046sRBv2S9PHOQ59dAOZBVnK_1oymiHcIgWQNyrxxjzs9PHk5X.2wxC.yrHl3iLNhZpXNY0lMnCI67zUMgK9yeSGVsIf.f9SV_w--", "text": "RocketNews nominated for a Webby Award About Us: Rocketnews is an aggregator of the top online news articles and stories from around the globe.

The U.S. president is huddling with advisers on Tuesday to explore whether he should yank America from the international accord aimed at slowing global warming. \nBut some powerful forces -- with real skin in the game -- are urging Trump not to abandon the 2015 Paris deal brokered among more than 175 nations. \nSurprisingly, it's the big oil companies who are vocally supporting the climate agreement, joining others in the administration that include Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner. \nSpecifically, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell and BP are all in favor of America staying in the Paris COP21 pact, which former President Obama hailed as \"the moment that we finally decided to save our planet.\" \nA BP ( BP ) spokesman told CNNMoney that it \"welcomed the Paris agreement when it was signed, and we continue to support it... \n\"We believe it's possible to provide the energy the world needs while also addressing the climate challenge,\" BP said. \nChevron ( CVX ) told CNNMoney it \"supports continuing with\" the Paris deal because it \"offers a first step towards a global framework.\" \nExxon ( XOM ) , the biggest US oil company that Tillerson used to lead, sent a letter to the White House last month hailing the Paris agreement as an \"effective framework for addressing the risks of climate change.\" \nA Shell ( RDSA ) spokesman confirmed that the energy giant remains \"strongly in favor\" of the Paris deal. \nRelated: Exxon to Trump: Don't ditch Paris deal \nAt first glance, it might seem surprising to hear that Big Oil isn't seizing on the shifting political environment to poke holes in a deal that undermines fossil fuels like crude oil. \nAfter all, Trump himself has called climate change a \"hoax\" and blasted COP21 as a \"bad deal\" for the U.S. (Trump later told The New York Times he has an \"open mind\" about the agreement). \nBut these traditional energy companies have a vested financial interest in the Paris deal. That's because COP21's crack down on carbon emissions favors natural gas, which emits much less pollution than coal. \nWhile Exxon, BP and Shell are primarily identified as oil companies, they are actually diversified energy firms that rely heavily on natural gas to make money. \nFor instance, 42% of Exxon's total daily production last quarter was actually in natural gas, according to FactSet. BP and Shell also lean on natural gas for a large chunk of their output. \n\"These companies view natural gas as a key growth area going forward for them. It just makes sense for them to be at the table,\" said Brian Youngberg, senior energy analyst at Edward Jones. \nNatural gas production has soared over the past decade, thanks to the abundance of shale gas in North America. \nAnd now there's the added benefit that governments are cracking down on carbon emissions. \nBP's statement mentioned its commitment to \"reducing emissions in the power sector by producing and marketing natural gas.\" \nAnd Shell needs to protect its massive $50 billion investment last year to acquire BG Group, a sizable producer of natural gas. \nShell put out a report in February predicting that demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) -- natural gas that is turned into a liquid to ship it where it's needed -- will jump by 4% to 5% each year to 2030. The report highlighted that governments like that natural gas produces half the greenhouse gas emissions that coal does when it's burnt to produce electricity. \n\"You're going to see extreme growth in LNG,\" Youngberg said. \nRelated: Russia could soon control a U.S. oil company \nCheap natural gas -- not tough environmental regulations -- has been the leading cause of the demise of coal. Still, last month Trump tried to provide the badly struggling coal industry a boost by starting to undo Obama's Clean Power Plan that aimed to cut carbon emissions by power utilities, one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases. \nCheniere Energy, ( LNG ) a natural gas company, sent the White House a letter on Monday describing the Paris agreement in terms that would fit Trump's America First ethos. \nThe Paris accord is a \"useful instrument for fostering demand for America's energy resources and supporting the continued growth of American industry,\" Cheniere wrote. \n--CNNMoney's Chris Isidore contributed to this report. \nCNNMoney (New York)   18, 2017: 12:27 PM ET", "title": "Why Big Oil wants Trump to stay in Paris climate agreement - Apr. 18, 2017", "uuid": "13f7ae05b996f7f4627d2111354021f9b99623de", "thread": {"title": "Why Big Oil wants Trump to stay in Paris climate agreement - Apr. 18, 2017", "domain_rank": 81, "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "site": "cnn.com", "published": "2017-04-18T20:27:00.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGA3.NJT5K_1a.i5AeH4mdlFKYJnCE57kGA5MDuyMFW4FJ5DCKiSVJZi5.DnIXpNGgbQEJy1n4nqI-", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "", "uuid": "13f7ae05b996f7f4627d2111354021f9b99623de", "performance_score": 6, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 630, "comments": 0, "shares": 630}, "linkedin": {"shares": 36}, "gplus": {"shares": 5}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.2, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170418132305-trump-oil-exxon-paris-780x439.jpg", "title_full": "Why Big Oil wants Trump to stay in Paris climate agreement - Apr. 18, 2017", "section_title": "", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": []}, "crawled": "2017-04-19T17:25:02.000+03:00", "author": "", "published": "2017-04-19T17:25:02.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGlfE6_B6LKpC3cnAzrMekk_jfY0PD.68WVv43HLKTPnrqeUHfoL7ZDqKpO7VUi1JfJbFs8_qSLvmpdtsDJcV6.Q--", "text": "India to Trump: America still needs our tech workers by Rishi Iyengar @Iyengarish April 19, 2017: 8:36 AM ET Trump threatens Indian engineers' American Dream India has a message for President Trump: Curbing visas for skilled workers won't solve America's problems. \nTrump signed a \"Buy American, Hire American\" executive order on Tuesday , promising to protect U.S. workers by overhauling the H-1B visa program that is used mainly by Indian engineers and developers. \nIt's unclear how the program may change, but India's huge tech industry says America still has a shortage of skilled workers that the H-1B system was designed to ease. \n\"That core issue has not been addressed,\" said R. Chandrashekhar, president of India's software and services companies association Nasscom. The U.S. tech industry's need for skilledworkers is only \"accelerating because of intense competition,\" he told CNNMoney on Wednesday. \nIndian workers receive more than 70% of all H-1B visas, which are initially valid for three years. U.S. government data shows that nearly 127,000 were granted to Indian applicants last year. \nA majority of them work in the tech sector -- some for U.S. firms, others for Indian outsourcing companies such as Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys ( INFY ) , who provide services for huge swathes of corporate America. \nTrump and other critics of the program say it is abused by those Indian firms, who -- they claim -- flood the visa lottery with applications and then send workers to the U.S. on salaries that undercut their American counterparts. \nNasscom rejected those claims again in a statement on Wednesday. \n\"The current campaign to discredit our sector is driven by persistent myths, such as the ideas that H-1B visa holders are 'cheap labor' and 'displace American workers' who 'train their replacements,' none of which is accurate,\" the Indian industry association said. \nIn fact, India says its $150 billion tech industry actually creates American jobs. \n\"We continue to invest in the local communities in which we operate, including hiring local American top talent, bringing education and training to our clients to shrink the skills gap in the U.S.,\" Infosys said in a statement. \nTata Consultancy Services declined to comment on the new executive order. \nRelated: H-1B visa applications decline for first time in 5 years \nThe Trump administration has so far only called for a review of the H-1B program without proposing any concrete changes. India says the review should take into account the needs of American companies. \n\"As the process goes forward we believe that a more thoughtful and a more logical approach is desirable, keeping in view the impact on American businesses,\" Chandrashekhar said. \"Measures to protect American workers will not be successful if they are applied selectively.\" \n-- Omar Khan contributed to this article.

The company has assembled a team of 60 scientists and engineers to work on the future of communication at Building 8, the company's mysterious new hardware division. \n\"What if you could type directly from your brain? It sounds impossible, but it's closer than you think,\" said Regina Dugan at Facebook's F8 conference in San Jose. Dugan is an ex-DARPA, Motorola and Google executive who Facebook ( FB , Tech30 ) hired last year to lead Building 8. \nThe human brain is streaming the equivalent of 40 HD movies every second. We only share some of those thoughts as speech, which Dugan describes as essentially a compression algorithm. \nHer team is working on new technology that can essentially read your mind using sensors and optical imaging, then translate that information into words. \nThere are some examples of this type of technology already, but they are slow and require surgical implants. Facebook showed a video of a woman with ALS who, with the help of implants, is able to type eight words a minute without moving her fingers. \n\"We have a goal of creating a system capable of typing 100 words per minute, five-times faster than you can type on your smartphone, straight from your brain,\" said Dugan. \nRelated: Facebook wants to beam the internet down from helicopters \nFiring off emails while knitting or playing with your kids is only the first step. Our brains don't actually think in text, said Dugan. When you think of a cup, you're thinking of the object and the idea, not \"C-U-P.\" The same technology could be used to read that thought and share it in any language. \n\"Understanding semantics means that one day you may be able to choose to share your thoughts independent of language. English, Spanish or Mandarin -- they all become the same,\" said Dugan. \nAnother early stage technology the Building 8 team is testing involves touch. They want to make it possible to \"hear through your skin.\" Dugan showed a video of an early test where a Facebook engineer wore a special sleeve containing a system of actuators. It lets her feel \"the acoustic shape of a word on her arm.\" The engineer has learned the unique feeling of around nine words, what Facebook calls a tactile vocabulary. \n\"One day not so far away, it may be possible for me to think in Mandarin and for you to feel it instantly in Spanish,\" said Dugan. \nCNNMoney (San Jose)   19, 2017: 3:23 PM ET", "title": "Facebook building tech to help you to type with your brain and 'hear' with your skin", "uuid": "b40705b5baceee4cb6c009bf885bf418ee241314", "thread": {"title": "Facebook building tech to help you to type with your brain and 'hear' with your skin", "domain_rank": 81, "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "participants_count": 1, "replies_count": 0, "site": "cnn.com", "published": "2017-04-19T23:03:46.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGlfE6_B6LKpC3cnAzrMekk_pDMAz39Lty1EqRgfc_ABxJqqrhTF8yibKnsws8OYaz", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_latest.rss", "uuid": "b40705b5baceee4cb6c009bf885bf418ee241314", "performance_score": 6, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 601, "comments": 0, "shares": 601}, "linkedin": {"shares": 17}, "gplus": {"shares": 2}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170419121719-regina-dugan-f8-780x439.png", "title_full": "Facebook building tech to help you to type with your brain and 'hear' with your skin - Apr. 19, 2017", "section_title": "Latest financial news - CNNMoney.com", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "bill o'reilly", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "will bill o'reilly", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "dana perino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "watters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "eric bolling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "perino", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "o'reilly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murdoch", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bret baier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fox", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "megyn kelly", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greg gutfeld", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jesse watters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "laura ingraham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "greta van susteren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "ingraham", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "carlson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tucker carlson", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bolling", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mike allen", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "fox news", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "new york times", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-19T21:28:20.000+03:00", "author": "Tom Kludt and Dylan Byers", "published": "2017-04-19T20:49:00.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGlfE6_B6LKpDKfT95mYPX.ee5roSFMJkC.wP80Yne8XwDqpZ07z0DdquDatAHW9e5nGJ6hpR2XyFpYf.ph1GN2g--", "text": "Will Bill O'Reilly return to his show? Speculation over whether Bill O'Reilly will keep his job at Fox News has given way to a new question: Who will replace him as the network's biggest star? The answer may come sooner rather than later, given that representatives for Fox and O'Reilly are already discussing his exit. \nRelated: Source: Fox News and Bill O'Reilly are talking exit \nThere are several theories floating around the halls of Fox News, according to current and former employees there. The most prominent theory has Fox News moving Tucker Carlson to the 8 p.m. hour and backfilling the 9 p.m. hour with with a new host. \nEric Bolling, Greg Gutfeld and Dana Perino, all co-hosts on Fox's popular evening roundtable show \"The Five,\" have each pinch-hit for O'Reilly while he's been out on vacation, and all are possible replacements at either 8 or 9 p.m. \nOne widely discussed theory inside the building is that Fox would move all of \"The Five\" to 8 or 9 p.m. That option would get popular hosts like Bolling and Perino into primetime, and would also give Fox News a unique offering different from the one-person shows so familiar across cable news. \nAnother theory, which sources said was less likely, has Carlson moving to 8 p.m. and newsman Bret Baier taking over at 9 p.m., restoring a news program to prime time, which Fox's lineup has been missing since Megyn Kelly's departure. \nIf O'Reilly is in fact dropped, he would be the third evening host to leave the network in the last year, following the departures of Kelly and Greta Van Susteren. \nThat could perhaps make the Murdoch family, who have been deliberating over O'Reilly's future for weeks, eager to replace O'Reilly with a female host. \nPerino isn't the only woman who might be considered. Laura Ingraham, a Fox News contributor who also hosts a popular radio show, could also be a candidate.

Speculation over whether Bill O'Reilly will keep his job at Fox News has given way to a new question: Who will replace him as the network's biggest star? \nThe answer may come sooner rather than later, given that representatives for Fox and O'Reilly are already discussing his exit. \nRelated: Source: Fox News and Bill O'Reilly are talking exit \nThere are several theories floating around the halls of Fox News, according to current and former employees there. The most prominent theory has Fox News moving Tucker Carlson to the 8 p.m. hour and backfilling the 9 p.m. hour with with a new host. \nEric Bolling, Greg Gutfeld and Dana Perino, all co-hosts on Fox's popular evening roundtable show \"The Five,\" have each pinch-hit for O'Reilly while he's been out on vacation, and all are possible replacements at either 8 or 9 p.m. \nOne widely discussed theory inside the building is that Fox would move all of \"The Five\" to 8 or 9 p.m. That option would get popular hosts like Bolling and Perino into primetime, and would also give Fox News a unique offering different from the one-person shows so familiar across cable news. \nAnother theory, which sources said was less likely, has Carlson moving to 8 p.m. and newsman Bret Baier taking over at 9 p.m., restoring a news program to prime time, which Fox's lineup has been missing since Megyn Kelly's departure. \nIf O'Reilly is in fact dropped, he would be the third evening host to leave the network in the last year, following the departures of Kelly and Greta Van Susteren. \nThat could perhaps make the Murdoch family, who have been deliberating over O'Reilly's future for weeks, eager to replace O'Reilly with a female host. \nPerino isn't the only woman who might be considered. Laura Ingraham, a Fox News contributor who also hosts a popular radio show, could also be a candidate. Ingraham, who was considered for a role inside the Trump administration, has also filled in for O'Reilly over the years. \nRelated: Part of Bill O'Reilly's problem at Fox: Few people there actually like him \nSo has Jesse Watters, the controversial Fox correspondent who has had a regular segment on the \"Factor.\" He too has been called on to fill in for O'Reilly at times, and earlier this year he began hosting his own weekend program, \"Watters World.\" Last month, Watters landed an interview with President Trump. \nFox could, conceivably, look beyond its current ranks for a replacement.

( bit.ly/2oMiHL4 )\n\"Republicans are eager to work with the president to end and replace the Dodd-Frank mistake with the Financial CHOICE Act because it holds Wall Street and Washington accountable, ends taxpayer-funded bank bailouts, and unleashes America\u2019s economic potential,\" the Texas Republican said in a statement.\nThe blueprint of Hensarling's bill has been known for some time. He first introduced a similar measure in 2016, where it passed his committee but was not considered by the full House.\nRepresentative Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the committee, has dismissed Hensarling's bill.\n\u201cThe new version, which is even worse than Chairman Hensarling\u2019s first draft, cannot be allowed to become law. There is too much at stake for consumers and for our economy at large,\" she said in a statement earlier this month.\nThe 2010 Dodd-Frank law established strict rules on the financial sector to prevent a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis. Republicans like Hensarling, as well as President Donald Trump, believe the regulations put an undue burden on businesses and have held back the economy by restricting lending.\nBut Hensarling's ambitious approach, which would eliminate huge portions of Dodd-Frank, faces an uncertain political future beyond the House. At least eight Democrats would need to support a financial reform bill in the Senate for it to pass, and the major changes proposed by Hensarling are not expected by industry experts to garner that type of support.\nInstead, the Senate is expected to take a slower, piecemeal approach to revisiting financial rules, with a focus on changes that could garner bipartisan support.\nHensarling's bill would make a host of changes to financial rules in the United States. For example, banks could significantly increase the amount of capital they hold, and in turn no longer have to adhere to a host of existing Dodd-Frank rules.\nHensarling's bill also severely restricts the power of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, while bringing it under much stricter oversight by Congress. The measure is likely to be met with strict opposition by Democrats in Congress.\n(Reporting by Pete Schroeder; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)", "title": "U.S. House banking chairman unveils Dodd-Frank replacement", "uuid": "4adbb4d2231feebcff6244dbad9664f62be7c282", "thread": {"title": "U.S. House banking chairman unveils Dodd-Frank replacement", "domain_rank": 408, "site_full": "www.reuters.com", "participants_count": 1, "replies_count": 0, "site": "reuters.com", "published": "2017-04-20T01:11:02.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqByEp1U2inwrCntlMMYLLbL9IzCzgvE6X8qyyAZrDtpQGwOvcXWB3PjR", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "http://www.reuters.com/politics", "uuid": "4adbb4d2231feebcff6244dbad9664f62be7c282", "performance_score": 5, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 574, "comments": 0, "shares": 574}, "linkedin": {"shares": 19}, "gplus": {"shares": 6}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170419&t=2&i=1181260499&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED3I1Q7", "title_full": "U.S. House banking chairman unveils Dodd-Frank replacement | Reuters", "section_title": "Politics &amp; Political News | Reuters", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "new york", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glassdoor", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "andrew chamberlain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "chamberlain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glassdoor", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "social work  women", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "environmental science  women", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-19T21:28:24.000+03:00", "author": "Kathryn Vasel", "published": "2017-04-19T16:35:00.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGlfE6_B6LKpCM21W3mlnXbnkwwP5PpFmRHu2Z8ZGtbc.oRuBBwWT5RXnGgmB3SN6iYrd584FwNP4ezzVY8Mnyeg--", "text": "How long will it take to close the gender pay gap? Your college major can have a lasting impact on how much money you make over your career -- for better or worse. What you major in can lead to career and pay gaps, particularly for women, according to a new report from Glassdoor . \n\"Women tend to major in subjects that lead to lower-paying roles later on,\" said Andrew Chamberlain, Glassdoor's chief economist. \nThose choices create a \"pipeline problem,\" in which women are less represented in majors that lead to jobs with higher earnings potential. \nNine out of the 10 highest-paying majors are dominated by males, the report found, while six out of the 10 lowest-paying majors were dominated by females. \n\"Majors do make a difference,\" said Chamberlain. \"You are going to be working for the rest of your life, your decision can mean hundreds of thousands of dollars.\" \nOn average, college-educated women earn about 88 cents for every dollar a man made in the five years after graduation, the report found. That figure is higher than the most recent government data that showed women earned 79.6 cents for every dollar men made in 2015. The government report compared pay among all full-time, year-round workers. \nRelated: 5 things to know about the gender pay gap \nThe size of the pay gap varies among majors. \nIt's the largest among health care administration majors. Women earned 78 cents for every $1 a man earned -- a 22% difference. After five years, men with this major earned a base pay of $51,250 compared to $40,000 for women. \nEven when men and women have the same major, a disparity can still exist because men are more likely to work in more senior roles, the report found. \nFor instance, the most commonly-held jobs for men with health care administration majors were implementation consultant, quality specialist and data consultant. For women, it was administrative assistant, customer care representative and intern. \nThe study was based on nearly 47,000 resumes submitted on Glassdoor from graduates who completed college between 2010 and 2017. \nCollege majors aren't the only factor in gender pay disparities. Barriers like stereotypes and bias can also impede pay parity and workplace advancement. \nRelated: Why women lag behind men when it comes to money \nDegrees that lead to women out earning men \nWomen in some majors go on to do better than their male colleagues. For example, women with architecture degrees earn $7,000 more per year on average than men, a 14% gap favoring women. \nAccording to Glassdoor, here are the 10 college majors that lead to the biggest pay gaps in favor of women. \n1. Architecture \nWomen earn $1.14 for every $1 men earn \n2. Music \nWomen earn $1.10 for every $1 men earn \n3. Social Work \nWomen earn $1.08 for every $1 men earn \n4. Advertising \nWomen earn $1.08 for every $1 men earn \n5. Environmental Science \nWomen earn $1.07 for every $1 men earn \n6. Chemical Engineering \nWomen earn $1.05 for every $1 men earn \n7. Kinesiology \nWomen earn $1.05 for every $1 men earn \n8. Mechanical Engineering \nWomen earn $1.03 for every $1 men earn \n9. Sports Management \nWomen earn $1.02 for every $1 men earn \n10.

Sturgeon says this means Scotland should have another chance to vote on secession.\n\"If the SNP wins this election in Scotland and the Tories (Conservatives) don't, then Theresa May's attempt to block our mandate to give the people of Scotland a choice over their own future when the time is right will crumble to dust,\" Sturgeon told reporters in London.\nThe Scottish parliament last month backed Sturgeon's bid to hold a new referendum in 2018 or 2019, but May rejected the proposal.\nPolls suggest Scots do not believe the timing is right for another referendum, and although support for independence itself has been broadly steady at around 45 percent or more the SNP is predicted to win most Scottish seats in the snap poll.\nMay's decision to push for a national ballot will exacerbate tensions within the historic union of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales.\nScots are disgruntled at the idea of a Brexit they rejected while Northern Ireland, which also voted to stick with the EU, is mired in a political crisis made tougher to resolve by the fray of campaigning.\n\"I don't see that Scotland has featured in May's calculations at all, and she has most certainly ignored Northern Ireland,\" said Professor Michael Keating of the University of Aberdeen, adding May's proposal could backfire in Scotland.\n\"The Prime Minister is seeking a UK-wide mandate for her version of Brexit. If the SNP get between 50 and 59 seats it will be difficult to deny that they have a Scottish mandate for their vision.\"\nThe SNP currently has 54 of Scotland's 59 seats in the British parliament in Westminster. May's Conservatives, which had their lowest share of vote in Scotland in a general election in 2015, have just one Scottish seat but hold an overall majority in the 650-seat House of Commons.\nMay told Sturgeon last month that now was \"not the time\" to discuss independence with Britain's relationship with the EU in the balance.\nBut Sturgeon shot that argument back at May, pointing out that the prime minister was calling a national election despite having previously insisted it would be wrong for the country.\nIn the event they win seats from the SNP, the Conservatives are likely to seek to portray it as evidence that nationalists are losing momentum.\nThe Scottish Conservatives' leader Ruth Davidson said in a newspaper column on Wednesday that having \"traded successfully on a sense of momentum and inevitability\" for years, the election would show the SNP was now \"going downhill.\"\nDavidson led the Conservatives to second place in 2016 Scottish parliament elections and many see her popularity as a fresh hope for the party in Scotland.\n(Reporting by Estelle Shirbon in London and Elisabeth O'Leary in Edinburgh; editing by Michael Holden and Guy Faulconbridge)", "title": "Scotland's Sturgeon says attempt to block independence vote will 'crumble to dust'", "uuid": "f975913657dbc31d0a5d6bbf8fd72011ab54234c", "thread": {"title": "Scotland's Sturgeon says attempt to block independence vote will 'crumble to dust'", "domain_rank": 408, "site_full": "www.reuters.com", "participants_count": 1, "replies_count": 0, "site": "reuters.com", "published": "2017-04-19T19:18:00.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqByEXEsKSbsfVk2jav9HBCksOuHYWoeVvvnX3TBLUkYjYtenBVDIZaS7oTEfTK90e9Q-", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "http://www.reuters.com/subjects/euro-zone", "uuid": "f975913657dbc31d0a5d6bbf8fd72011ab54234c", "performance_score": 5, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 572, "comments": 0, "shares": 572}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s2.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170419&t=2&i=1181201744&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED3I0V3", "title_full": "Scotland's Sturgeon says attempt to block independence vote will 'crumble to dust' | Reuters", "section_title": "Euro Zone | Reuters.com", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "feedzilla", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "house", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "dodd-frank", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bbc", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yahoo", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "metacafe", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "news corporation", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-20T02:51:03.000+03:00", "author": "Editor -

Will he? \nThose are two of the outstanding questions now that Fox News has canceled \"The O'Reilly Factor.\" \nO'Reilly's public statement on Wednesday gave no indication about what he might do next. He said he wishes \"only the best for Fox News Channel.\" \nRelated: Bill O'Reilly out at Fox News \nBut he could seek to cross the proverbial street and appear on a competing channel. While Fox's two biggest rivals, CNN and MSNBC, would not be interested in hiring him, conservative upstarts like Newsmax or One America News (OANN) could be. \n\"I'd love to talk to him,\" Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy told CNNMoney Wednesday afternoon. \nRuddy said he would want to know more about the issues surrounding O'Reilly's ouster from Fox. But \"I'm not closing the door\" on O'Reilly \"just because there were allegations that were not confirmed,\" he said. \nA source close to O'Reilly said the broadcaster has not given much thought to his Fox-less future yet. \nWhen he left for vacation last week, he told viewers that he'd be back on the \"Factor\" soon. \nAt least until Tuesday his representatives had been holding out hope that the Murdochs would continue to support him. \nWhen the Murdochs went the other way, O'Reilly prepared a statement with the help of his agents and crisis communications adviser. \n\"It is tremendously disheartening that we part ways due to completely unfounded claims,\" O'Reilly said. \nO'Reilly observers are curious to see if the hot-tempered host will channel his anger into some sort of new project. \nOn the other hand, the 67-year-old mused about retirement last year, saying \"I don't want to work this hard much longer.\" He still went ahead and signed a new contract with Fox, however. \nIt is unclear if the exit agreement between Fox and O'Reilly limits his ability to appear on other networks. So-called \"non-compete\" clauses are common but not universal. \nWednesday's new denial by O'Reilly -- calling the harassment claims unfounded -- may be significant to potential business partners. \nAny channel looking to hire O'Reilly would have to weigh the damage that has been done to his reputation against the loyalty of his his fans. \nO'Reilly was a ratings magnet at Fox -- but it's hard to know how much of his audience would follow him to another network. \nThe channels that are trying to challenge Fox, like Newsmax, have much smaller profiles and are harder to find on the dial. \nOANN, for example, is available in about 35 million households in the U.S., while Fox News is available in almost 100 million. But the channel recently earned some attention by hiring former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski as a commentator. \nCharles Herring, the president of Herring Networks, which owns OANN, said he expected Fox would replace O'Reilly with a highly capable host, but he's hopeful that \"viewers migrate to One America News.\" \nNewsmax TV, Glenn Beck's The Blaze and Sinclair Broadcasting have also been mentioned as possible suitors for O'Reilly. \nRuddy, of Newsmax, said Wednesday, \"I think Bill O'Reilly was the heart and soul of that network, and he has unparalleled and unchallenged talent. I think he's still a hot commodity.\" \nThe \"Factor\" was the hub of O'Reilly's business, but he has many other spokes, including a line of best-selling books and stage shows at theaters. \nHis book publishing partner, Henry Holt, said Wednesday that \"our plans have not changed.\" \nThe National Geographic channel has turned several of O'Reilly's books into TV movies. When Variety asked about the next one in development, \"Killing Patton,\" the channel said \"we're not making any decisions today.\" CNNMoney (New York) First published April 19, 2017: 6:20 PM ET", "title": "What will Bill O'Reilly do now?", "uuid": "4bd1a35b95e11b5f48e1e8ac77cfebd4c01f3665", "thread": {"title": "What will Bill O'Reilly do now?", "domain_rank": 81, "site_full": "money.cnn.com", "participants_count": 1, "replies_count": 0, "site": "cnn.com", "published": "2017-04-20T01:36:58.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGlfE6_B6LKpCWV_SPHrRku9aIri4kqOT3tlluoGAVVWxawKv1GR7lEj.0nSJODslN", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_latest.rss", "uuid": "4bd1a35b95e11b5f48e1e8ac77cfebd4c01f3665", "performance_score": 5, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 568, "comments": 0, "shares": 568}, "linkedin": {"shares": 51}, "gplus": {"shares": 4}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/170403151334-bill-oreilly-white-house-780x439.jpg", "title_full": "What will Bill O'Reilly do now? - Apr. 19, 2017", "section_title": "Latest financial news - CNNMoney.com", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "australia", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canada", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hong kong", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reddit", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "china", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "canberra", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "britain", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "u.k.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "india", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "alec macfarlane", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "malcolm turnbull", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "trump", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "european union", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-18T12:48:12.000+03:00", "author": "", "published": "2017-04-18T12:48:12.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/2wGaacqxApsw5GGC2pSnC7lLDLzSw7BGA3.NJT5K_1Z_C4Q1fvjoTZK.dU4YhHZEV_1IVWavhqVGROUhdHEYKOc2_IKafG6OaXGazD8xulPJzQsfkTaL_SzMATcgmhRq", "text": "Australia first: Country overhauls visa program for skilled workers by Alec Macfarlane @CNNMoney April 18, 2017: 7:22 AM ET Reddit co-founder: Immigration is personal to me Working in Australia as a foreigner is about to get tougher. \nAustralian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said Tuesday that the country is overhaulinga visa program that allows skilled workers from abroad to hold jobs for up to four years. \n\"We are an immigration nation. But the fact remains, Australian workers must have priority for Australian jobs,\" Turnbull said in a video announcement posted on Facebook. \nThe current visa program, known as 457, was intended to allow employerstoplug gaps in the Australian labor market. It will be replaced by two temporary visas, one for two-year stays and another for four-year stays. \nRelated: H-1B visa applications decline for first time in 5 years \nThe number of eligible jobs for the visas will be cut from 651 to 435, and application fees will rise. The government said the visas will be restricted to filling critical skills shortages. \nThe new visas will require at least two years of previous work experience, better English language ability, stricter labor-market testing and a criminal background check. \nCurrent 457 visa holders won't be affected by the changes, the government said. Around 96,000 people held the visas in Australia at the end of September, down nearly 8% from a year earlier, according to the latest official data. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said Australian workers must have priority for Australian jobs. \nIndia accounted for about 25% of the foreign citizens participating in the program, followed by the U.K. (20%) and China (6%). \nSpeaking at a press conference in Canberra shortly after the announcement, Turnbull said the decision to abolish the visa was made following a review of the system. \nRelated: Where millionaires are moving: Australia tops the list \nTurnbull also announced the establishment of a new training fund to help Australians fill skills gaps that currently exist in the country. \nStill, some immigration experts say the new visa requirements will have little overall impact on immigration levels in Australia. \n\"It seems like a lot of change, but it's more of a cosmetic [rebranding] than anything else,\" said Henry Sherell, a research officer at the Development Policy Center of the Australian National University. \"A lot of the communication around this is political. They would've been able to achieve many of the changes they announced today under the current program.\" \nHe described the move as \"clever politicking\" by Turnbull to placate right-wing members of his coalition. \nThe move comes amid increased worldwide attention on Australia's immigration system, which was recently cited as a model for the U.S. by President Trump. \nTrump said last month that he wants an immigration system like Canada's or Australia's -- one that's \"merit-based\" and ensures those entering the country can bolster the economy. \nTrump is expected Tuesday to sign an executive order calling for a review of the U.S. H-1B visa program for skilled workers, with the goal of reforming the program, senior administration officials said. \nBritain's move to exit the European Union has also created uncertainty about the future of migrant workers there.

Facebook Inc on Wednesday pulled aside the curtain on a secretive unit headed by a former chief of the Pentagon's research arm, disclosing that the social media company is studying ways for people to communicate by thought and touch.\nFacebook launched the research shop, called Building 8, last year to conduct long-term work that might lead to hardware products. In charge of the unit is Regina Dugan, who led a similar group at Alphabet Inc's Google and was previously director of the U.S. Defense Department's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA.\nDugan told software developers at Facebook's annual F8 conference that the company was modeling Building 8 after DARPA, a government office founded in the 1950s that gave the world the internet and the miniaturized GPS receivers used in consumer devices.\nAny hardware rollouts are years away, Dugan said in a speech. Potential products could, if successful, be a way for Facebook to diversify beyond its heavy reliance on advertising revenue.\nOne example of Building 8's work so far, Dugan said, was an attempt to improve technology that allows people to type words using their minds.\n\"It sounds impossible, but it's closer than you may realize,\" Dugan said.\nUsing brain implants, people can already type eight words a minute, she said. Facebook's goal, working with researchers at several U.S. universities, is to make the system non-invasive, as well as fast enough so that people can type 100 words a minute just by thinking.\nPossible uses include helping disabled people and \"the ability to text your friend without taking out your phone,\" she said.\nAnother Building 8 project, she said, was trying to advance the ability to communicate through touch only, an idea with roots in Braille, a writing system for the blind and visually impaired.\nA video played at the conference showed two Facebook employees talking to each other through touch. As one employee, Frances, wore an electronic device on her arm, the other, Freddy, used a computer program to send pressure changes to her arm.\n\"If you ask Frances what she feels,\" Dugan said, \"she'll tell you that she has learned to feel the acoustic shape of a word on her arm.\"\nIn December, Facebook signed a deal with 17 universities including Harvard and Princeton to allow swifter collaboration on projects with Dugan's team.\n(Reporting by David Ingram; Editing by Peter Cooney)", "title": "Facebook gives peek inside unit studying brain-to-text technology", "uuid":

But how you follow through on those ideas matters just as much. \nYou don't only need to think like a millionaire \u2014 you need to act like one. \nIn \" The Top 10 Distinctions Between Millionaires and the Middle Class ,\" Keith Cameron Smith shares the insights he gleaned from spending two years working with and studying the ultra-rich, including the actions and attitudes that distinguish them from the average person.\nHere are four ways to start acting like a millionaire, regardless of what's in your bank account. \nMillionaires talk about ideas, not things \nIt's not that cars, movies and other people aren't interesting to wealthy individuals. But they tend to focus more on big ideas for the future than on the minutiae of what's happening in the present.\n\"Millionaires are creative,\" Smith says. \"They spend time thinking about new ideas.\"\nWhile middle class people talk about cars and movies, millionaires own the car companies and produce the movies. They understand that \"ideas are the most valuable asset in the world.\"\n\"To become more successful, you must continually expand your mind,\" Smith writes. \"In a world where everything is changing fast, you would be wise to spend time thinking of new ways of doing things.\"\nshow chapters Rich people use these 6 mental tricks to make more money      Friday, 21 Oct 2016 | 10:00 AM ET | 01:10 Millionaires take calculated risks \nWhile middle class people are often content to stay in their lane, millionaires strive to move out of theirs. Put another way, the middle class lives in fear of risking too much, while millionaires know when to go for it.\nThis happens because \"millionaires overcome fear and the middle class submits to it,\" Smith says.\n\"Millionaires overcome fear with knowledge,\" he continues. \"Millionaires educate themselves before taking risks, and then they consider the consequences of failing.\"\nThey calculate the intensity of the risk versus the power of the reward. \"If you can live with the worst thing that could happen and if the most likely thing to happen will get your closer to your goals, then go for it!\" Smith writes.\nMiquel Benitez | Getty Images Facebook CEO and co-founder Mark Zuckerberg. Millionaires are generous \nWhile middle class people often believe they can't afford to give, rich people see generosity as a necessity.\n\"Most millionaires believe in the law of sowing and reaping,\" Smith says. \"They see money as a seed. Millionaires know that if they are generous, they will receive more in return.\"\nNumerous millionaires and billionaires have become philanthropists. In 2010, Warren Buffett and Bill Gates teamed up to form The Giving Pledge , an effort that encourages the ultra-rich to donate the majority of their wealth to good causes. More than 150 billionaires have signed on, including Mark Zuckerberg, Richard Branson and Elon Musk.\n\"Not all millionaires are generous, but the happy ones are!\" Smith writes.\nshow chapters Self-made millionaire: Working too hard is not the cause of burnout      Thursday, 23 Feb 2017 | 10:53 AM ET | 01:11 Millionaires cultivate multiple sources of income \nThe more sources of income you have, the more potential you have to rake in big paychecks. Smith gives the example of a fisherman with one line cast versus a fisherman with five lines. Who is going to catch more fish?\nBut developing multiple streams of income means letting go of a mindset that often holds the middle class back: The idea that you must do everything yourself, which \"puts extreme limits on your financial potential,\" Smith says.\n\"Millionaires have a different belief,\" he writes. \"They believe they can find someone who can do it not only as well as they can, but even better!\"\nshow chapters Warren Buffett made $53,000 by age 17      Tuesday, 31 Jan 2017 | 10:31 AM ET | 00:53 Smith emphasizes that creating sources of passive income is crucial to building wealth. That means putting in effort up front but eventually leaving more qualified people in charge so they can move on to the next income-generating project. Don't try to be in charge of everything \u2014 that only leads to burnout.\nMillionaires focus on the big-picture aspects of a project without getting bogged down in the minute details.\nAgain, this is a divergence from the middle-class mindset that you have to do everything yourself. \"The middle class believes that if you attempt to build multiple sources of income, you will spread yourself too thin,\" Smith explains. \nDon't miss : If you want to be a millionaire, start thinking like one \nshow chapters Millionaires are the new middle class      Friday, 3 Mar 2017 | 10:46 AM ET | 01:01", "title": "Things millionaires do that middle class doesn't", "uuid": "bd5eeacf5047a53334295b061b88c23c0d2a4f99", "thread": {"title": "Things millionaires do that middle class doesn't", "domain_rank": 767, "site_full": "www.cnbc.com", "participants_count": 1, "replies_count": 0, "site": "cnbc.com", "published": "2017-04-18T18:22:00.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8kx8tmYRfAN3Z3hki978e17nuKNsQzWk9LszR3yalw5agZw.BCTsfg.fW4KpU2ol1pJgAJ3j1fSaffkkok0btWox6kQ4W9KgcwfRoF81XWDw--", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "http://www.cnbc.com/id/10001054/device/rss/rss.html", "uuid": "bd5eeacf5047a53334295b061b88c23c0d2a4f99", "performance_score": 5, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 525, "comments": 0, "shares": 525}, "linkedin": {"shares": 62}, "gplus": {"shares": 4}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://fm.cnbc.com/applications/cnbc.com/resources/img/editorial/2017/02/24/104303596-kathryn.1910x1000.jpg", "title_full": "Things millionaires do that the middle class doesn't", "section_title": "Wealth", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}, {"highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "jerusalem israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "israel", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "khan sheikhoun", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "united states", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "idlib", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "syria", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "russia", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "assad", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "bashar al-assad", "sentiment": "neutral"}, {"name": "jeffrey heller", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "avigdor lieberman", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "alison williams", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "jean-marc ayrault", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "organisation for the prohibition of chemical", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "yedioth ahronoth", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "hezbollah", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "reuters", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-20T00:46:23.000+03:00", "author": "Reuters Editorial", "published": "2017-04-20T00:46:23.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_j2VtuVwYvbp9ncZxaH4d.B01AkNufqBy_pkOl3McuhCMYUrZEpXfCeOGeJIMG6yAjkgOucg_P.MWKEcFLKtdprx1kYNoATq8-", "text": "World News | Thu Apr 20, 2017 | 6:13am EDT Israel says Assad's forces still have several tonnes of chemical weapons Syria's President Bashar al-Assad speaks during an interview with AFP news agency in Damascus, Syria in this handout picture provided by SANA on April 13, 2017. SANA/Handout via REUTERS \nJERUSALEM Israel's military said on Wednesday it believes Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces still possess several tonnes of chemical weapons, issuing the assessment two weeks after a chemical attack that killed nearly 90 people in Syria. \nIsrael, along with many countries, blames the strike on Assad's military. French Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said French intelligence services would provide proof of that in the coming days. \nA senior Israeli military officer, in a briefing to Israeli reporters, said \"a few tonnes of chemical weapons\" remained in the hands of Assad's forces, a military official told Reuters. \nSome local media reports quoted the briefing officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with Israeli military procedure, as putting the amount at up to 3 tonnes. \nIn a 2013 agreement brokered by Russia and the United States, Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons. \nEarlier in the day, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical weapons, a global watchdog, said sarin or a similar banned toxin was used in the April 4 strike in Syria's Idlib province. \nThe findings supported earlier testing by Turkish and British laboratories. \nIsraeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman told Israel's Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper on April 6 that he was \"100 percent certain\" that the attack was \"directly ordered and planned by Assad\". He did not elaborate on how he reached that conclusion. \nSyria has repeatedly denied it was behind the attack in Khan Sheikhoun. Assad was quoted as saying last week that Syria's military gave up all its chemical weapons in 2013 after the agreement made at the time, and would not have used them anyway. \nIsrael closely monitors the civil war in Syria, a northern neighbour. During the six-year conflict, Israel has largely stayed on the sidelines, carrying out occasional air strikes against what it says is the movement of weapons to Iranian-backed Lebanese Hezbollah militants. \n(This version of the article corrects sourcing in paragraph 3) \n(Reporting by Jeffrey Heller; Editing by Alison Williams) ", "title": "Israel says Assad's forces still have several

REUTERS/NASA/Handout via Reuters/File Photo By Tom James \nAn asteroid more than a quarter mile (400 meters) wide will pass close to Earth on Wednesday, zooming by at a distance of just over a million miles (1.8 million km), but with no chance of impact, according to NASA scientists. \nSmaller asteroids routinely make closer passes to Earth, but 2014 J025, discovered in May 2014, will be the largest asteroid to come this near to the planet since 2004, flying by at only about 4.6 times the distance from the Earth to the Moon, 1.1 million miles (1.8 million km). \n\"We know the time that the object is going to be closest within seconds, and the distance is known within hundreds of kilometers (miles),\" Davide Farnocchia, a mathematician at NASA's Near-Earth Object program, said by telephone on Tuesday. \nHaving several years of data on the asteroid's trajectory gives scientists the ability to predict its path very confidently, he added. \nThe asteroid, estimated to be between one-quarter and three-quarters of a mile (600-1,400 meters) wide and twice as reflective as the Moon, won't be visible to the naked eye, but sky watchers should be able to view it with home telescopes for one or two nights starting on Wednesday. \nThe approach of J025 will be the asteroid's closest for at least the next 500 years. \nIn 2004, the 3.1-mile (5-km) wide asteroid Toutatis passed about four lunar distances, or just under a million miles (1.6 million km) from Earth. \nAmateur astronomers may be watching J025's journey, but Farnocchia said he and his colleagues have moved on to tracking even closer encounters, such as asteroid 1999 AN10, a half-mile (800-meter) wide rock predicted to pass only 236,000 miles (380,000 km) from Earth, or slightly less than the distance to the Moon, in 2027. \n(Reporting by Tom James in Seattle; Editing by Patrick Enright and Sandra Maler)", "title": "Large asteroid to pass close to Earth on Wednesday: NASA", "uuid": "f77ae31e40c9b14bf19985bcb734a91701296252", "thread": {"title": "Large asteroid to pass close to Earth on Wednesday: NASA", "domain_rank": 408, "site_full": "uk.reuters.com", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "site": "reuters.com", "published": "2017-04-19T01:03:54.000+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/Mx2PHH_4C23Hx5x5mO3ytR2ETjc6BWrbp9u06f2cUmdkdFusfJjMxX9jSb2iFwx2iwAsOTewtMyT2ZOHmJyHgw--", "site_categories": [], "site_section": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/UKScienceNews/", "uuid": "f77ae31e40c9b14bf19985bcb734a91701296252", "performance_score": 7, "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 429, "comments": 0, "shares": 703}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}}, "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "main_image": "http://s3.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170418&t=2&i=1181103772&w=&fh=545px&fw=&ll=&pl=&sq=&r=LYNXMPED3H1AK", "title_full": "Large asteroid to pass close to Earth on Wednesday: NASA", "section_title": "Reuters: Science News", "country": "US"}, "rating": null, "highlightTitle": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "language": "english"}], "moreResultsAvailable": 0, "requestsLeft": 788, "next": "/search?token=86b3b0d7-10fa-4025-b410-6898f9019d7d&format=json&ts=1492489542455&q=language%3A%28english%29+thread.country%3AUS+performance_score%3A%3E4+%28site_type%3Anews%29+site_category%3Afinance&sort=social.facebook.likes&from=100&sort=desc"}
