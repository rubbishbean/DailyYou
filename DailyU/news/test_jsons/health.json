Many factors make HIV prevention among transgender people a challenge. Terminology \nTransgender is a term for people whose gender identity or expression is different from their sex assigned at birth. Gender identity refers to a person\u2019s internal understanding of their own gender. Gender expression describes a person\u2019s outward presentation of their gender (for example, how they dress). Transgender women describes people who were assigned the male sex at birth but identify as women. Transgender men describes people who were assigned the female sex at birth but identify as men. The Numbers \n\u2022 In the United States, it is estimated that almost 1 million adults identify as transgender. a \u2022 From 2009 to 2014, 2,351 transgender people were diagnosed with HIV in the United States. b Eighty-four percent (1,974) were transgender women, 15% (361) were transgender men, and less than 1% (16) had another gender identity.\u2022 Around half of transgender people (43% [844] of transgender women; 54% [193] of transgender men) who received an HIV diagnosis from 2009 to 2014 lived in the South. c \u2022 A 2013 report found that the estimated percentage of transgender women living with HIV in the United States was 22% among 2,705 transgender women sampled.\u2022 Among the 3.3 million HIV testing events d reported to CDC in 2013, the percentage of transgender people who received a new HIV diagnosis was more than 3 times the national average. HIV Diagnoses Among Transgender People in the United States by Race/Ethnicity, 2009-2014 Source: Clark H, Babu AS, Wiewel EW, Opoku J, Crepaz N. Diagnosed HIV Infection in Transgender Adults and Adolescents: Results from the National HIV Surveillance System, 2009-2014 . December 2016. Prevention Challenges Multiple factors have put transgender people at risk for HIV infection and transmission , including multiple sexual partners, anal or vaginal sex without condoms or medicines to prevent HIV, injecting hormones or drugs with shared syringes and other drug paraphernalia, commercial sex work, mental health issues, incarceration, homelessness, unemployment, and high levels of substance misuse compared to the general population, as well as violence and lack of family support. HIV behavioral interventions developed for other at-risk groups have been adapted for use with transgender people. However, the effectiveness of these interventions is understudied. Effective behavioral interventions that address the full range of risk factors and health concerns are needed to improve the health of transgender people. Many transgender people face stigma, discrimination, social rejection, and exclusion that prevent them from fully participating in society, including accessing health care, education, employment, and housing. These factors affect the health and well-being of transgender people, placing them at increased risk for HIV. Insensitivity to transgender issues by health care providers can be a barrier for transgender people diagnosed with HIV and seeking quality treatment and care services. Few health care providers receive proper training or are knowledgeable   and their unique needs. This can lead to limited health care access and negative health care encounters. Transgender-specific data are limited . Some federal, state, and local agencies do not collect or have complete data on transgender individuals. Using the two-step data collection method of asking for sex assigned at birth and current gender identity can help increase the likelihood that transgender people are correctly identified in HIV surveillance programs. Accurate data on transgender status can lead to more effective public health actions. Transgender men\u2019s sexual health has not been well studied . Over half of transgender men with diagnosed HIV infection had no identified or reported risk. Additional research is needed to understand HIV risk behavior among transgender men, especially those who have sex with other men. What CDC Is Doing \nCDC and its partners are pursuing a high-impact prevention approach to maximize the effectiveness of current HIV prevention methods among transgender people. Activities include: Awarded $11 million per year for 5 years, beginning in 2011, to community-based organizations (CBOs) to provide HIV testing to young gay and bisexual men and young transgender people of color. A new funding opportunity focusing on this population will begin in 2017 and continue for 5 years, depending on the availability of funds. Supporting health department demonstration projects that provide pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) support services and data-to-care activities prioritizing gay and bisexual men and transgender people at substantial risk for acquiring HIV, particularly people of color. Providing support and technical assistance to health departments, CBOs, and providers to support interventions for transgender people (e.g., condom distribution, community mobilization, HIV testing, and coordinated referral networks and service integration). Through its Capacity Building Assistance initiative, CDC is working with   to support   . This day promotes   efforts among transgender people. Developed   people, including campaigns such as: Doing It , which encourages all adults to get tested for HIV and know their status, and includes images and testimonial videos featuring transgender leaders. Let\u2019s Stop HIV Together , which raises awareness about HIV and fights stigma, and includes the stories of transgender women. HIV Treatment Works , which encourages people living with HIV to stay in care, and features transgender women\u2019s stories of staying healthy while living with HIV. Start Talking. Stop HIV. , which helps gay and bisexual cisgender and transgender men communicate about safer sex, testing, and other HIV prevention issues. \na According to Williams Institute scholars, this estimate likely does not represent the entire transgender population. National surveys in the future may observe higher numbers of transgender people. \nb This data may underreport HIV diagnoses among transgender people because of challenges in accurately identifying and reporting gender identity in HIV surveillance. \nc Includes Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Mississippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia. \nd An HIV testing event is one or more HIV tests performed with a person to determine that person\u2019s HIV status. During one testing event, a person may be tested once or multiple times. \nFor more information, visit CDC\u2019s Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Health website .

While Texas is experiencing a 20-year high in mumps cases, public health officials report nearly 2,000 cases across 42 states and the District of Columbia since January. That number is on track to top last year\u2019s total by about 50%. \nPublic health officials in Texas alerted health care professionals there to be on the lookout for mumps, tracing some exposures to college students on spring break on South Padre Island. As of mid-April, Texas has had 221 mumps cases this year, the most since 1994.\nSpread by close person-to-person contact, the mumps virus attacks the salivary glands, leading to puffy cheeks and swollen jaws.\nThe CDC is ''certainly concerned about the increases in mumps cases,\" says spokesman Ian Branam. He says the agency is looking at things that may be behind the rise in cases, including:\nThe disease spreads more easily in crowded settings such as college campuses. The mumps vaccine may not always work. The vaccine's effect may decrease over time. The CDC recommends that a child get two doses of the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, the first at 12 to 15 months old and the second at 4 to 6 years old.\nIn addition to puffy cheeks and swollen jaws, symptoms of the respiratory virus include fever and headaches, says Amanda Porro, MD, a pediatrician at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami.\n\"You are contagious about 3 or 4 days'' before the infection shows symptoms, Schaffner says.\nBranam says while most cases are mild, mumps can occasionally be serious. \"It can cause complications, especially in adults, such as meningitis or inflammation of the testicles (orchitis) in males who have reached puberty, Branam says.\" Rarely, this can lead to infertility. \"Before there was a vaccine, mumps was one of the most common causes of deafness and meningitis in childhood,\" he says.\nChildren who are vaccinated and still become infected are less likely to have serious illness, Branam says.\nWhile there is no specific treatment other than plenty of rest and fluids, Porro recommends getting checked out by a doctor for complications once you have swollen cheeks.\nPeople spread the virus through saliva. If you are living somewhere with a mumps outbreak, avoid sharing items like forks and spoons, cups, lipstick, and cigarettes, along with activities such as kissing. \nExperts are also researching the best ways to prevent more outbreaks.\nA group within the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) is discussing whether to add an additional dose of the vaccine when there\u2019s an outbreak, Branam says. The group will present its recommendations to the full committee by February 2018.\nSchaffner and Porro also suggest that students at a college or university consider getting another dose of the vaccine if an outbreak happens.", "crawled": "2017-04-18T09:23:23.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "2fe1eafd5e4a4c06890c7fedb47eb9ab8e9ec07f", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 978, "likes": 978}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}}, "country": "US", "site": "webmd.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.webmd.com/rss/rss.aspx?RSSSource=RSS_PUBLIC", "uuid": "2fe1eafd5e4a4c06890c7fedb47eb9ab8e9ec07f", "section_title": "WebMD Health", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 9, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp3_ipfEQ8HH8HUoBv5xcz4gAqCDT4JV0aLYMKMsrGTNp0GP2ALbG0aONDRhhidtclbMzp.kPR7Hk58_TtxBST5o6AXlQcj3fekHsJYRF4A--", "domain_rank": 322, "main_image": "http://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/video/basics_mumps_video/650x350_basics_mumps_video.jpg", "site_full": "www.webmd.com", "title_full": "Mumps Cases Surge in U.S.", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Mumps Cases Surge in U.S.", "published": "2017-04-17T03:00:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "u.s."}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "texas"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "district of columbia"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "south padre island"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "miami"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "amanda porro"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "porro"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "schaffner"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "branam"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ian branam"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "cdc"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "mmr"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "nicklaus children's hospital"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "acip"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cdc's advisory committee on immunization practices"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Dp3_ipfEQ8HH8HUoBv5xcz4gAqCDT4JV0aLYMKMsrGTNp0GP2ALbG0aONDRhhidtclbMzp.kPR7Hk58_TtxBST5o6AXlQcj3fekHsJYRF4A--", "author": "Kathleen  Doheny", "external_links": [], "title": "Mumps Cases Surge in U.S.", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Want a healthy brain as you age? Live a healthy life April 17, 2017 \nROCHESTER, Minn. \u2014 Adopting a healthy lifestyle can protect the brain against several risk factors for Alzheimer\u2019s disease , Mayo Clinic research shows. Controlling blood pressure and cholesterol and avoiding obesity , smoking and diabetes are among the steps that can help preserve brain health, according to the study, published in JAMA Neurology . \nNeurologists believe two aspects make up Alzheimer\u2019s disease: Amyloid deposits: Toxic proteins that build up plaques on the brain. Neurodegeneration: Loss of structure and function of neurons in the brain. \nThe Mayo research examined whether the risk factors and protective steps against each differ. \n\u201cThis is a hot topic of investigation, because the more we learn about biomarkers, the more we will learn about risk and protective factors against Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\u201d says senior study co-author Ronald Petersen, M.D., Ph.D. , director of Mayo Clinic\u2019s Alzheimer\u2019s Disease Research Center . \u201cThe notion of exceptional brain aging is relevant here \u2014 why some people have lower degree of Alzheimer\u2019s disease-causing brain changes even at advanced ages and higher genetic risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\u201d \nThe study found that: High cholesterol was the only predictor among the midlife risk factors \u2014 apart from demographics and the presence of apolipoprotein E gene \u2014 that raises the risk of amyloid deposits, the key factor underlying Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Midlife obesity, smoking, diabetes and high blood pressure, as well as late-life cardiac and metabolic chronic conditions, were associated with greater Alzheimer\u2019s disease-pattern neurodegeneration. Intellectual enrichment did not significantly predict formation of amyloid deposits or neurodegeneration, suggesting that it is mainly protective against cognitive decline. \n\u201cIt is important to note that fewer midlife risk factors and fewer chronic health conditions contribute to lower risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease dementia,\u201d says first author Prashanthi Vemuri, Ph.D. , a Mayo Clinic dementia researcher. \u201cFor healthier brain aging, managing one\u2019s overall health over a lifetime is vital.\u201d \nThe study looked at 942 people ages 70 to 89 enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging . Researchers used brain scans that show amyloid formation and neurodegeneration, and investigated what factors protect individuals from both. They also looked at \u201cexceptional agers\u201d \u2013 people 85 and older with no significant evidence of Alzheimer\u2019s disease on their brain scans. \n\u201cThe research shows that exceptional aging without major signs of Alzheimer\u2019s disease may be possible with a greater number of protective factors across the life span,\u201d Dr. Vemuri says. \nFuture research should investigate independent and combined protective factors against amyloid and neurodegeneration, Dr. Vemuri says. Better prevention strategies could help delay the onset and progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease, she says.

Permanent Tattoo \nThis method of ID'ing your pet involves tattooing a unique code or information on the inner pinna (ear flap), the tummy or inner leg of a mature (fully grown) pet. Ideally, ID tattoos are done while an animal is under anesthesia for another procedure. Otherwise, a sedative and local anesthesia should be used. \nTattooing is the method I use to permanently identify my pets. I put my phone number (which hasn't changed in a very long time) on their inner thighs. Obviously, if your phone number or other personal information changes frequently, this may not be a good option for you. \nAnother potential downside is that you have to hope the person who finds your pet knows to look for a tattoo, and this is especially challenging if your pet is very furry. In this case, the earflap is a better location for a tattoo, but many people don't like earflap markings for aesthetic reasons. \nYou can increase the likelihood your tattooed pet will be returned to you by registering the number with AKC Reunite , the National Dog Registry or Tattoo-a-Pet . \nAny number can be registered with the National Dog Registry, and all tattooed animals can be enrolled in the AKC Reunite program regardless of species, age, size or number used. \nA drawback to a tattoo is that it may fade or blur over time and become difficult to read. Another layer of black ink can be applied to restore the tattoo. Microchips \nMicrochips are about the size of a grain of rice. They are injected under the skin in the neck area between the shoulders, and provide a permanent means of identifying your pet. \nMicrochip placement is very similar to a vaccination. A bit of loose skin between the animal's shoulder blades is gently pulled up, and the needle containing the chip is inserted. \nThe trigger is depressed, injecting the microchip beneath the skin. I don't get many requests for microchipping, but since the injection can be a bit painful, when I'm asked to place one, I always use a local anesthetic. \nEach chip is equipped with an electromagnetic transponder with a unique code that must be registered with a recovery program like HomeAgain or Avid . If a pet is lost, most veterinary offices, shelters and humane societies have scanners that can locate the chip inside the animal's body and read the code on it. \nAs long as your pet's microchip has been registered and your information is up-to-date in the recovery program database, the chip has not migrated too far from the injection site and the person scanning for the chip has the correct scanning device and knows what he or she is doing, it should be relatively easy to reunite you with your furry family member. \nIt's important to know that the safety of microchips has been a concern for many pet guardians and many of us in the holistic veterinary community. Although very rare, tumors have been associated with implanting foreign objects in pets. \nFor a very current update on the pros and cons of microchips, including issues surrounding the universality and accuracy of chip scanning devices, my friend Dr. Jean Dodds at Hemopet and NutriScan recently posted an in-depth article I encourage you to read: \" Microchipping Pets .\" ID Tags \n\u2022 Standard ID tags . A standard pet ID tag is made of plastic or metal and dangles off your pet's collar or harness. \nTags are engraved with owner contact info \u2014 usually just a phone number due to space constraints \u2014 and either the pet's name or a short phrase like \"Needs Meds\" or \"HUGE Reward for Return\" (which I prefer). \nThe benefits of this type of tag are the cost and the fact that a Good Samaritan who finds your pet can call you immediately as long as your current phone number, including area code, is engraved on the tag. \nIt's also a good idea to have a backup phone number engraved below yours in case you can't be immediately reached for some reason. \nA drawback to standard ID tags is that the engraving can wear off over time, making the tag impossible to read. There's also the need to be diligent in keeping the tag updated with your current contact information, and insuring your pet is never, ever without her collar or harness. \n\u2022 Digital ID tags . These are ID tags or collars that are linked to an online subscription service (PetHub is one) and have the added advantage of being \"scannable\" with a smartphone. \nYou need to have an online profile of your pet linked to the tag or collar. There are options to have additional information on the tag or collar, and there are basic (free) and premium (paid) subscription levels. \n\u2022 USB ID tags . These are USB thumb/flash drives that attach to your pet's collar or harness like a standard ID tag, and can store complete care information for your pet. \nIt's a good idea to do some research and read reviews of the various brands available, because some have more options than others. Another consideration is the person who finds your pet will need to have access to a computer and know what to do with the USB thumb/flash drive in order to ID your pet and find you. GPS Tracking Devices \nGPS trackers are designed more for owners who want to monitor the comings and goings of an off-leash pet than for people hoping to recover a lost dog or cat. These devices don't identify your pet if someone finds him \u2014 their purpose is to help you pinpoint his location if he ventures past the \"virtual fences\" you set up as alerts. \nThis type of device can be a good investment if you spend time engaging in outdoor activities with your dog off-leash. If you happen to live on a large piece of property and your pet has the run of the place, it might also come in handy. \nAnother situation in which it might be useful is if your pet is a habitual runner or escape artist . Obviously, in that case, your pet needs some intensive behavior modification to curb her tendency to run off, but a GPS device might offer an added measure of security. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Devices \nRFID pet tags and collars are essentially microchips your pet wears rather than has implanted. More akin to GPS trackers than a way to help recover a lost pet, RFID devices help you find or keep your pet within a certain roaming range. Audio and visual clues point you in the direction of your pet's location. \nEach method for ID'ing your pet has pros and cons, so the ultimate decision is yours and should be based on your pet's personality and lifestyle, as well as your comfort level with the identification method you choose for your furry family member. \nI recommend that every pet have a standard up-to-date ID collar or tag in addition to whatever other ID method their owner chooses, since the easiest, fastest way for someone who has found your pet to find you, is to take a quick look at the contact info contained on his tag or collar. 0", "crawled": "2017-04-17T22:15:14.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-17T13:00:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "b400523cc061d655f8de75b0fa0e34522890693a", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 940, "likes": 940}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 6}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 11}}, "country": "US", "site": "mercola.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://articles.mercola.com/sites/mainfeed.aspx", "uuid": "b400523cc061d655f8de75b0fa0e34522890693a", "section_title": "", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 9, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWasxINCeJlgvbzGjfldeymyez2NQhfuHDDbzadQsQ8XAzuWgtw1PHIX2EntIQrj5uoLlrQgcA6_Dm8Mlwlm1bjUE4EJSCeQIbb_NpW33fXEXX8JJgeZVGNR", "domain_rank": 2440, "main_image": "https://media.mercola.com/ImageServer/Public/2017/April/national-pet-id-week-fb.jpg", "site_full": "healthypets.mercola.com", "title_full": "Too Many Pets Are Permanently Lost This Way", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Too Many Pets Are Permanently Lost This Way", "published": "2017-04-17T13:00:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWasxINCeJlgvbzGjfldeymyez2NQhfuHDDbzadQsQ8XAzuWgtw1PHIX2EntIQrj5uoLlrQgcA6_Dm8Mlwlm1bjUE4EJSCeQIbb_NpW33fXEXX8JJgeZVGNR", "author": "Dr. Becker", "external_links": [], "title": "Too Many Pets Are Permanently Lost This Way", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "\nHEALTH TIP OF THE WEEK What's considered moderate alcohol use?

One time, the doctor, possibly frustrated after seeing this otherwise perfectly healthy child over and over again for the common cold, looked at my mother and said, \u201cYou have to let this baby get dirty.\u201d I imagine my freshly bathed sister sitting there in an immaculately laundered outfit, looking as if her baby feet had never once touched the Earth. \nMy mom was horrified. She had wanted a baby very badly, and once she got one, she was determined to do everything right. Didn\u2019t doing everything right include keeping your baby safe from germs? Bathing them every day? Keeping the dirt from under their fingernails? Well, it turns out that the doctor who saw my sister in the late 1960s knew exactly what he was talking about. WebMD says that the research consistently shows that germs can be good, especially for infants. In fact, babies who are exposed to germs are less likely to get asthma and allergies as adults. \nDespite her reluctance, my mom listened to the doctor, because more than anything, she didn\u2019t want her baby to get sick anymore. She slowly began to let my sister play on the floor and in the dirt, and eventually, my sister\u2019s constant bombardment with ailments began to go away. By the time I came around, I pretty much spent my entire childhood rolling around on the ground outside with the dogs and the bugs and the snakes and the frogs. \nOur kids need to get dirty. \nIn fact, Thom McDade, PhD, associate professor and director of the Laboratory for Human Biology Research at Northwestern University says that \u201cthe young immune system is strengthened by exposure to everyday germs so that it can learn, adapt, and regulate itself.\u201d That\u2019s like saying that our immune systems need to be challenged in life, or they figure they can go and retire in Florida and play shuffleboard and leave us coughing and wheezing away. \nWe evolved over time interacting daily and intimately with microbes and bacteria, and not only are they around us, but they live inside of us too. In fact, here is a wacky fact that might make you feel completely gross: Our bodies are inhabited by 3 to 10 times as many nonhuman cells as human cells. This includes things like viruses, fungi, and yes, bacteria. I don\u2019t know about you, but fungi?! WTF, bodies. \nIt makes sense that, since our bodies are actually made up of so much bacteria, we also don\u2019t constantly try to get rid of all the bacteria around us. Yes, we also need to stop using all the damn antibacterial stuff. Studies are showing that, not only do antibacterial soaps lack any benefits over using regular old soap and water, but that they could be harmful in that they potentially increase the risk of drug-resistance. \nSuperbugs = not good. \nOur kids need to get plucked right down into the natural world and get it all over them. They need to catch worms and splash in mud puddles and smear all sorts of stuff on their faces when we aren\u2019t looking. We need to stop hovering and worrying about them staying clean or staining their shirt. They don\u2019t need baths every day . They just need healthy food, lots of exercise, and dirt. \nThey probably even need to lick random stuff and eat their boogers, but I just don\u2019t want to think about any of that.", "crawled": "2017-04-17T04:33:27.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-17T04:33:27.000+03:00", "uuid": "007fa4de04e462747ae855afd371fa42adb064fe", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 944, "likes": 944}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "scarymommy.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.scarymommy.com/feed/", "uuid": "007fa4de04e462747ae855afd371fa42adb064fe", "section_title": "Scary Mommy", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 9, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8C1Q610nHYYevCfzN9JDN6ErOSkXfqJs46raSIbKEsxiIHI0Sbns1yNqNXB6qkj.43hK5lvfcwdW1oszkiBX_a", "domain_rank": 10926, "main_image": "http://www.scarymommy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/let-kids-get-muddy.jpg", "site_full": "www.scarymommy.com", "title_full": "Let The Kids Get Filthy.

Dr. Scanlan is giving a lecture on the immune system and cancer, and I'm eager to hear what she's uncovered in her most recent research. \nShe explained that in her lecture she'll start with a discussion of the interaction between the immune system and cancer \u2014 how cancer fights off the immune system, as well as how the immune system fights off cancer. \n\"I'm going to end my talk with some really interesting things that are being done with the immune system in human medicine,\" said Dr. Scanlan. \"It hasn't hit us veterinarians yet, but it's something to look forward to.\" The Immune System's Cancer-Fighting Cells \nI asked Dr. Scanlan to talk about how the immune system affects cancer. \n\"If everything is going well,\" she explained, \"the immune system fights off cancer with two or three main types of cells. There are the macrophages, which are sort of general garbage eaters. There are natural killer cells. They don't just eat, they destroy. They look for abnormal cells. \nThe third type is the cytotoxic killer cell. These cells are primed to destroy a specific kind of cell. The way they get primed is the macrophages eat the cells and present pieces of them to the cytotoxic killer cells, which teaches the killer cells which type of cell to look for and destroy.\" How Cancer Cells Hide From the Immune System \nOne of the ways cancer cells avoid being attacked by immune system cells is by hiding. One of the ways cancer cells hide is by coating themselves so the immune system can't see the markers that would normally tell it the cancer cells are abnormal for the body. \nAnother method cancer cells use to hide is by producing a specific antibody that prevents the immune system from recognizing them as cancer. \nSince cancer cells are more or less an abnormal replication of naturally-occurring cells in the body, I asked Dr. Scanlan how the immune system recognizes them as abnormal. \n\"When you have abnormal cells, there are little markers on the outside that inform the immune system they are cancer,\" Dr. Scanlan explained. \n\"Also, cancer cells are constantly mutating, and the mutations have new kinds of markers. So even if the older cancer cells are hiding, new ones constantly appear and the immune system can recognize those as a problem. \nThe second thing the immune system does, is it sends out chemical signals like interferon that sort of jazz up the immune system so the parts of it that are working start working even better.\" \nI asked Dr. Scanlan why the immune system doesn't always work when fighting cancer. \n\"Because cancer is so inventive,\" she replied. \"It mutates so much that sooner or later there's an overwhelming population of cells the body can't handle, or the population is so dangerous and destroys so much tissue the body can't handle it. \nEven though the immune system is successfully fighting against, say, 90 percent of the cancer cells, the remaining 10 percent gradually develops into the final, fatal disease.\" Exciting Advances in Human Cancer Research \nNext I asked Dr. Scanlan to talk about advances in human cancer research. \"One of the things they're doing is looking at ways to make the immune system more efficient,\" she replied. \nFor example, they'll draw blood from a person with cancer, remove the white blood cells and mix the remainder with pieces of the person's cancerous tumor. \nThey add certain things to sort of \"supercharge\" the blood cells, wait for them to multiply and return them to the cancer patient. These supercharged cells also have a memory that recognizes cancer cells when they reappear, even after months or years, and goes after them again. \nIt's almost like pulling out your blood, pulling out the tumor, reminding your blood what it was supposed to do and failed, giving it a pep talk and sending it back to fight the battle. \n\"That's it,\" agreed Dr. Scanlan. \"And they've recruited more clones. They're cloning these things. It's like a multiplied army that's going back into battle.\" \nI asked her if the technique is working. \"Yes,\" she replied, \"they've tried it with stage 3 and stage 4 cancers, which are the cancers that are growing and spreading to other parts of the body \u2014 the worst stages of cancer to have. Those are the ones they tested the technique on. \nSome of them (tumors) went away. Others didn't go away, but they shrank and just sort of stayed there without growing any further. They've had some really good success with those, and especially on stage 3 and 4 melanomas, which are very difficult, as well as the really bad kind of breast cancer that women die in their 30s from.\" Recommendations for Treating Canine Cancer \nI asked Dr. Scanlan if this cancer treatment, called immuno-augmentative therapy, has implications in veterinary medicine. \n\"Absolutely,\" she replied. \"First of all, it's kind of expensive. Since it is a relatively new therapy, they're still kind of working out the details. \nBut one of the things that will happen for vets is as more and more people are treated, the cost will come down because they're going to be more efficient at multiplying those cells. When it gets to a point where that's reasonable for animals, then it'll be our turn.\" \nSince the treatment isn't yet available for pets, I asked Dr. Scanlan what she would recommend for a dog diagnosed with cancer today. \n\"There are two main things,\" she said. \"One is to help the immune system itself. There are two main groups of herbs that really help it out. One is the whole mushroom family. There are a number of mushroom products out there. \nThey have done research on mushrooms and they actually stimulate the cells of the immune system in ways that are similar to immuno-augmentative therapy in humans. They make immune system cells stronger, more active, and able to make more of the little chemical messengers. \nThe second way is there are Chinese herbs that are really helpful and that specifically stimulate the immune system. In Chinese medicine, they call that Wei Chi. In addition, there are herbs that actually have specific effects on cancer cells. \nThey're not doing anything with the immune system, but they help beat back the cancer. They reveal the hidden markers and things like that. Things in the astragalus family or Chinese medicine with astragalus as part of the formula, formulas that have red clover in them, things like essiac and hoxsey . \nThere are a lot of them out there. Some are more effective than others. But holistic vets are familiar with them. We try to use the ones that have the most support behind them.\" Where to Go for More Information on Cancer Research and Treatment \nI asked Dr. Scanlan if she customizes natural treatment protocols based on the type of cancer a pet has. Are the therapies she mentions beneficial for all types of cancers \u2014 sarcomas, carcinomas, blood borne tumors? \nShe explained that in terms of immune boosters, they are generally good for all types of cancer with the caveat that we have to be a bit careful if the type of cancer the animal has is acting on the immune system, for example, lymphoma or leukemia. For those, she would go with an immune normalizer or modulator versus an immune booster. \nDr. Scanlan further explained there are formulas that are more effective for sarcomas, others for carcinomas, some that are more effective for soft tumors, different ones for small hard tumors, etc. I asked Dr. Scanlan where people can go to learn more about these things. She suggests that interested veterinarians become members of the AHVMA to keep up with cutting edge research. \n\"The American Holistic Veterinary Medical Foundation ( AHVMF ) also has a place on their website where we are starting to publish news of these types of breakthroughs,\" said Dr. Scanlan, \"including the things about herbs and herbal formulas, as well as immune therapies and things like that.\" \nIf you're a pet owner watching or reading here today and want more info, you can also visit the AHVMA and AHVMF websites. If there's no holistic veterinarian in your area, keep in mind that some veterinarians listed in the AHVMA site also do phone consultations.

In this interview, Scott Carney, an investigative journalist, anthropologist and author of \" What Doesn't Kill Us: How Freezing Water, Extreme Altitude and Environmental Conditioning Will Renew Our Lost Evolutionary Strength ,\" \nThe book reveals how environmental conditioning can improve your health by boosting your metabolic efficiency. A large portion of the book focuses on Dannish fitness guru Wim Hof's philosophies. 1 \nHof does not lead a healthy lifestyle and does not optimize his diet or other healthy lifestyle strategies, which makes these accomplishments even more impressive. Please understand this interview is not an endorsement of Hof's lifestyle. \nHof, perhaps better known as \"The Iceman,\" has gained a fair amount of notoriety for his ability to withstand extreme cold \u2014 an ability he attributes to a specific set of techniques involving breath work and extreme temperature conditioning. Conquering Mount Kilimanjaro \nCarney was initially hired by Playboy Magazine to investigate Hof, but wound up embracing this program, and actually climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa, wearing nothing but shoes and shorts, going shirtless most of the way. \nHe also completed the climb in 28 hours, which is very fast. It usually takes five to 10 days to get to the top, as you need to acclimatize to the altitude. Altitude sickness occurs when your blood oxygen level gets so low that you start having headaches. \nAs it progresses it can turn into hypobaric hypoxia, which leads to swollen limbs, cardiac arrest and pulmonary embolism. Ninety percent of people who attempt the summit get some version of altitude sickness. \nCarney's training allowed him to make the climb without acclimatization, which is nearly unheard of. \n\"The U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine, which is the environmental unit for the U.S. army, has really advanced tables for high altitude ascents. They predicted about 70 percent [of the group] would come down with acute mountain sickness \u2026 \nInstead, 93 percent of us made it up to the top. The first group, where I was, did it in 28 hours, which was incredibly fast. When we asked the Dutch Mountaineering Association what our success rate would be, they predicted a 100 percent fatality rate,\" Carney says . From Skeptic to Believer \nThat's a powerful testimony to the physiological benefits of the strategies Hof teaches. Ironically, Carney actually approached Hof as a skeptic, intent on debunking his methods. He thought Hof may be harming people with his advice. Carney explains: \n\"I'm an investigative journalist. Over the course of my career, I have examined a lot of false gurus, people who make really advanced spiritual claims and occasionally end with people dying, getting hurt, losing all their money \u2014 that sort of thing \u2026 \nWhen I heard about Wim Hof, I thought he was going to be another very sketchy guru \u2026 because his claims were that he could control his body temperature at will, consciously control his autonomic nervous system and his immune system \u2026 \nHe has the record for an Arctic marathon, barefoot in his shorts. He's done marathons in the Sahara. He's hiked two-thirds of the way to Mount Everest, also in his shorts. I knew he had some of these abilities \u2026 \nHowever, what I worried about was that he was capitalizing on innate biological abilities, and made false claims that they were teachable. I worried he could get someone killed.\" \nCarney met Hof in Wroclaw, Poland, in the middle of the winter, and Hof confidently stated that, within a few days, Carney would be standing outside in the snow wearing nothing but his shorts, feeling comfortable and warm. \n\"I thought that was sort of crazy,\" Carney says. \"But as an anthropologist, as an investigative journalist \u2026 I can't just go there and write him off full stop without giving him a chance.\" As it turned out, Carney became an enthusiastic convert. Tapping the Human Potential \nThe first thing Hof teaches is a breathing method that involves intermittent deep breathing and breath-holding after the final out-breath. In short order, Carney, who could normally hold his breath for about 30 seconds, was able to hold his breath for two minutes without air in his lungs. \nAnother breathing method involves intermittent hyperventilating, followed by a breath-hold after the final out-breath while you do pushups. \nSuddenly, Carney's ability to do pushups doubled \u2014 from 20 pushups to 40, all in a matter of 15 minutes' worth of breath training. Carney describes the rest of his remarkable journey: \n\"I thought, wow, Wim has figured out something about the body that is really, really interesting [so] \u2026 I said, 'OK. I'm going to give his whole shirtless [in the] snow thing a chance.' I stripped off all my clothes. Basically, I'm in my underwear. \nI walk out and I put my feet in the snow for the first time. He's like, 'You're going to stay out here for five minutes.' I'll tell you what. It hurt. We're probably talking 25 [degrees] F \u2026 I put my feet in the snow and it felt like walking over hot coals. \nWhat's happening there is you're triggering this response in your body called vasoconstriction where the arteries in your feet will [close] to push the blood to the core \u2026 In five minutes, it was super painful. Then we jumped into a sauna right after that. \nThe process of vasodilation, which is where your arteries open up, that hurt even more. I was like, 'Wim, this is a terrible method. Why are you teaching this?' He's like, 'Yeah. Of course, it's going to hurt. You've never done this before. But just wait until tomorrow' \u2026 \nThe next day, I was standing out in the snow and that feeling of panic and pain didn't set in for 10 minutes, which is like doubling my resistance in [one day]. We just kept on doing this for a week. We're jumping in cold water. We're rolling in snow \u2026 \nBy the end of the week, I'm standing in the snow in my shorts, sweating in this Polish winter. I'm there for an hour and there's no problem. At the end of that journey with him, I hike up a mountain in Poland, again, wearing just shorts in the middle of the blowing winter. \nWe're talking about 2 [degrees] F. I'm on the mountain for eight hours and I just sweat the whole time. I knew that whatever Wim was doing, it worked \u2026 I had to reevaluate what I thought about these sorts of gurus who have these ideas that seem so impossible. \nI realized Wim wasn't offering superpowers. He was offering human powers \u2026 Humans have an innate ability to adapt to the environment around us. All he was doing was giving me a method to learn how to control some of these processes in my body.\" By Avoiding Temperature Extremes, You Forgo Health Benefits \nOne of the primary premises in Carney's book is that our technological sophistication, which allows us to live in a very climate-controlled situation within a narrow comfort range, impacts our health in surprising ways. For most people alive today, climate-controlled comfort has been the experience throughout our life, and we have no reason to believe that exposure to harsh conditions might be beneficial. \nBut, according to Carney, the evidence suggests the human body actually needs those extreme temperature variations. We evolved to develop resilience and health through those changes. For example, vasoconstriction and vasodilation help optimize the function of your circulatory system by strengthening all those smooth muscles that allow constriction and dilation to occur. \n\"What this means is that we have all of these muscles in our circulatory system that just aren't getting exercise \u2026 [T]hat guy with the gym body \u2026 may look physically healthy, but actually [may] have a fairly degraded arterial system, just because he hasn't stimulated it. We need this external stimulation to live a full human life and really use all of our biology. \nThere are serious autoimmune impacts with this \u2014 treatments for diabetes, obesity and all of these things that are important because we used to think that human health relied on diet and exercise \u2026 But what this book uncovers \u2026 [is] that there's actually a third pillar. The third pillar is the environment \u2026 If you ignore it, you're not doing your biology any favors.\" Why Cold Thermogenesis Improves Health \nOne of the mechanisms by which cold exposure or cold thermogenesis aids weight loss and reduces your risk of diabetes and other chronic disease is by inducing brown and beige adipose tissue (BAT), which is incredibly mitochondrial-dense and helps improve mitochondrial function. One of the physiological functions of body fat is to be used as fuel to heat your body if you have active BAT metabolism. \nBy regularly exposing yourself to cold, you build up a mitochondria-rich tissue very similar to brown fat called beige fat. Beige fat is recruited through your white fat, which can then be used to heat your body and maintain a more active-passive metabolism. Indeed, the conclusion I reached after many decades of studying health is that burning fat as your primary fuel is the goal. \nThere are a number of ways to reach this goal. You can do it through diet, and in my new book, \" Fat for Fuel ,\" I explain how to do that. But there's also a tremendous synergy with cold thermogenesis. \n\"Western civilization has given us this enticing option of being comfortable all the time. We just think, because we're so technologically advanced, that comfort should be available at the flip of a switch. But that's actually undermining who we are as people and leading to things like obesity, weak circulatory systems and \u2026 autoimmune diseases,\" Carney says. \nThe good news is, we all have this latent capacity that we can tap into and relearn. It went underground, so to speak, but it didn't disappear. Carney developed remarkable endurance to cold in a single week. He also lost seven pounds of fat in that same time. Getting Started at Home \nA simple way to improve your BAT metabolism is taking cold showers . The initial tensing is part of your body's attempts to heat itself back up. Try to suppress this initial instinct and relax instead. As noted by Carney, \"What you're doing is telling your body, 'OK. We're not going to do the easy method, which is use our muscles to heat ourselves. We're going to turn on our metabolism.'\" \nA more effective strategy would be to swim in cold water, which may be a relatively easy strategy for many to implement during winter months. You want to start slowly around 70 degrees or so and gradually work your way down to the 40s. It is not necessary to swim in ice water. \nI tried this last year and was amazed that initially 62-degree water would cause me to shiver but after sticking with it for a few weeks to months I could comfortably swim in mid-40-degree water. My only problem is that my ears would get cold. \nHow long it takes to build up BAT is still unknown. But we do know that BAT is generally a seasonal tissue. In the winter, your body generates more of it. In the summer, you have less. A primary issue is, how often do you activate it? Without environmental stimuli, your body will not create this metabolically or energy-rich tissue, as there's no reason for it to do so. \n\"Maintaining it by taking cold showers, ice baths or just giving variation in your routines is very important if you want to have these abilities. How long does it last if you don't do it? I don't know and I don't want to find out personally. I am pretty excited about having it and having these abilities, and it's not very difficult to maintain,\" Carney says. \nIn addition to ice baths, you could simply turn down the thermostat in your house in the winter to about 60 degrees F. Jumping into cool or cold water after heating up in the sauna is another strategy I've been using. Exercising in cold weather wearing few articles of clothing is yet another strategy. As noted by Carney, \"What you're doing is you're giving all of these signals to the nerves on your skin to say, 'Hey, it's winter. Now, let's start generating BAT,' because that's what your body does.\" Breathing Methods Speed Up the Process \nCarney recommends incorporating Hof's breathing methods as well, although it's worth noting that this is not for everyone. Since it involves hyperventilation, people with anxiety or who are prone to panic attacks would be wise to make sure you're learning such breathing techniques from a competent teacher who can address any psychological reactions that may crop up. \nBreath holds are also not good for everyone, and may be unhealthy if done recklessly. Breath retention practices taught in yoga, for example, are done in a very careful and calculated way, and for good reason. If you want to try it, be sure you understand the instructions, start off slow, and build your ability over time. It's important to understand that hyperventilation can cause adverse psychological effects, and could make you pass out. So, please, act responsibly and practice safely. \nAlso, never, under any circumstance, perform breath-hold exercises under water, as you may black out and drown. There are in fact reports of people dying from this kind of practice, so always be mindful of your safety, and make sure you have a spotter \u2014 someone who can help you should you get light-headed or dizzy. \nWith those warnings in place, the breathing method Carney recommends can be briefly described as follows: First, you take 30 to 40 deep controlled breaths. This will decrease the carbon dioxide (CO2) in your system and increase your oxygen (O2) saturation up to 100 percent. Next, after a complete out-breath where you've emptied your lungs as completely as possible, you then hold your breath until you get to that point where you need to gasp for air. \n\"By doing that, you're interacting with an autonomic system in your body, which is where the gasp reflex is. You're telling your body that you should have some control over this system,\" Carney explains. \"It's the same thing that you do in a cold shower when you're telling yourself not to shiver. It's the same skill of becoming mentally strong over an autonomic reflex. \nThese two methods work on different systems, parasympathetic and sympathetic systems, in the body. What that does is give you more resistance in the cold and has this autonomic trick, this autonomic ability to influence your immune system down the road, which is incredibly useful.\" \nUnfortunately, Hof neglects to mention the many others that have adopted these techniques prior to his popularizing them. There's a similar type of breathing called holotropic breathing, developed by Dr. Stan Grof. Hof also teaches another method called DMT breathing, which is virtually indistinguishable from holotropic breathing. Yogic breathing or pranayama is another similar technique, as is the Tibetan breathing technique called Tummo, which allows you to consciously control your body temperature. \nBrazilian Jiu Jitsu legend Rickson Gracie also uses yogic breathing for cold resistance and mental strength. Ice bathing, sauna and the combination of the two also have a long history and tradition in Russia and Scandinavian countries. So, what Hof is teaching is nothing new. Many of these techniques have been around for a long time. What makes Hof particularly interesting is his openness to investigation and testing, giving us a deeper insight into our human potential. Implications for Autoimmune Diseases \nThis kind of extreme environmental conditioning and breath work also has an impact on your immune system. Hof claimed he could consciously control his immune function, which at that point was defined as impossible by science. A Dutch immunologist named Peter Pickkers, who's renowned for developing a clinical test to evaluate   immunosuppressive drugs, decided to investigate Hof's remarkable claim. \nHof claimed he could suppress his immune system, effectively making his own mind do the work of an immunosuppressive drug. The test Pickkers developed is called the \"endotoxin test\", which is essentially injecting E. coli bacteria that have been killed in a laboratory to see if the immune system responds. Normally, when you're injected with this bacterium, you will have an immediate primary immune response. If the immunosuppressive drug works well, then you won't have those symptoms. \nHof was injected with this endotoxin and using nothing but his breathing method, he had no response other than a minor headache. \"This was a really big response because it had never been shown in a clinical setting that you could do this,\" Carney says. Tests confirmed his blood was indeed resistant to endotoxin. Even after blood had been removed from his body and placed in a container for six days, it continued to be resistant. \n\"This was a very interesting study. The medical community said, 'Well maybe it's just because Wim is a freak,' which is a totally good point to make \u2026 [So] the next year \u2026 he took 12 volunteers from Holland and brought them to Poland to give them the exact same training that I got \u2026 took them back to the Netherlands [and] injected all of them with the same endotoxin. All of them repeated the same results. \nThis was published in a very prestigious journal called the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . It's a huge study. Because if \u2026 you can consciously suppress your immune system, this has potential impact for every autoimmune illness out there \u2026 anything where your body is attacking itself. \nThink arthritis, lupus, Crohn's disease. To some degree, diabetes [and] Parkinson's. All of a sudden, all of these people are starting to use the Wim Hof method to treat themselves for a huge variety of autoimmune illnesses. \nIn the book, I look at four case studies of four different people who are using cold showers and conscious breathing to combat and reverse, in some cases, Crohn's disease, arthritis and Parkinson's. There are amazing anecdotes. This is not a totally randomized, placebo controlled study that ha[s] gone on for 15 years, but they're great leading edge results and they are real people. I've seen them myself,\" Carney says. Notes on Safety \nI would be remiss were I not to mention the importance of training within your limits, ideally with a qualified trainer, should you embark on more extreme temperature and breathing challenges. The reason for this is because there are risks involved. \nWhen exposing yourself to extreme cold, you have to be mindful not to stay cold too long, as hypothermia is a very real concern. Additionally, rapidly heating the body when hypothermic, or near hypothermic can be very dangerous. In fact, it can be lethal. Carney explains: \n\"It's called the afterdrop. It's actually a potentially dangerous situation. Like if somebody's stuck under the ice in a lake and has hypothermia, you don't want to warm them up quickly by putting them in a warm shower. This is because vasoconstriction constricts all of the blood to your core to keep you alive and warm. \nThen when you warm up, there's the opposite, which is vasodilation, where it opens up and recirculates that warm blood through the limbs. But if your limbs are very, very cold already because you're hypothermic \u2026 the warm blood in your core will circulate to your cold limbs and then return cold blood back to your core. Your core temperature will drop precipitously. \nIf you find somebody who's actually in dangerous hypothermia, if you warm them up too quickly, their core temperature will drop and they'll die. They'll have a cardiac arrest. While doing these trainings, you do risk, to some degree, having a minor level of that afterdrop, especially when you're first starting out, before you're really teaching your metabolism to deal with this. \nOne thing you can do to combat afterdrop, as long as you're not too [close to] hypothermia \u2014 which you should never [be] because you should always be practicing within your limits \u2014 but you can do an exercise, such as pushups, such as running \u2026 Use your muscle movements to bring your core temperature up. That will do it safer.\" More Information \nIf you're intrigued by the possibilities presented here, pick up a copy of \" What Doesn't Kill Us .\" \"Just give it a chance \u2026 Even if you don't read the book, try a cold shower. That's the base. That's the total minimum. If you do want to examine the book, it's on Amazon. It's on Audible \u2026 I've been so happy that I've affected so many people's lives so far. That's awesome,\" Carney says. You can also find out more about him at scottcarney.com \nI believe it has the potential to help many. This kind of environmental conditioning \u2014 heat and cold stress \u2014 is a really powerful health principle that very few clinicians appreciate, but it has many important metabolic benefits. I heartily endorse and personally embrace and practice it. 0", "crawled": "2017-04-16T08:51:06.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-16T08:51:06.000+03:00", "uuid": "4522a2cd14f87c03cdb2e858a159004399bcadbb", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 951, "likes": 951}, "gplus": {"shares": 22}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 38}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 28}}, "country": "US", "site": "mercola.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://articles.mercola.com/sites/mainfeed.aspx", "uuid": "4522a2cd14f87c03cdb2e858a159004399bcadbb", "section_title": "", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 9, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TGjdAmMHRYy3CsFsKLeQ0swog87e7lhVHw0i0SbxAW9_s4Wqxjbh9RzasI.T5sCvdMcWWBcsCGECp4Ydb6DTY9ckeYclMNJBa0JHUocm5xfsxs6RuVl0VR", "domain_rank": 2440, "main_image": "https://media.mercola.com/ImageServer/Public/2017/April/how-environmental-conditioning-can-transform-health-fb.jpg", "site_full": "articles.mercola.com", "title_full": "How Environmental Conditioning Helps You Tap Into Your Evolutionary Strengths", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "How Environmental Conditioning Helps You Tap Into Your Evolutionary Strengths", "published": "2017-04-16T08:51:06.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "wroclaw"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "netherlands"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "u.s."}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "africa"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "poland"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "mount kilimanjaro"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "mount everest"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "amazon"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "sahara"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "russia"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "holland"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "wim hof"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "crohn"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kilimanjaro  carney"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "jiu jitsu"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "rickson gracie"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "wim"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "stan grof"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "scott carney"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "hof"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "peter pickkers"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "carney"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "national academy of sciences"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dutch mountaineering association"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "u.s. army research institute of environmental medicine"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "playboy magazine"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/rPCDLkAl21TGjdAmMHRYy3CsFsKLeQ0swog87e7lhVHw0i0SbxAW9_s4Wqxjbh9RzasI.T5sCvdMcWWBcsCGECp4Ydb6DTY9ckeYclMNJBa0JHUocm5xfsxs6RuVl0VR", "author": "Dr. Mercola", "external_links": [], "title": "How Environmental Conditioning Helps You Tap Into Your Evolutionary Strengths", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Recipe From Jennafer Ashley of PaleoHacks \nDate Published: March 28, 2017 42,273 Views 0 \nGet your FREE COOKBOOK and Receive My Free Natural Health Newsletter! \nWhen it comes to traditional and timeless desserts, one of the most loved choices that many people appreciate is vanilla custard. Creamy and sweet, this classic culinary treat is made by gently heating a mixture of eggs and cream until it reaches the desired thickness. 1 \nCustard has been around since the Middle Ages, and was first used as a filling for tarts and pies. Today, it\u2019s incorporated in various desserts, such as eclairs and trifles, or served by itself. There\u2019s even a National Vanilla Custard Day, which falls on August 17, to celebrate this elegant but mouthwatering dessert. 2 \nMost custard recipes today, however, often don\u2019t skimp on the sweet ingredients, meaning you\u2019re unknowingly consuming high amounts of sugar with every bite. Ready-to-eat versions also use pasteurized milk which, as I\u2019ve discussed before, can spell trouble for your health. \nIf you\u2019re looking for a healthy option, this Succulent Vanilla Chia Custard recipe created by Jennafer Ashley from Paleohacks is a wonderful and wholesome choice. Not only does it use coconut milk in place of cow\u2019s milk (making it tolerable for lactose-intolerant people), but it also blends in chia seeds , a delicious source of dietary fiber, protein, healthy fats and more. \nWhether as a palate cleanser after a filling meal or as a quick snack that will get you through the rest of the day, this easy custard recipe is a sure winner. Succulent Vanilla Chia Custard Recipe Preparation Time: 15 minutes Cooking Time: 15 minutes Ingredients 13 1/2 ounces full-fat coconut milk 2 Tbsp. chia seeds 2 Tbsp. Dr. Mercola\u2019s raw honey 1/2 tsp. vanilla bean powder or Dr. Mercola\u2019s vanilla extract Serving Size: 2 Procedure Pour coconut milk and honey into a saucepan and heat over medium heat. Pour eggs into a heat-resistant bowl. When milk-honey mixture is steaming hot, slowly pour over eggs and vigorously whisk. Return egg mixture to saucepan and continue whisking. Whisk in vanilla bean powder. Reduce heat to low and continue to heat but do not boil, whisking regularly. Once custard has thickened, about 10 minutes, remove from heat and cool for 5 minutes. Stir in chia seeds and divide custard among 2 jars. Chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour. Succulent, (Mildly) Sweet and Satisfying: This Chia Custard Recipe Has Got You Covered \nThe simplicity of this custard recipe makes it perfect for people who want a quick and easy dish to cap off a delicious meal. However, the timing and the temperature you use are essential to get a flawless end product. \nCustard should be cooked at the right pace, using a low temperature. Cooking custard too quickly by using a temperature that\u2019s too high will make the egg proteins curdle, giving you something that resembles scrambled eggs, and not the smooth treat you\u2019re after. The Spruce 3 even advises using indirect heat, such as by putting the mixture in a double-broiler (just like melting chocolate or making hollandaise sauce), to get the perfect texture you want. \nAs equally important as the cooking method are the ingredients you will use to make this dessert. Remember that the quality of your raw ingredients can greatly affect the nutritional content of any dish. Just take a look at the wholesome ingredients used for this recipe: Pastured egg yolks \u2014 Egg yolks have been unfairly vilified for decades because they contain cholesterol and saturated fat, and are believed to contribute to high cholesterol levels and heart disease. But did you know that the yolk is actually more nutrient dense compared to egg whites? Egg yolk contains omega-3 fats , vitamins A, E, D and K, and higher levels of vitamin B12, folate and choline. It\u2019s also where all the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin are found. If you\u2019re still afraid that eating egg yolks can damage your health, take a look at this recent study published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition: Even carriers of ApoE4 gene, which make them susceptible to heart disease, egg and cholesterol intake were not found to increase the risk of coronary artery disease. 4 Plus, a separate research found that dietary cholesterol from eggs actually contributed to an increase in beneficial HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol. 5 When buying eggs, make sure that you buy only true free-range, pastured eggs from a local farmer or health food store. Look for egg yolks with a bright orange color, as pale yellow yolks are an indication that the eggs are raised in factory farms. Chia seeds \u2014 Consuming just 2 tablespoons of chia seeds can give you 50 percent of the daily recommended value for manganese, 24 percent of magnesium and 18 percent of calcium \u2014 three minerals that are essential for bone health, energy metabolism, DNA synthesis and healthy weight management. Two tablespoons of chia seeds also equal 10 grams of fiber, which is definitely a boon to your health, as fiber can help reduce your risk of a number of chronic diseases, including diabetes and stroke. Chia seeds are also one of the most cost-efficient foods you can buy because they do not go bad for a long time. They can actually last up to two years with no refrigeration, mainly because of their high antioxidant levels. A word of caution when eating chia seeds: if you have dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), do not eat dry chia seeds. When mixed with liquids, the seeds can form a gel-like ball that can block your esophagus and may need medical treatment to be removed.Thus, blending it in a recipe like this before eating is a wonderful alternative to eating them by themselves. Coconut milk \u2014 Produced by expressing the juice of grated coconut meat and blending it with water, coconut milk is becoming popular among vegan communities today because it can work as a great dairy alternative. It also doesn\u2019t hold back in terms of nutritional value \u2014 it\u2019s actually rich in antioxidants, vitamins C, E and B, potassium, magnesium, iron and phosphorus. But what makes coconut milk so wonderful is its high amounts of healthy fats. Coconut milk contains lauric acid, a medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA), which is not only converted to energy (and not as fat), but is also transformed into monolaurin in your body. This monoglyceride can actually eliminate lipid-coated viruses such as HIV and herpes , measles , gram-negative bacteria, influenza and protozoa such as Giardia lamblia. Vanilla bean powder \u2014 Made from dried and powdered vanilla beans, but without any additional sugar or alcohol, this powder gives this dessert the pleasing aroma and sweet taste that makes it so popular.In addition, vanilla also offers benefits to your health, mainly through vanillin, its chief chemical component. Vanillin has been linked to lower bad cholesterol levels and improved symptoms of gout, arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. Fresh vanilla beans also provide small traces of iron, manganese, potassium, magnesium and zinc, as well as antioxidants that can help prevent tissue and cell breakdown. 6 , 7 \nFinally, this recipe uses raw honey, a natural sweetener with many health benefits, in place of fructose or sugar. But even though it offers boons to your health, honey should be consumed in moderation because it can exacerbate pre-existing insulin resistance and wreak havoc on your body in excessive amounts. If you have insulin resistance, you should scrap honey from the ingredients list. \nAbout the Blog \nPaleohacks is one of the largest Paleo communities on the web.

Everything overwhelmed me: my marriage, my kids, the rotting-out windows of my house, the dog barking every time the delivery guy came to the door, and not least of all, our nation\u2019s mind-boggling political reality. This overwhelm came out in startling bursts of anger and quiet bouts of sobbing. Caffeine, my hyperactive schedule, and surges of productive-anxiety kept me going. Staying positive and present in my everyday life was a challenge. \nI knew I needed to make a change. I considered acupuncture, weekly foot massages, and even a cleanse , although banning all my favorite food groups from my life seemed downright masochistic. After consulting with various friends and overhearing the barista at Starbucks describe her miraculous transformation from the queen of stress to the goddess of chill, I decided to give meditation a try. In 2012, nearly 18 million adults in the United States used meditation, according to a report by the National Center for Health Statistics . I was ready to join the party. \nMeditation sounded like the best thing since Amazon Prime , but I\u2019m a bit of a skeptic, so I did my research. Guided meditation, at least to start, is recommended. The best time to meditate seems to be first thing in the morning. Benefits include increased relaxation and focus, decreased stress and anxiety, improved perception and memory, and even slowing of the aging process. All I had to do was find a quiet place to sit, close my eyes, and breathe deeply. Oh, and I had to spend time meditating every day for it to work effectively. Wait, what? What if I missed a day or two? Who knew what could prevent me from my daily lotus? The 5-year-old could get the stomach flu. I could get the stomach flu. \nCould it be that meditation \u2014 the mere idea of it \u2014 was making me anxious? I refused to quit meditating before I even started. I banished my worries to a teeny tiny corner of my brain and downloaded a meditation app, one narrated by a particularly pleasant sounding British guy named Andy. The next morning, resolved and ready, I woke early before the other four people in my house, settled into my favorite chair and gave myself over to Andy for 10 of the longest minutes of my life. \nAndy assured me meditating would feel easy some days and hard on others. Honestly, I\u2019m not entirely sure what all he said because I was totally distracted by his soothing accent and only half awake because I hadn\u2019t had my coffee yet. What good was this going to be without coffee?! Never mind. I breathed in and out, in and out, just like Andy told me to. \nThen the neighbor\u2019s dog started barking, which meant my dog was about to start barking. I tried ignoring it, but then Andy told me to pay attention to the sounds around me. Okay, fine, I paid attention, but that made my heart rate spike because that damn dog out there was about to trigger a howling match which meant my kindergartner was sure to pop out of her bed and bust into my so-called circle of Zen. I spent the remaining seven minutes of the session listening for the 5-year-old, wondering if I had enough sandwich bread for three school lunches and antsy to make my next haircut appointment before my stylist\u2019s calendar filled up. \nClearly, this first day was one of the hard ones. I stuck with it though, dutifully rolling out of bed and trudging sleepily to my chair to sit and breathe. I wish I could say it totally worked, that after almost two months of meditating for ten minutes a day, I was a happier, calmer, more productive person, but that\u2019s not exactly how it went down. \nDuring the silent minutes of my meditation sessions, I might start out visualizing my body filling up with liquid gold until a shining light of loving kindness shot out of my head, but my thoughts would always drift into super-stressful territory. Soon I\u2019d be retracing all the possible escape routes from our house were it burning, imagining what I\u2019d do if an earthquake hit while I was driving across the Bay Bridge (we live in Oakland), and on Tuesday mornings, desperately fighting the urge to look out the window to see if my husband remembered to take out the trash bins. \nAndy told me to notice how my brain wandered, concentrate on my breathing, and gently bring my thoughts back to the here and now. The problem was, the more I cleared my head of the top-level clutter, the more room I made for my deeper worries to shimmy out of the shadows. In my non-meditating hours, I often felt more anxious than ever, yet entirely unmotivated to do anything about it. I gained 4 pounds. I forgot to pay the bills. I could barely keep my eyes open past 8 p.m. I missed my anxiety-driven motivation. At least then I got shit done. \nMy family will tell you that I was nicer, as in, I wasn\u2019t yelling as much, and maybe that\u2019s true, but I wouldn\u2019t say I was happier. Not being pissed all the time was an improvement, but I didn\u2019t feel like myself. I felt detached. I couldn\u2019t quite shake the stressful thoughts that surfaced while meditating, including the idea that I wasn\u2019t doing this meditation thing right. \nEight weeks into my meditation journey, I stopped. It\u2019s totally possible that I might go back to it at some point when I\u2019m ready. Until then, I\u2019ll keep practicing the one takeaway that stuck with me because shooting bolts of liquid-gold loving-kindness at all the assholes who cut me off on the road really does feel better than cussing them out.", "crawled": "2017-04-16T07:38:03.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-16T07:38:03.000+03:00", "uuid": "5e50542840ebbaceb59ca66a5e629891f8b100ff", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 578, "likes": 578}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}}, "country": "US", "site": "scarymommy.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.scarymommy.com/feed/", "uuid": "5e50542840ebbaceb59ca66a5e629891f8b100ff", "section_title": "Scary Mommy", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 5, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8C1Q610nHYYevCfzN9JDN6QbygRC458x_caQZAuIuob5z4PFM6tCVWLml0vCHEiuYfRBh0PPfEoGH2FVewt_WX", "domain_rank": 10926, "main_image": "http://www.scarymommy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/meditation.jpg", "site_full": "www.scarymommy.com", "title_full": "I Can\u2019t Meditate Because Meditation Stresses Me Out", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "I Can\u2019t Meditate Because Meditation Stresses Me Out", "published": "2017-04-16T07:38:03.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8C1Q610nHYYevCfzN9JDN6QbygRC458x_caQZAuIuob5z4PFM6tCVWLml0vCHEiuYfRBh0PPfEoGH2FVewt_WX", "author": "Lisa Sadikman", "external_links": [], "title": "I Can\u2019t Meditate Because Meditation Stresses Me Out", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Toni Hammer Apr 15, 2017 \nIt was 9pm and the 700 th time my daughter had snuck out of bed. With an exasperated sigh I tried my best to be calm when I asked her why she was still awake. \n\u201cI just can\u2019t sleep, Mom,\u201d she said, \u201cI just keep worrying about school tomorrow.\u201d \nThe words covered my heart with fear because I\u2019ve been there often. Tossing and turning and trying to sleep without success because I\u2019ve been overly concerned about the next day or week or year. Her words were familiar to me because I live with anxiety and suddenly I was face to face with the possibility that my daughter may have some of that in her genes, too. \nWe cuddled and talked it through for a few minutes until she was either tired, or just tired of hearing me talk, and she went back to bed to finally fall asleep. I, on the other hand, ironically felt myself unable to follow suit. \nIn the following days I listened to her when she talked. Really listened. I heard the familiar phrases that crowded my brain. I\u2019m worried, I\u2019m scared, what if . It\u2019s the what if that struck me because that\u2019s what anxiety is, isn\u2019t it? Just a string of \u201cwhat if\u201d thoughts that you can\u2019t seem to control. \nIt saddens and pains me that my daughter may grow up to struggle with anxiety like I do. I know the fear that I live with constantly and that type of inner turmoil and torture isn\u2019t something I\u2019d wish on my worst enemy, let alone my own flesh and blood. I want my daughter to be the carefree five-year-old she is. I want her to look at the world with excitement about the possibilities in her life, not trepidation about what might or might not happen to her. I want her to be fearless in her endeavors, to be brave, not worried and scared. \nWhile I could pull my knees into my chest and rock in a corner, lamenting over the possibility that somehow her anxiety is my fault, I choose instead to be grateful that I live with anxiety. I know it sounds weird to be happy about less than stellar mental health, but I sincerely believe my own anxiety may be a blessing in disguise. \nSince I have it, and I am on the path to learn how to cope with it on a daily basis, I have the knowledge needed to aid my daughter in overcoming her own anxious thoughts. I can teach her the things that I have learned to help combat the constant worry. She can learn these techniques at an early age instead of in her 30s so that instead of being plagued by it for years before finally getting help, she can start implementing these coping mechanisms now. By the time she is older, she will hopefully know what to do before it becomes debilitating. \nMy seeing her symptoms of anxiety have also opened up a line of communication between us about the medication I take for it. When she used to ask why I was taking a pill in the afternoon, I would just brush it off with a blas\u00e9 \u201cthese pills help mommy not worry.\u201d Now I can explain to her what the medications actually do. I explain to her that sometimes Mommy needs a little help so she can calm down, so she can enjoy her day more . I explain to her that some people need a little help like talking to people or taking medicine to help them be the best version of themselves she can be. She is growing up learning that there should be no stigma in asking for help or taking medication. In today\u2019s society where so many of us are deemed less than because we take medication for our mental illness, that lesson I can teach her is a true gift. \nWhile I hope and pray every night that this is just a phase, that she doesn\u2019t really have anxiety and instead is just working out her emotions, I\u2019m at least at peace with the possibility, and I\u2018m proud of myself for preparing her for what may come in her future. Whether she has anxiety or not I know she will be just fine because she\u2019s a fighter.

POTS is a condition characterized by too little blood returning to the heart when moving from a lying down to a standing up position. Symptoms can include fainting , dizziness , or lightheadedness when standing up from a reclining position. The reduced blood flow to the heart causes the heart rate to increase (tachycardia). About 70%-80% of people affected by POTS are women between the ages of 15 and 50. The cause of POTS is poorly understood. Symptoms often begin after major surgery, trauma , or a viral illness. Some women may develop the condition after pregnancy , or the symptoms may worsen before the menstrual period . Treatment involves relieving low blood volume or regulating any circulatory problems. There is not one single treatment that has been found to be effective for all patients. Sometimes, changes like adding extra salt to the diet and maintaining adequate fluid intake are often effective for symptom relief. What is postural tachycardia syndrome? Share Your Story \nPostural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is one of a group of disorders that have orthostatic intolerance (OI) as their primary symptom. OI describes a condition in which an excessively reduced volume of blood returns to the heart after an individual stands up from a lying down position. Who gets POT syndrome? \nAnyone at any age can develop POTS, but the majority of individuals affected (between 75 and 80 percent) are women between the ages of 15 to 50 years of age. \nSome women report an increase in episodes of POTS right before their menstrual periods. POTS often begins after a pregnancy, major surgery, trauma, or a viral illness. It may make individuals unable to exercise because the activity brings on fainting spells or dizziness . What causes POT syndrome? \nDoctors aren't sure yet what causes the reduced return of blood to the heart that occurs in OI, or why the heart begins to beat so rapidly in POTS. Current thinking is that there are a number of mechanisms. Some patients have peripheral denervation (neuropathic POTS); some have symptoms that are due to sustained or parosyxmal overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system (hyperadrenergic POTS); and some individuals have PTOS dominated by features of deconditioning. What are the signs and symptoms of POT syndrome? \nThe primary symptom of OI is lightheadedness or fainting. In POTS, the lightheadedness or fainting is also accompanied by a rapid increase in heartbeat of more than 30 beats per minute, or a heart rate that exceeds 120 beats per minute, within 10 minutes of rising. The faintness or lightheadedness of POTS are relieved by lying down again.

There was no financial circumstance that mandated the change. Rather, she decided that having fewer things reduced her responsibility to care for them thereby gaining more time. \nHer attitude towards living a more simplified life sadly sounded silly to me at time. Today I\u2019m embracing the concept. Instead of buying a larger house like the rest of my peers, our family has opted for a smaller one. My friend\u2019s courage to buck the American culture of \u201cmore is better\u201d is now inspirational. \nIn a few weeks, we literally eliminated several roomfuls of furniture, donated over a dozen van loads of stuff, and tossed countless bins of trash. It has been a freeing experience with many benefits achieved from having less. Here are a few of them. Less stuff equals less responsibility. Things demand proper maintenance. The more things that exist, the more that needs to be cared for. Eliminating things allows people to better manage what they do have. Happiness is not about more things. At the heart of collecting possessions is a belief that more things mean greater happiness. But happiness can be achieved regardless of circumstances or possessions. Using things to gain more satisfaction puts pressure on an inanimate object instead of looking inward. Purging stuff is cleansing. Each item should be evaluated for its\u2019 future use and benefit. Keeping things \u201cjust in case\u201d or \u201cjust because\u201d demands that the item be utilized in the future in some manner. This expectation places pressure on future decisions. Eliminating the item frees the expectation. What remains is valued. After all of the unnecessary stuff is gone, the items left behind can be treasured. These selected items have meaning from the past as well as a purpose for the future. They are less likely to go to waste. Life feels more simple. When life is simplified it is easier to get back to what matters most. There are fewer choices and fewer demands which actually means there is more time. More time in turn allows a person to do what is important to them rather than what is being demanded. More focus on relationships. Strangely enough, the fewer things that are around, the more time that can be given to relationships. If the relationships in life are what matters most, consider abandoning the responsibility of stuff in exchange. The shift is worth the effort. Begin with the end in mind. At the end of a life, most people don\u2019t wish they had more things or worked longer hours. Rather, they wish for more time to do the things they enjoyed. It is far easier to focus on enjoyable activities when there are fewer things to manage. \nThis concept of less is not for everyone. Some cultures and religions value having less. But clearly within the American culture, there are far more people who believe that the more things we own, the better. Going against the curve might be difficult to explain but is so worth the effort. \n\nChristine Hammond is a Licensed Mental Health Counselor and a National Certified Counselor who lives in Orlando and is the award-winning author of The Exhausted Woman\u2019s Handbook. \nLast reviewed: By John M.

This article will walk you through the process of cultivating beets correctly so that you have an endless supply of this delicious plant. \n  \nTake note of these steps when planting beets indoors . Ready the container \u2013 Beets can be grown in both pots or plastic containers that are at least 17 inches deep. Set up the containers by drilling holes in the base if none is present. Next, put something that would catch water that drains from the holes. This could be the container\u2019s lid or a plastic sheet. Planting the seeds \u2013 It is important to note that beets do not thrive well in a crowded space. Beets that grow in a crowded area tend to be ill-formed; this is why space is a vital element in planting the seed. Typically, beet seeds are placed about a 1/4-inch deep in the soil at about a foot apart. Cultivating the plant \u2013 The seeds need a lot of sunlight to grow, so place your plant near a window or any place exposed to sunlight . Beet seeds germinate in 17 days and grow best in cooler temperatures and uniform moisture. The plant requires very little watering, at only about one inch of water per week. Harvesting \u2013 While beets can grow to baseball size, it is best to harvest them when they are between the sizes of a golf ball or tennis ball. \nThinking of growing them in a garden ? Take note of these tips. Soil \u2013 The plant requires a well-prepared, rich, moist soil. Beet seeds prefer a phosphorus-rich soil to germinate. Amend the soil with aged manure, and ensure that the soil\u2019s temperature reaches 50 degrees Fahrenheit before planting the seeds. Planting \u2013 Plant the seeds at about half an inch in to the soil. Beets can also be grown in plug trays before transplanting directly into garden. Transplant pre-grown seedlings eight to 10 inches apart. There is no need to till or thin them as they will push themselves away from each other once they develop. It is ideal to plant the seeds as early crops between March and April, and as late crops between June and September. Caring \u2013 Beets require a lot of moisture, so water the plants when the weather is dry. This will prevent the plant from bolting. Remove weeds by hand or by using a hoe. Harvesting \u2013 Beets can be harvested when they are between the sizes of a golf ball or tennis ball. You may also harvest the leaves for compost or cook them like spinach . You may leave the roots sown later in the season if winters are mild. The superfood known as the beetroot \nBeetroot, more commonly known as beets, are increasingly becoming popular as a superfood for their many health benefits. Beets contain high levels of vitamins A and C, and is a rich source of iron . The root vegetable is also packed with essential minerals such as manganese, potassium, magnesium, and phosphorus. Beets are also a good source of folate, thiamine, riboflavin, and pantothenic acid. \nBeets have also been shown to keep certain health conditions in check. According to researchers at the Wake Forest University, drinking beetroot juice helps improve blood flow and oxygenation in certain areas of the brain affected by age. This demonstrates that beets may show potential in slowing down the progression of dementia in older patients. Beets are also contain high levels of choline. The anti-inflammatory compound is known to boost learning and memory, sleep, and muscle movement. Beets for healthy blood pressure \nA growing number of studies also show that beets help maintain a healthy blood pressure level . An Australian study finds that people who consumed beetroot juice attained significant reductions in blood pressure levels than those who did not. Another Australian study reveals that drinking beetroot juice promotes cancer remission, suggesting that the vegetable is a natural cancer fighter . \nWith so many health benefits, it only proves beneficial to cultivate beets.

But what happens when the parents are 7,000 miles apart? \nAh, glad you asked. Nicole's husband Wesley is deployed overseas, so Nicole decided to hire Traci at Traci Lynn Photography . Traci needed to figure out a way to make sure Wesley could be included in this incredibly special time even if he couldn't be there in person. So the photographer devised a way to incorporate Wesley from half a world away to make the waiting game a little less bittersweet. \nMore: Crazy maternity shoots we adore \nThe couple knew they wanted their maternity photo series to have a military vibe, so Nicole and Traci used a photo of Wesley as well as some dog tags in her pictures. The best part? Wesley had a friend take a photo of him \u2014 posing in just the right way \u2014 and Traci edited the pics together to create a one-of-a-kind maternity portrait that tugs at our heartstrings in a big way. Gah! No, we're not crying, you're crying.

Although we have no doubt Nicole and Wesley will have the pleasure of sharing diaper duty someday \u2014 and soon, we hope.

It can take two to three weeks for symptoms to appear and infected persons are contagious three days before and up to five days after those symptoms appear. Texas has had 221 cases of mumps this year, the most in 20 years. \nMayo Clinic infectious diseases specialist Dr. Pritish Tosh says, \"The measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) is very good in preventing mumps but not perfect. Often we see a large group of people and some of them are vaccinated, but then mumps is introduced to that population by people who aren't vaccinated and they act as amplifiers of the infection. There are going to be some who were adequately vaccinated, but, because it's not 100 percent effective for mumps, you start to see cases \u2014 not just in people who have not been vaccinated, but also in some people who have been adequately vaccinated.\" \nWatch: Dr. Pritish Tosh talks about mumps vaccines. \nWhat is mumps? \nMumps is a contagious viral illness that typically starts with a few days of fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite, followed by swollen salivary glands. \"Most people who get mumps get swelling in the neck area, and it causes a fever. And, for most people who get mumps, that\u2019s the end of it. They get better on their own,\" says Dr. Tosh. \"However, there are several complications. This used to be the No. 1 cause of sensorineural hearing loss in children and can cause infection in the brain.\" \nComplications from mumps include: Meningitis (infection of the covering of the brain and spinal cord) Deafness (temporary or permanent) Encephalitis (swelling of the brain) Orchitis (swelling of the testicles) in males who have reached puberty Oophoritis (swelling of the ovaries) and/or mastitis (swelling of the breasts) in females who have reached puberty \nThe best prevention is vaccination. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends children get two doses of MMR vaccine, starting with the first dose at 15 months and the second at 4 to 6 years. Teens and adults also should also be up to date on their MMR vaccination. The CDC says there has been a 99 percent decrease in mumps cases since the mumps vaccination program in 1967.

The researchers say they hope their efforts eventually will help physicians more accurately identify which women may benefit from enhanced breast cancer screening. Their findings are published in JAMA Oncology . \n\"Many of the genes on commercial hereditary cancer clinical genetic testing panels do not have defined roles in breast cancer,\" says Fergus Couch, Ph.D., a geneticist at Mayo Clinic and lead author of the study. \"The involvement of several of the genes in breast cancer susceptibility has not been determined. And for other genes we do not have accurate estimates of the risk level.\" \nUsing a large clinical testing data set from Ambry Genetics , Dr. Couch and his colleagues sought to define the genes involved in breast cancer and provide estimates of cancer risk for each of the genes that predispose a patient to breast cancer. \n\"We were able to confirm that genes, including BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, ATM and PALB2, play a role in breast cancer development, which was not surprising,\u201d says Dr. Couch. \"We also unexpectedly found that the BARD1, RAD51D and MSH6 genes convey a moderate risk for breast cancer development.\" \nDr. Couch and his colleagues also ruled out several genes as breast cancer genes, including RAD50 and MRE11A.

There\u2019s a Real Reason Why Kids Grab at Boobs \u2014 and No, It\u2019s Not \u201cDisturbing\u201d Blair Johnson \nCanadian supermodel Tillie Medland recently posted a video to her Instagram account that\u2019s sparked quite the Internet debate. In it, Medland is seen holding her 2-year-old nephew Jetson, when he suddenly reaches his hand down her sports bra and, you guessed it, heads straight for her right breast. The model\u2019s reaction to the toddler\u2019s action is one of stunned surprise, but quickly descends into a fit of laughter. \nMuch of Instagram, however, was not as amused. \n\u201cI feel weird,\u201d wrote one user. \n\u201cDisturbing she isn\u2019t correcting him,\u201d added another. \nMany of the other judgy comments that rolled in were a mix of shocked and surprised, as well \u2014 with many insinuating that the act had sexual undertones. \nBut as the father of a now-3-year-old son, I wasn\u2019t surprised at all. Nor did I find it to be anything but harmless. In fact, I was happy to know my little guy wasn\u2019t the only one who\u2019s pulled this move in public. Yes, I too have been in Tillie\u2019s shoes, having had my nipples handled on more than one occasion by my child in front of others. \n\u201cThis is behavior I see many babies and young kids use to communicate a need for food and/or connection,\u201d Kate Zachary, an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant, tells Babble. \u201cTillie obviously did not feel uncomfortable with this sign of affection, or her body, and so she shared the moment on social media.\u201d \nMedland herself tells Babble that Jetson was breastfed until he was 6 months old, and has exhibited similar behavior with his mother, Elena (who was the one working the camera for the moment). \nChild Development Specialist Linda Barker also weighed in, adding: \n\u201cWe know that one of the first sensory connections that a child has is through touch. This is vital for a strong attachment and provides an important way of communicating between a child and a mother.\u201d Related Post Study Says Giving Kids Chores Actually Makes Them More Successful \u2014 So Nag Away! \nAnd, evidently, a father. My own son stopped nursing when he was around 17 months. But just like Jetson, that didn\u2019t stop him for going back to an area of the body known to be a source of comfort. \nIf you don\u2019t believe me, I have photographic evidence. Here\u2019s a photo of my son and me on a weekend away from his mommy \u2014 as his hand reaches right down my shirt. Image Source: Blair Johnson \nAnd that wasn\u2019t the only time he did it over the course of our time away. The next day, we were around family we don\u2019t see very often, and my son was back at it. Yes, I got some questionable looks from aunts and uncles, but I just explained to them it was my son\u2019s way of feeling safe in an unfamiliar environment. After all, in lieu of my wife\u2019s absence, my upper body was the closest thing to the safe harbor of his former source of nourishment. \n\u201cSnuggling in the bosom of a woman \u2014 whether she is breastfeeding or not \u2014 is how brand new babies spend most of their time, and as they grow up they continue to return for feelings of safety,\u201d Zachary noted. \nI will say my son stopped utilizing this coping mechanism before he turned 3, soon after the weekend mentioned. And my wife pointed out the sensory move has been linked to the final stages of weening for breastfed children. \nAs for Medland, the wide array of both positive and negative comments she\u2019s received following her Instagram post \u2014 which has been viewed nearly 200,000 times as of this writing \u2014 seem to keep rolling in. But I\u2019m here to say the video should be taken for what it is: a wholly innocent clip of a young child doing what is completely natural to them. \nZachary reminds us: \n\u201cIt\u2019s clear that people have forgotten that the breast was made primarily for feeding babies and children. Breasts have become hyper sexualized \u2014 no doubt \u2014 but that doesn\u2019t mean that when a child like Jetson reaches for what he sees as as primary source of comfort that it is a sexual act.\u201d \nAs a baseball fan and a proud father of a child who has done the exact same thing, I\u2019ll admit it may seem strange at first to see a kid reach second base. But when put into proper context, there should be a sense of nurturing from this heartwarming act. At the end of the day, there\u2019s nothing \u201cstrange\u201d about it at all.

Click here for additional information. Mom Has Perfect Response After Stranger Tries to Sell Her a Weight-Loss Product Chaunie Brusie \nWe\u2019ve all been there. One minute you\u2019re chatting with someone about your baby or opening up a cheerful exchange with a friend you haven\u2019t seen in a while, when suddenly the conversation takes a swift detour you should have seen coming: \n\u201cHey, have you ever thought about trying XYZ product I am now selling? It\u2019s totally changed my life and I swear I\u2019m not one of those salesly people!\u201d \nCue the moment you want to smack your head against the wall. And while most women are no strangers to these types of exchanges, one woman just called out exactly why these types of sales tactics that target new mothers can be especially problematic. \nIn an all-too-real post , 29-year-old mom of three and jewelry designer Kelly Diane Howland from Northern Indiana, described how she had been out shopping at Target with her 2\u00bd-week-old daughter when an older woman approached and began asking questions about her baby. \nAt first, Howland didn\u2019t think much of the woman\u2019s conversation. That is, until she dropped The Question \u2014 asking Howland if she had ever heard of a skincare and nutrition company that offers everything from cleanses to shakes to fitness apparel. \nHowland goes on to explain in her post why it was so disheartening to be asked this. Mainly, it made her feel targeted as a new mom. After all, the question implies that she would be looking to lose weight after having her baby; it implies that new moms are supposed to feel ashamed about their bodies and desperate to try anything \u2014 even when it comes recommended by a total stranger you just met in Target while out for some \u201cme time\u201d. \nHowland was very careful to point out that it\u2019s not the company, or the woman, or even the work that is problematic. It\u2019s the bigger message that this sends about how our culture wants women to feel like a failure for not immediately dropping the weight post-baby. \n\u201cLet\u2019s not pretend that approaching me specifically was a coincidence,\u201d Howland wrote. \u201cBecause it\u2019s not like she ran up to every female at Target to hand out her card. But she did come to me \u2013 with my baby billboard of being brand new postpartum. We all know that this culture hammers into postpartum women a lot of physical insecurity about their bodies after delivering their miracles from their wombs. I don\u2019t think I have to spell out for a single woman the cultural pressure that postpartum mothers face regarding their physical appearance. We know. We all know. She knew. And that\u2019s why she approached me.\u201d Image Source: Kelly Diane Howland \nAfter snapping a selfie in that very moment, Howland posted her message to her Facebook page where it garnering over 10,000 shares and many comments from women who applaud her standing up to a culture that fails to support women in the most basic manner after birth. \nHowland says her inbox has been inundated with messages from women who are sharing their own stories of being made to feel like they are not enough, simply for the way their bodies look. \n\u201cI have so many message requests in my Facebook messenger folders of women who are privately writing to me to tell me their stories of feeling insecure, of being made to not feel good enough, of feeling pressure or being approached by people with ideas that they should change, or improve themselves, or could be better than they are currently,\u201d Howland tells Babble. \nAnd the new mom pointed out to that even an \u201cinnocent\u201d sales pitch from someone just trying to make a living can have a lasting impact on a new mother who might be struggling with body image issues or postpartum depression. \nIt\u2019s awful when you think about it; no one knows the fragile mental state any mom might be in. Howland admits she, too, has struggled with body image issues after going through college as a size 2 and now being \u201cplus size.\u201d She notes that it\u2019s taken a lot of personal development and growth in the past two years as a mom to become more body positive. Image Source: Kelly Diane Howland \n\u201cMotherhood is amazing and the female body\u2019s ability to carry and birth babies is incredible and yet our culture is somehow obsessed with trying to erase any evidence of that on our frame and when I sat and pondered that\u2026 I was baffled. It didn\u2019t make sense. It practically seemed absurd. I decided I no longer bought into that. These days I really love my body and try to honor and cherish her for all she does for me on a daily basis, even if she isn\u2019t \u2018perfect.'\u201d \nI, for one, am glad Howland is speaking up for every mom who has ever felt like she\u2019s not enough (and for every mom who wants to cruise Target without being the target of a sales pitch for a body that\u2019s just fine the way it is, thank you very much).

And of course, it is\u2014you think diet and visions of deprivation, food that tastes like sandpaper, and utter misery dance in your head. But the times are a-changin' because the anti-diet is on the rise, and according to a 2015 survey, sales of diets and diet products are on the decline . And diet pills, once considered the magic cure for those last stubborn 10 pounds, are down by 20 percent. Yet, weight-loss surgeries such as gastric bypass, banding, or sleeves are more popular than ever. And studies suggest that most bariatric surgery patients are successfully maintaining their weight loss \u2014while those on a more traditional diet plan gain the weight back within three years. But, if you're (understandably) apprehensive of surgery, there's a new product on the market which may have the benefits of bariatric surgery\u2014but in pill form. \nThe Obalon Balloon System is the first and only swallowable, FDA-approved balloon system for weight loss. Typically (and under doctor supervision) you swallow three pills over a three-month period. The pill transforms into a balloon that takes up space in your stomach, causing you to eat less because you already feel \"full.\" Proponents say that you'll feel just as satiated as you would after a huge meal because you're tricking your brain. If this sounds too good to be true, know that this is by no means a quick fix. You should not consider this option unless you are mildly to moderately obese with a body mass index between 30 and 40. (Remember, though, that BMI isn't everything .) This isn't for someone who just wants to eat less. (Face it, everyone has had a binge-eating Netflix situation they've regretted later.) According to Jonathan Cohen, M.D. , clinical professor of medicine at NYU, and creator of the Kips Bay Integrative Weight Management Program, the ideal candidate is \"a person who is not quite a candidate for bariatric surgery or really does not want to undergo a surgical procedure.\" And he emphasizes that anyone who wants to use the pill to lose weight must truly be committed to making major diet and lifestyle changes. Once you've swallowed the pill, that's when the hard work begins. \nSo, what exactly happens if you decide to take these balloon pills? For starters, you're looking at a six-month commitment and treatment plan. You swallow the capsule in your doctor's office and then the doctor inflates it (not exactly the \"magic bean\" idea you had!)\u2014you're awake and can go back to work and normal life activities immediately. Your doctor will have you swallow a second balloon capsule one month later and a third two months after that. All balloons are removed six months after the first capsule is swallowed\u2014but beware, removal requires a minor endoscopic procedure, in which narrow tube-like instrument is passed through the mouth into the esophagus and stomach to retrieve the balloons. You'll be lightly sedated. \nFor those who have tried Obalon, the results have been pretty positive\u2014the average weight loss (when used with a diet and exercise program) is between 15 and 50 pounds. And on average, 89.5 percent of the total weight lost was maintained after one year. \nHowever, it's not a commitment that should be taken lightly, as the system isn't currently covered by insurance and could set you back as much as $9,000. If you decide to have it, you should think of it as an investment in your long-term health and well-being. \"It needs to be done with great motivation on the part of the patient, their support system, and their care providers,\" says Dr. Cohen.", "crawled": "2017-04-14T23:56:33.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-14T22:55:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "1c4c4a6ca33dc6ea494fa28b5c54828bed7f3605", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 581, "likes": 581}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "shape.com", "participants_count": 0, "site_section": "http://news.google.com/news?output=rss&q=weight+loss", "uuid": "1c4c4a6ca33dc6ea494fa28b5c54828bed7f3605", "section_title": "weight loss - Google News", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 5, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8qwsRYssdDUqqS_HHmagdoZzqDz4RQtQTjJkbgqfEEcbmPFSylm1JFZhRPEaZw.oMrC7h1Q9THkOa3bY0WrpNBI9tjJH7c1CYsKOOoO_pJpQZEq59QCMe0iqFNuwaEe56XxcNd43.HuA--", "domain_rank": 5945, "main_image": "http://images.shape.mdpcdn.com/sites/shape.com/files/styles/facebook_og_image/public/fb-pink-blue-balloon.jpg", "site_full": "www.shape.com", "title_full": "Why Are People Are Taking Pills That Turn Into Balloons In Their Stomachs? - Shape Magazine", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Why Are People Are Taking Pills That Turn Into Balloons In Their Stomachs? - Shape Magazine", "published": "2017-04-14T22:55:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8qwsRYssdDUqqS_HHmagdoZzqDz4RQtQTjJkbgqfEEcbmPFSylm1JFZhRPEaZw.oMrC7h1Q9THkOa3bY0WrpNBI9tjJH7c1CYsKOOoO_pJpQZEq59QCMe0iqFNuwaEe56XxcNd43.HuA--", "author": "", "external_links": [], "title": "Why Are People Are Taking Pills That Turn Into Balloons In Their Stomachs? - Shape Magazine", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Game over: We crossed the red line years ago and no one is telling you: The world as we know it is collapsing like a pack of cards \n  News Editors Tags: animals , disaster , Wild Life , WWF \n( Natural News ) When the White House\u2019s top spokesman, Press Secretary Sean Spicer said this week that President Bashar al-Assad had committed atrocities worse than Nazi leader Adolf Hitler\u2026 Hitler, as the rest of the world knows, gassed 6 million Jews in WWII\u2026 And a CEO of a top world airline company claimed one of \u201chis\u201d customers acted \u201cdisruptive and belligerent\u201d as he was dragged helplessly, screaming and bloodied by 4 airline thugs, down the aisle of a jet after refusing to give up his seat voluntarily, why should he anyway?

It really is that bad. \nWarming seas are causing toxic dead zones all over the world\u2019s oceans killing billions of fish, tropical barrier reefs around the world are dying due to the warmth and with massive over fishing we are causing too much stress on the fish which are left, without doubt, we are too far down the line to save our oceans, they too, soon will die just like the fish inside them and the animals on land. \nA study by Boris Worm, PhD, of Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, \u2014 with colleagues in the U.K., U.S., Sweden, and Panama claims all ocean life will be extinct within the next 25 years. Once again the world we know won\u2019t be here to witness the event \nMajor quakes up by more than 400% since 1900 \nMajor earthquakes have risen more than 400% since 1900 despite USGS telling us otherwise, in the first 16 years of the 20 th century 97 major quakes were recorded on Earth compared to 2, 697 in the first 16 years of the 21 st century. \nVolcano activity shows a similar spike to the quakes. \nDroughts and floods \nEthiopia, South Sudan, Somalia, Niger, Kenya and Cameroon are enduring their worst drought in 50 years with millions suffering severe hunger. \nIn a new phenomenon \u201dthe weather bomb\u201d which drops incredible amounts of water in an area very quickly has wiped out other crippling droughts around the world more or less overnight\u2026 \nPeru, Colombia, California, Zimbabwe, New Zealand and Madagascar, Namibia and Angola, all have had yearlong droughts virtually wiped out this year, overnight, by massive amounts of rainfall often bringing many casualties and damage with it. \nWild fires \nWith nearly half a billion dead trees in California and Colorado it\u2019s not surprising wildfires are accelerating in the U.S. However, it\u2019s not just America it is a global phenomenon which is rising at an alarming rate just in the last year. \nIn Florida the first three months of 2017 saw a 250% increase in wild-fires but the new \u201csuper fire\u201d are not only destroying millions of acres of bush but appear to be cable of destroying entire cities. \nRecently, Christchurch, New Zealand was hit hard by wild-fires with thousands evacuated; Chile had its biggest ever wild-fire with a whole town destroyed. \nWildfires across several states in central U.S. in March, consumed an incredible one million acres killing thousands of calving cattle causing evacuation of thousands. \nThe monster \u2018Blue Cut\u2019 and Sand Canyon fire\u2019s last summer caused the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people and caused devastation on a Biblical scale. \nRead more at: thebigwobble.org Join the Health Ranger's FREE email newsletter \nGet breaking news alerts on GMOs, fluoride, superfoods, natural cures and more... \n(Note: Avoid using gmail.com addresses, because Google deliberately censors this email newsletter to protect Big Pharma's profits.)

But this prolific cartoon and entertainment icon is reportedly taking its perversion agenda to a whole new level with the introduction of a humanoid robot concept for children that some experts warn could morph into a type of sex toy product for underage adolescents. \nAs sick and twisted as it sounds, the writing seems to be on the wall as to the next phase of Disney\u2019s subversion of the world\u2019s youth: To bring about their demise through a transhumanism push in the form of new \u201ccuddly\u201d robot toys. Evidence of this is revealed in a recent patent filed by Disney that depicts a \u201csoft humanoid robot\u201d that kids can play with \u2013 and that will play with kids. \nA rendering of Disney\u2019s disturbing invention depicts a bulbous, \u201chuggable\u201d shape with two arms that purportedly will look like a friendly creature in its finalized form.

Reports suggest that this humanoid robot will use these motions to directly interact with children in a physical way, effectively becoming a part of their lives and influencing their development. \n\u201cDisney research scientists are exploring the manufacturing of robots that can safely interact with young people, effectively altering how kids grow up, which will further allow for robots to integrate with mankind,\u201d warns Nate Brown from Christian Truther. Disney humanoid robot prototype \u2018Big Hero 6\u2019 character made with fake skin, fluids \nDisney\u2019s patent for the concept admits that the goal is to create a human-like robot that will physically interact with children without scaring them. It has already produced a test version of this type of robot based on the \u201cBig Hero 6\u201d character Baymax, which reportedly contains a durable outer shell that looks and feels like \u201csoft skin,\u201d and that contains fluid inside its upper body. \nThe patent document describes the concept as \u201cinteractive guidance,\u201d a.k.a. a new type of parental influence for children that excludes their actual parents. Expect to see more and more of these types of humanoid robots in stores, amusement parks, and even schools, hospitals, and people\u2019s homes, the document adds, to \u201cprovide therapy, and lend an extra set of hands.\u201d \nWhat this all amounts to is total invasion and destruction of the family. Some are calling it the \u201cfourth industrial revolution\u201d \u2013 the next step in subverting humanity by pushing a transhumanist agenda. The endgame is a total merger of man with machine, or singularity, something that Google executive Ray Kurzweil believes will become a reality within the next 10 years . \nThe groupthink, hive mind result of this next phase of human reprogramming , should it succeed, will likely create the \u201cbeast\u201d system necessary for the elite to implement a global control grid operated by a one-world government.

Reports suggest that this humanoid robot will use these motions to directly interact with children in a physical way, effectively becoming a part of their lives and influencing their development. \n\u201cDisney research scientists are exploring the manufacturing of robots that can safely interact with young people, effectively altering how kids grow up, which will further allow for robots to integrate with mankind,\u201d warns Nate Brown from Christian Truther. Disney humanoid robot prototype \u2018Big Hero 6\u2019 character made with fake skin, fluids \nDisney\u2019s patent for the concept admits that the goal is to create a human-like robot that will physically interact with children without scaring them. It has already produced a test version of this type of robot based on the \u201cBig Hero 6\u201d character Baymax, which reportedly contains a durable outer shell that looks and feels like \u201csoft skin,\u201d and that contains fluid inside its upper body. \nThe patent document describes the concept as \u201cinteractive guidance,\u201d a.k.a. a new type of parental influence for children that excludes their actual parents. Expect to see more and more of these types of humanoid robots in stores, amusement parks, and even schools, hospitals, and people\u2019s homes, the document adds, to \u201cprovide therapy, and lend an extra set of hands.\u201d \nWhat this all amounts to is total invasion and destruction of the family. Some are calling it the \u201cfourth industrial revolution\u201d \u2013 the next step in subverting humanity by pushing a transhumanist agenda. The endgame is a total merger of man with machine, or singularity, something that Google executive Ray Kurzweil believes will become a reality within the next 10 years . \nThe groupthink, hive mind result of this next phase of human reprogramming , should it succeed, will likely create the \u201cbeast\u201d system necessary for the elite to implement a global control grid operated by a one-world government. Control and human enslavement is the true purpose of such heinous evil, and if parents don\u2019t step up to resist this onslaught of evil, it could very soon become a reality. \n\u201cDisney has previously been exposed for their subliminal sexual, and occult imagery throughout their motion pictures and productions, but what they do next, could change the future,\u201d adds Brown. \u201cTo accelerate its acceptance they go after the minds of children, and Disney\u2019s new patent further proves that point.\u201d \nSources:", "crawled": "2017-04-14T20:06:18.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-14T18:21:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "7a3fbdd9d8de19a0744b92048af8dcf552dfae92", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 670, "likes": 670}, "gplus": {"shares": 10}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 5}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}}, "country": "US", "site": "naturalnews.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.naturalnews.com/rss.xml", "uuid": "7a3fbdd9d8de19a0744b92048af8dcf552dfae92", "section_title": "NaturalNews.com", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 6, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_sejtWCbZc4MoE7EUHucFe2XkQogjQWfnVurtEbY1yBlewG_hkRJZPSyf1hu4SEFzi1L4m0zVwnGc4Ir2c13psFv.C330ZSykybbi3xsZEfNeQwEetORtQQTImReCen0nRZBrLfoH9TSk.FoCxSztavFXsvQecXw.PQDKBjTSRuaHolnK21uQxUST8nv0Ux6HzW2KnJ0WgIxGpJpMcXTbY", "domain_rank": 6416, "main_image": "http://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2017/01/artificial-intelligence-AI-e1459877372521.jpg", "site_full": "www.naturalnews.com", "title_full": "After pushing LGBT agenda for children, Disney files patent on cuddly robots that could be used as \"sex toys\" for children", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "After pushing LGBT agenda for children, Disney files patent on cuddly robots that could be used as \"sex toys\" for children", "published": "2017-04-14T18:21:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "brown"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ray kurzweil"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "nate brown"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ethan huff"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "christian truther"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "disney"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "google"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_sejtWCbZc4MoE7EUHucFe2XkQogjQWfnVurtEbY1yBlewG_hkRJZPSyf1hu4SEFzi1L4m0zVwnGc4Ir2c13psFv.C330ZSykybbi3xsZEfNeQwEetORtQQTImReCen0nRZBrLfoH9TSk.FoCxSztavFXsvQecXw.PQDKBjTSRuaHolnK21uQxUST8nv0Ux6HzW2KnJ0WgIxGpJpMcXTbY", "author": "Ethan Huff", "external_links": [], "title": "After pushing LGBT agenda for children, Disney files patent on cuddly robots that could be used as \"sex toys\" for children", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "9. Congestive heart failure \n10. Lipomas \nIt's important to understand that if your dog has one or more of these conditions and is also overweight or obese, there is very likely a connection between his weight and his suffering. The exception would be if he acquired the disease(s) before he became overweight. \nI think there's a tendency among guardians of obese pets to view disease in their dogs as unrelated to their weight. \nCouple that with too many veterinarians who are very hesitant to bring up obesity as a risk factor for disease, and you have a recipe for the disaster we're now seeing \u2014 an epidemic of overweight, sick and debilitated animal companions. Every Ounce of Excess Weight Is Triggering Deadly Inflammation in Your Dog's Body \nAccording to Dr. Ernie Ward, a veterinarian and founder of the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention (APOP), over the last 20 years, the general perception of obesity has evolved from \"fat is funny\" to \"fat is deadly\" to \"fat is boring.\" 2 \nPeople are ignoring warnings about obesity even though they know being overweight is unhealthy for both humans and pets. \nWard says people are practicing \"optimism bias\" in choosing to believe that the debilitating, life-shortening effects of obesity won't happen to them or their beloved animals. It's a way of coping, but it's also a way of avoiding making crucial lifestyle changes. \nThat's why Ward now discusses heavy pets not in terms of their weight, but rather the deadly inflammation the extra weight triggers. Excess fat causes what Ward calls an \"adipokine storm\" inside your dog's or cat's body: \n\"Adipokines are signal proteins produced by fat tissue,\" Ward explains. \"Leptin, adiponectin and interleukin-6 (IL-6) are examples. We know adipokines cause or contribute to hundreds of harmful inflammatory processes throughout the body. \nThink of every fat cell as a little factory pumping out hundreds of potentially toxic compounds. Multiply that by millions or billions in an obese pet. The real danger of excess fat isn't the fat; it's the inflammation the fat causes.\" 3 \nWard firmly believes inflammation is the biggest threat pets face today. Scientific evidence of the damage excessive inflammation causes to the body continues to mount. \nAnd in my opinion, toxic fat combined with a toxic environment ( lawn chemicals , PBDEs, vaccines and flea and tick pesticides, to name just a few) plus malnutrition, courtesy of the processed pet food industry, is a 100 percent guarantee your pet will suffer from at least one degenerative condition in his or her lifetime. \nIn addition to the conditions listed above, another disease associated with inflammation is cancer. The cancer rate in today's dogs is a staggering 1 in 2. Processed Pet Food Is a Root Cause of Pet Obesity \nMost holistic veterinarians, including me, believe processed pet food is by far the biggest contributor to the pet obesity epidemic. Most commercially available pet diets aren't biologically appropriate for dogs, and are loaded with exactly the types of ingredients that promote weight gain and inflammation in the body. \nIt's also true that today's dogs are overfed and under-exercised, however, the first thing I scrutinize with any overweight dog is the type of food she's eating. \nI look for things like the omega-6 to omega-3 ratio in an animal's diet. Food high in omega-6 essential fatty acids and low in omega-3s (which is the case with most processed pet diets) is associated with inflammatory conditions. \nCommercial pet food is also typically high in pro-inflammatory carbohydrates, including processed, high glycemic grains and starchy vegetables like potatoes or lectin-loaded legumes. \nIf a dog is fed any dry pet food it's a red flag, because all dry pet food contains some form of starch \u2014 kibble cannot be produced without it. Feed Your Dog Like This \nWhether your dog is overweight or a perfect weight, the best food you can offer him is a nutritionally balanced, species-appropriate diet consisting of fresh, whole foods, preferably raw, organic and non-GMO. It includes: \n\u2713 High-quality protein, including muscle meat, organs and bone (protein should make up 75 percent of a healthy dog's diet) \n\u2713 Low to moderate levels of animal fat (depending on your pet's activity level) \n\u2713 High levels of EPA and DHA (omega-3 essential fatty acids) \n\u2713 A few fresh cut vegetables and a bit of fruit, pureed \n\u2713 A whole food vitamin/mineral supplement that meets the additional E, zinc, iron, copper, manganese and vitamin D deficiencies often found in homemade diets OR enough of these hard-to-source foods in whole food forms, daily \n\u2713 Beneficial additions such as probiotics, digestive enzymes and super green foods \n\u2713 High moisture content \n\u2713 No grains or starches \nYou must also practice portion control religiously, which for most dog parents means feeding a carefully measured morning and evening meal. And don't forget to factor in any calories from healthy treats . Daily exercise, including at least 20 minutes of consistent aerobic activity, will help your dog burn fat, increase muscle tone and maintain the integrity of his musculoskeletal system. Throw Your Dog a Metabolic Curve Ball \nOccasionally, a dog may have difficulty losing weight even when she's being fed the right food in the right portions and is getting plenty of exercise. If this is the case with your dog, you might want to consider throwing her a \"metabolic curve ball\" by changing the timing of her meals. \nDogs are biologically programmed for regular periods of fasting. In the wild, they catch and eat prey animals and then go for extended periods without food. From a metabolic standpoint, feeding your pet more often than she needs may lead to weight gain. In addition, it may also have a negative influence on her immune system in ways we're only beginning to understand. \nNot long ago I visited the Epigenix Foundation to learn about the amazing work KetoPet Sanctuary is doing to reverse aggressive cancers in dogs through diet, as well as strategies for altering and modulating metabolism, and ultimately the immune system, by modifying how we feed them. \nA technique called time-restricted feeding (TRF) is one such option that's proven effective for many animals. For dogs, this means allowing the gastrointestinal tract to rest in between meals for 16 to 24 hours (feeding one large meal a day, or two smaller meals six to eight hours apart), which mimics their eating behavior in the wild. \nWhat we're learning is that changing not only what we feed dogs but how and when we feed dogs can substantially alter their immuno-metabolic health. 4 \nI witnessed this first-hand with a friend who was dog sitting an overweight Labrador Retriever . Calorie restriction alone didn't work, so he tried TRF. He fed the Lab the same number of calories but in one daily meal instead of two, and the dog lost 15 pounds in three months! TRF is certainly worth trying if your dog has reached a weight-loss plateau. 0", "crawled": "2017-04-14T18:07:18.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-14T13:00:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "84793dad632a72effaf09e0092a23e8357e15477", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 988, "likes": 988}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 25}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}}, "country": "US", "site": "mercola.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://articles.mercola.com/sites/mainfeed.aspx", "uuid": "84793dad632a72effaf09e0092a23e8357e15477", "section_title": "", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 9, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWasxINCeJlgvbzGjfldeymyez2NQhfuHDDbzadQsQ8XAzuWgtw1PHIX2EntIQrj5uoLlrQgcA6_DkLT2.wooXMz7lvKV3VhQYV.w_zdNjGUrSD0KHCTHAnozWMLjlodCNY-", "domain_rank": 2440, "main_image": "https://media.mercola.com/ImageServer/Public/2017/April/dangers-pet-obesity-fb.jpg", "site_full": "healthypets.mercola.com", "title_full": "Avoid Tragedy: Check Your Pet for This Underlying Condition", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Avoid Tragedy: Check Your Pet for This Underlying Condition", "published": "2017-04-14T13:00:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "ward"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ernie ward"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "ward"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "epa"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "association for pet obesity prevention"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dha"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "epigenix foundation"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWasxINCeJlgvbzGjfldeymyez2NQhfuHDDbzadQsQ8XAzuWgtw1PHIX2EntIQrj5uoLlrQgcA6_DkLT2.wooXMz7lvKV3VhQYV.w_zdNjGUrSD0KHCTHAnozWMLjlodCNY-", "author": "Dr. Becker", "external_links": [], "title": "Avoid Tragedy: Check Your Pet for This Underlying Condition", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "| 15,129 views \nCauliflower is an extremely healthy vegetable that\u2019s a significant source of nutrients. \nIt also contains unique plant compounds that may reduce the risk of several diseases, including heart disease and cancer. \nAdditionally, it\u2019s weight loss friendly and incredibly easy to add to your diet. \nHere are 8 science-based health benefits of cauliflower. 1. Contains Many Nutrients \nThe nutrition profile of cauliflower is quite impressive. \nCauliflower is very low in calories yet high in vitamins. In fact, cauliflower contains some of almost every vitamin and mineral that you need ( 1 ). \nHere is an overview of the nutrients found in 1 cup, or 128 grams, of cauliflower ( 1 ): Calories: 25 Vitamin C: 77% of the RDI Vitamin K: 20% of the RDI Vitamin B6: 11% of the RDI Folate: 14% of the RDI Pantothenic acid: 7% of the RDI Potassium: 9%   8% of the RDI Magnesium: 4% of the RDI Phosphorus: 4% of the RDI \nSummary: Cauliflower is an excellent source of vitamins and minerals, containing some of almost every vitamin and mineral that you need. 2. High in Fiber \nCauliflower is quite high in fiber , which is beneficial for overall health. \nThere are 3 grams of fiber in one cup of cauliflower, which is 10% of your daily needs ( 1 ). \nFiber is important because it feeds the healthy bacteria in your gut that help reduce inflammation and promote digestive health ( 2 , 3 ). \nConsuming enough fiber may help prevent digestive conditions like constipation, diverticulitis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) ( 2 , 3 ). \nMoreover, studies show that a diet high in fiber-rich vegetables like cauliflower is linked with a lower risk of several illnesses, including heart disease, cancer and diabetes ( 4 , 5 , 6 ). \nFiber may also play a role in obesity prevention, due to its ability to promote fullness and reduce overall calorie intake ( 7 , 8 ). \nSummary: Cauliflower contains a high amount of fiber, which is important for digestive health and may reduce the risk of several chronic diseases. 3. Good Source of Antioxidants \nCauliflower is a great source of antioxidants, which protect your cells from harmful free radicals and inflammation . \nSimilar to other cruciferous vegetables, cauliflower is particularly high in glucosinolates and isothiocyanates, two antioxidants that have been shown to slow the growth of cancer cells ( 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 ). \nIn test-tube studies, glucosinolates and isothiocyanates have been shown to be especially protective against colon, lung, breast and prostate cancer ( 10 ). \nCauliflower contains carotenoid and flavonoid antioxidants as well, which have anti-cancer effects and may reduce the risk of several other illnesses, including heart disease ( 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 ). \nWhat\u2019s more, cauliflower contains high amounts of vitamin C, which acts as an antioxidant. It is well-known for its anti-inflammatory effects that may boost immune health and reduce the risk of heart disease and cancer ( 19 , 20 ). \nSummary: Cauliflower provides a significant amount of antioxidants, which are beneficial for reducing inflammation and protecting against several chronic diseases. 4. May Aid in Weight Loss \nCauliflower has several properties that may help with weight loss . \nFirst, it is low in calories with only 25 calories per cup, so you can eat a lot of it without gaining weight. \nIt can also serve as a low-calorie substitute for high-calorie foods, such as rice and flour. \nAs a good source of fiber, cauliflower slows digestion and promotes   This may automatically reduce the number of calories you eat throughout the day, an important factor in weight control ( 6 , 8 ). \nHigh water content is another weight loss friendly aspect of cauliflower. In fact, 92% of its weight is made up of water. Consuming lots of water-dense, low-calorie foods is associated with weight loss ( 1 , 21 ). \nSummary: Cauliflower is low in calories but high in fiber and water \u2014 all properties that may assist in weight loss. 5. High in Choline \nCauliflower is high in choline , an essential nutrient that many people are deficient in. \nOne cup of cauliflower contains 45 mg of choline, which is about 11% of the adequate intake (AI) for women and 8% for men ( 1 , 22 ). \nCholine has several important functions in the body. \nTo begin with, it plays a major role in maintaining the integrity of cell membranes, synthesizing DNA and supporting metabolism ( 23 , 24 ). \nCholine is also involved in brain development and the production of neurotransmitters that are necessary for a healthy nervous system. What\u2019s more, it helps prevent cholesterol from accumulating in the liver ( 24 ). \nThose who don\u2019t consume enough choline may have a higher risk of liver and heart disease, in addition to neurological disorders like dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s ( 25 , 26 ). \nNot many foods contain choline. Cauliflower, along with broccoli, is one of the best plant-based sources of the nutrient. \nSummary: Cauliflower is a good source of choline, a nutrient in which many people are lacking. It is involved in many processes in the body and works to prevent several diseases. 6. Rich in Sulforaphane \nCauliflower contains sulforaphane , an extensively studied antioxidant. \nMany test-tube and animal studies have found sulforaphane to be particularly helpful for suppressing cancer development by inhibiting enzymes that are involved in cancer and tumor growth ( 27 , 28 , 29 ). \nAccording to some studies, sulforaphane may also have the potential to stop cancer growth by destroying cells that are already damaged ( 27 , 28 , 29 ). \nSulforaphane appears to be most protective against colon and prostate cancer but has also been studied for its effects on many other cancers, such as breast, leukemia, pancreatic and melanoma ( 29 ). \nResearch shows that sulforaphane may also help reduce high blood pressure and keep arteries healthy \u2014 both major factors in preventing heart disease ( 30 ). \nFinally, animal studies suggest that sulforaphane may also play a role in diabetes prevention and reducing the risk of diabetes-induced complications, such as kidney disease ( 30 ). \nWhile more research is necessary to determine the extent of sulforaphane\u2019s effects in humans, its potential health benefits are promising. \nSummary: Cauliflower is rich is sulforaphane, a plant compound with many beneficial effects, such as reduced risk of cancer, heart disease and diabetes. 7. Low-Carb Alternative to Grains and Legumes \nCauliflower is incredibly versatile and can be used to replace grains and legumes in your diet. \nNot only is this a fantastic way to increase your veggie intake, but it is also especially helpful for those who follow low-carb diets . \nThis is because cauliflower is significantly lower in carbs than grains and legumes. \nFor example, a cup of cauliflower contains 5 grams of carbs. At the same time, a cup of rice contains 45 grams of carbs \u2014 nine times the amount of cauliflower ( 31 , 1 ). \nHere are some examples of recipes that can be made with cauliflower instead of grains and legumes: Cauliflower rice: Replace white or brown rice with cauliflower that has been grated and then cooked, as in this recipe . Cauliflower pizza crust: By pulsing cauliflower in a food processor and then making it into a dough, such as in this recipe , you can make a delicious pizza. Cauliflower hummus: Chickpeas can be replaced with cauliflower in hummus recipes like this one. Cauliflower mash: Instead of making mashed potatoes, try this recipe for a low-carb cauliflower mash that is easy to make. Cauliflower tortillas: Combine pulsed cauliflower with eggs to make low-carb tortillas that can be used for wraps, taco shells or burritos, as in this recipe . Cauliflower mac and cheese: Cooked cauliflower can be combined with milk, cheese and spices to make mac and cheese, like in this recipe . \nSummary: Cauliflower can replace grains and legumes in many recipes, which is a great way to eat more veggies or follow a low-carb diet. 8. Easy to Add to Your Diet \nNot only is cauliflower versatile, but it is also very easy to add to your diet. \nTo begin with, you can consume it raw, which requires very little preparation. You can enjoy raw cauliflower florets as a snack dipped in hummus or another healthy vegetable dip like this one. \nCauliflower can also be cooked in a variety of ways, such as steaming, roasting or saut\u00e9ing. It makes an excellent side dish or can be combined with dishes like soups, salads, stir-fries and casseroles. \nNot to mention, it is fairly cheap and widely available at most grocery stores. \nSummary: There are many ways to add cauliflower to your diet. It can be consumed cooked or raw and makes a fantastic addition to just about any dish. The Bottom Line \nCauliflower provides some powerful health benefits. \nIt is a great source of nutrients, including a few that many people need more of. \nPlus, cauliflower contains unique antioxidants that may reduce inflammation and protect against several diseases, such as cancer and heart disease. \nWhat\u2019s more, cauliflower is easy to add your diet. It\u2019s tasty, easy to prepare and can replace high-carb foods in several recipes.", "crawled": "2017-04-14T12:46:53.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-14T12:46:53.000+03:00", "uuid": "fe1cabcb67ce91510e6b70bac2f52090affe328f", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 772, "likes": 772}, "gplus": {"shares": 13}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 116}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "authoritynutrition.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/AuthorityNutrition", "uuid": "fe1cabcb67ce91510e6b70bac2f52090affe328f", "section_title": "Authority Nutrition", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 7, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRNqR.DAdjNvUy3ktTf3Sje433sJ_y3NEY8lNbMoJV0C8_xufaVK6CYjl_RGl9FSHo-", "domain_rank": 6095, "main_image": "https://cdn.authoritynutrition.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/cauliflower-on-table-large.jpg", "site_full": "authoritynutrition.com", "title_full": "The Top 8 Health Benefits of Cauliflower", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "The Top 8 Health Benefits of Cauliflower", "published": "2017-04-14T12:46:53.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "choline  cauliflower"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "brianna elliott"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "rdi vitamin k"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "good source of antioxidants  cauliflower"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRNqR.DAdjNvUy3ktTf3Sje433sJ_y3NEY8lNbMoJV0C8_xufaVK6CYjl_RGl9FSHo-", "author": "Brianna Elliott, RD", "external_links": [], "title": "The Top 8 Health Benefits of Cauliflower", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Dairy industry front group declares eating \u201cclean food\u201d promotes disease; tells youth to drink DIRTY MILK for lifelong health \n  Mike Adams Tags: animal cruelty , Clean Eating , clean food , dairy industry , dirty milk , disease , homogenized milk , nutritional illiteracy , osteoporosis , propaganda \n( Natural News ) In the latest hilarious example of fake science from a dirty, dishonest industry, the so-called National Osteoporosis Society \u2014 little more than a junk science front group for the dirty dairy industry \u2014 has declared clean eating to be a \u201cdangerous timebomb.\u201d According to the group, clean food promotes disease , while the best way to support lifelong health is to consume dirty foods such as processed milk and cheese that are loaded with artificial hormones and pesticides. (I\u2019m not making this up. See the link below\u2026) \nRight on cue, the dishonest mainstream media now decrees clean eating to be a \u201ccult\u201d that could cause horrible disease. Anyone who avoids processed sugar, homogenized milk, pesticide-laden foods or nutritionally-depleted refined starches is now condemned as a \u201ccultist\u201d by the hopelessly dishonest (and nutritionally illiterate) media, which depends on dairy industry advertising for its revenues. \n\u201c[T]he charity said many of those following the trends had no idea that cutting out major food groups could jeopardise their long-term health, with bones still developing in early adulthood,\u201d reports The Telegraph in a dairy industry propaganda piece that demonizes clean food diets. The same article goes on to condemn celebrities \u201cwho have boasted how they have cut out gluten, dairy, grains and refined sugars\u201d as if that\u2019s a horrible sin of some kind. \nPeople who choose to eat clean food are further smeared in the story which somehow equates clean food with a \u201cpoor diet,\u201d explaining: \nA poor diet for those in their teens and early twenties now could see a significant rise in the numbers of people suffering fractures and the complications associated with them in the future. \nThe story goes on to ridiculously equate drinking milk with preventing osteoporosis while insisting that people who eat clean, unprocessed foods are committing nutritional suicide. \nYes, The Telegraph is the same UK-based publication that openly attacks breastfeeding , falsely declaring that breastfeeding does nothing for the IQ of your child while promoting anti-breastfeeding propaganda groups that push infant formula from globalist food conglomerates. The message from The Telegraph ? Human breast milk is BAD for babies, but processed, homogenized cow\u2019s milk is GREAT for children and teens. \nFolks, it doesn\u2019t get any more idiotic than this. The Telegraph has just labeled itself a media \u201cDUNCE\u201d for life (as well as a real danger to the health of UK children who might be negatively influenced by the publisher\u2019s dangerous nutritional illiteracy). If there\u2019s any publication that should be labeled \u201c fake news \u201d on health matters, it\u2019s The Telegraph. And this story was authored by their Health Editor! Fact check: Processed MILK does not equal strong bones \nThe wildly dishonest dairy industry has long attempted to equate drinking milk with developing strong bones while glossing over the cardiovascular risks of consuming a processed, homogenized, pasteurized milk product. \nHere are some truths about milk the dairy industry doesn\u2019t want you to realize: \nTruth #1) Strong bones depend far more on vitamin D than milk. Most people get plenty of calcium in their diet, but without sufficient vitamin D in your blood, your bones can\u2019t efficiently use the calcium you\u2019re consuming. \nTruth #2) While raw milk can be very healthy, homogenized milk is artificially altered to change the structure of the fat molecules, making them more dangerous to your health and a major contributing factor to cardiovascular disease (and atherosclerosis). \nTruth #3) The pasteurization of milk destroys the lactase enzymes that make milk more easily digestible by consumers. This is one reason why so many people can\u2019t consume milk without experiencing extreme mucous, sinus congestion and even constipation: They can\u2019t digest the product because the lactase has been deactivated, causing many people to believe they are lactose-intolerant. \nTruth #4) There\u2019s more calcium in a glass of broccoli juice than a glass of milk. If you really want calcium and other nutrients , raw food juicing is by far the best way to get more calcium into your diet. The \u201cmilk = calcium\u201d myth is a total fabrication of the dishonest dairy industry, which has about as much scientific credibility as Big Tobacco. \nTruth #5) Most commercial dairy operations are cruel, inhumane animal factories that subject dairy cows to excruciating pain and suffering in order to produce corporate profits. \nTruth #6) Both BLOOD and PUS are legally allowed in commercial milk products. Few consumers know that pasteurized milk contains 150 times higher levels of blood and pus than fresh, raw milk. \nWARNING: Graphic video below, showing the extreme abuse of dairy cows: The dairy industry is totally freaking out that people are learning the truth about \u201cdirty milk\u201d \nAs the truth about the deceptions of the factory-run dairy industry continues to spread across social media, the dairy industry is ramping up its public relations propaganda arm, now trying to scare people into drinking more milk by claiming their bones will break if they don\u2019t. Even more shockingly, by attacking the \u201cclean eating\u201d movement that avoids processed dairy and cheese products, the dairy industry is admitting its products are DIRTY food . \nEven more absurdly, the industry insists that you can only be healthy if you eat sufficient quantities of their \u201cdirty food\u201d which is waning in terms of public demand. \nIt\u2019s already obvious this deceptive P.R. campaign is going to wildly backfire on the dairy industry. Do these corporate morons really believe that they can scare people into drinking more dirty milk by running around screaming that \u201cclean food\u201d is a horribly harmful diet? \nIt\u2019s just laughable. Pathetic, sad and laughable. If anything, all this is yet another great reminder why you should never buy factory produced milk or cheese products again . \nPersonally, I\u2019m a fan of making my own almond milk using a blender, fresh almonds, a nut milk bag and some water. It\u2019s the best-tasting milk in the world, and it\u2019s not produced with hormones, GMOs, pesticides or cruelty. If you want to consume cow\u2019s milk, get whole, fresh RAW cow\u2019s milk from a local farmer (and hope the food police don\u2019t arrest you for the \u201ccrime\u201d of purchasing real food).", "crawled": "2017-04-14T07:42:05.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-14T04:36:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "127435df69ffd942f980fb349ddcbd6caf0eac28", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 643, "likes": 643}, "gplus": {"shares": 29}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 17}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 7}}, "country": "US", "site": "naturalnews.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.naturalnews.com/rss.xml", "uuid": "127435df69ffd942f980fb349ddcbd6caf0eac28", "section_title": "NaturalNews.com", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 6, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_sejtWCbZc4MoE7EUHucFe2XkQogjQWfmXVbKafYviZVactrm7FyjpN2AS9NkS4cYpkSKu1cpreDGAVYMdfnAhIeJyb60LDj35L3MiYsaz_IuminPJLmnf7umkOesN.W93cJVZmX7dgiCIFjSea3d4", "domain_rank": 6416, "main_image": "http://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2017/04/Dairy-Farm-Milking-Cows.jpg", "site_full": "www.naturalnews.com", "title_full": "Dairy industry front group declares eating \"clean food\" promotes disease; tells youth to drink DIRTY MILK for lifelong health", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Dairy industry front group declares eating \"clean food\" promotes disease; tells youth to drink DIRTY MILK for lifelong health", "published": "2017-04-14T04:36:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "uk"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "gmos"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "mike adams"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "national osteoporosis society"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "telegraph"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "big tobacco"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_sejtWCbZc4MoE7EUHucFe2XkQogjQWfmXVbKafYviZVactrm7FyjpN2AS9NkS4cYpkSKu1cpreDGAVYMdfnAhIeJyb60LDj35L3MiYsaz_IuminPJLmnf7umkOesN.W93cJVZmX7dgiCIFjSea3d4", "author": "Mike Adams", "external_links": [], "title": "Dairy industry front group declares eating \"clean food\" promotes disease; tells youth to drink DIRTY MILK for lifelong health", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Not a misprint: MIT press to publish \u201ccommunism for kids\u201d book \nThursday, April 13, 2017 by: News Editors \n( Natural News ) Talk about starting the indoctrination early.

Trump , self-funding , solar panels \n( Natural News ) Though far too many Americans are enamored with the socialism of Sen. Bernie Sanders and our European brethren, one of the things that has always contributed to the wild success of the United States is our free-market economic model. \nThe system we have today is more like crony capitalism , which is based on close cooperation between industry, business and government officials. Nevertheless, elements of our capitalist founding remain and that\u2019s good because capitalism and free markets breed competition, creativity and innovation. \nWhich, in turn, breeds fantastic ideas, like the one proposed by Las Vegas firm Gleason Partners LLC, one of the dozens of companies who have submitted bids to the government to help build President Donald J. Trump\u2019s promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. \nThe idea? Install solar panels all along the wall\u2019s length, so that even if Mexico winds up not paying for the wall, it will pay for itself. (RELATED: Solar panel farm grows 17,000 tons of food without soil, pesticides, fossil fuels or groundwater ) \nAs reported by Lifezette , the panels would generate ample power to supply the needs of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s border operations, and even have plenty left over to sell on the open market. \n\u201cI envision it as a way they can have a revenue source and help pay for the maintenance of the wall and all the surveillance equipment to protect it,\u201d Tom Gleason, a managing partner at the firm, told the website. \u201cYou have to have security for the security, so to speak\u2026 It\u2019s going to be a boost to the economy and pay for itself if it\u2019s done right.\u201d \nAn artist\u2019s rendering of the proposal depicts a \u201cwall\u201d of panels and concrete base. \n(Image: Gleason Partners, LLC) \nAt present at least 200 firms have shown an interest in building the wall, which has become controversial both in the United States and in Mexico. The deadline for submitting bids was April 4. The Associated Press , quoting sources within government, noted that the Trump White House believes somewhere between four and 10 companies will be selected to build prototypes of the wall that will cost between $200,000 \u2013 $500,000 apiece. \nHowever, it is not at all clear that the wall will ever be built. As The National Sentinel reported, Democrats are threatening to shut down the government if Republicans include a $1 billion wall funding request by the Trump administration in a budget that would begin construction of the barrier, which would complete existing barriers that are currently in place in various regions along the border. \nIn reality, this shouldn\u2019t even be an issue and, were it not for Democrats, there would already be a border barrier. In 2006, the GOP-controlled Congress passed, and President George W. Bush signed, legislation calling for a two-tiered fence to be built along a particularly porous 700-mile stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border. \u201cThe Secure Fence Act of 2006\u201d \u201cwill help protect the American people,\u201d Bush said, adding it would \u201cmake our borders more secure\u201d and become \u201can important step toward immigration reform.\u201d \nAfter Democrats took over Congress in 2007, they defunded the legislation (with the help of a Republican senator, Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas). \nNow, the issue seems to be money. \n\u201cThe big chunk of money for the wall, really is \u2026 next fiscal year\u2019s appropriations, because they literally can\u2019t start construction even this quickly,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d recently. \nWe\u2019ll see. We know that the Border Patrol isn\u2019t happy with Ryan\u2019s proposed delay. \n\u201cPresident Trump promised he was going to secure the border, and part of securing the border is putting in place the proper technology and resources that allows us to be successful,\u201d National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judge told Fox Business \u2019 \u201cVarney & Co.\u201d this week, Lifezette reported. \u201cAnd a border wall in strategic locations is one of those things that must get done.\u201d \nFor his part, Gleason would love to see his 30 ft. tall design \u2013 which he estimated would cost between $6 million \u2013 $7.5 million per mile to build\u2013 selected by the White House. (RELATED: Solar roadway panels \u2013 a solution for our economic, energy and environmental troubles? ) \n\u201cIt has a lot of potential,\u201d he told Lifezette , adding that the solar panels would last for at least 25 years. \nAnd \u201cin a way,\u201d he added, \u201cMexico\u2019s going to pay for the wall, because the sun\u2019s coming from south of the border.\u201d \nJ.D.

(I\u2019m not making this up. See the link below\u2026) \nRight on cue, the dishonest mainstream media now decrees clean eating to be a \u201ccult\u201d that could cause horrible disease. Anyone who avoids processed sugar, homogenized milk, pesticide-laden foods or nutritionally-depleted refined starches is now condemned as a \u201ccultist\u201d by the hopelessly dishonest (and nutritionally illiterate) media, which depends on dairy industry advertising for its revenues. \n\u201c[T]he charity said many of those following the trends had no idea that cutting out major food groups could jeopardise their long-term health, with bones still developing in early adulthood,\u201d reports The Telegraph in a dairy industry propaganda piece that demonizes clean food diets. The same article goes on to condemn celebrities \u201cwho have boasted how they have cut out gluten, dairy, grains and refined sugars\u201d as if that\u2019s a horrible sin of some kind. \nPeople who choose to eat clean food are further smeared in the story which somehow equates clean food with a \u201cpoor diet,\u201d explaining: \nA poor diet for those in their teens and early twenties now could see a significant rise in the numbers of people suffering fractures and the complications associated with them in the future. \nThe story goes on to ridiculously equate drinking milk with preventing osteoporosis while insisting that people who eat clean, unprocessed foods are committing nutritional suicide. \nYes, The Telegraph is the same UK-based publication that openly attacks breastfeeding , falsely declaring that breastfeeding does nothing for the IQ of your child while promoting anti-breastfeeding propaganda groups that push infant formula from globalist food conglomerates. The message from The Telegraph ? Human breast milk is BAD for babies, but processed, homogenized cow\u2019s milk is GREAT for children and teens. \nFolks, it doesn\u2019t get any more idiotic than this. The Telegraph has just labeled itself a media \u201cDUNCE\u201d for life (as well as a real danger to the health of UK children who might be negatively influenced by the publisher\u2019s dangerous nutritional illiteracy). If there\u2019s any publication that should be labeled \u201c fake news \u201d on health matters, it\u2019s The Telegraph. And this story was authored by their Health Editor! Fact check: Processed MILK does not equal strong bones \nThe wildly dishonest dairy industry has long attempted to equate drinking milk with developing strong bones while glossing over the cardiovascular risks of consuming a processed, homogenized, pasteurized milk product. \nHere are some truths about milk the dairy industry doesn\u2019t want you to realize: \nTruth #1) Strong bones depend far more on vitamin D than milk.

If you really want calcium and other nutrients , raw food juicing is by far the best way to get more calcium into your diet. The \u201cmilk = calcium\u201d myth is a total fabrication of the dishonest dairy industry, which has about as much scientific credibility as Big Tobacco. \nTruth #5) Most commercial dairy operations are cruel, inhumane animal factories that subject dairy cows to excruciating pain and suffering in order to produce corporate profits. \nTruth #6) Both BLOOD and PUS are legally allowed in commercial milk products. Few consumers know that pasteurized milk contains 150 times higher levels of blood and pus than fresh, raw milk. \nWARNING: Graphic video below, showing the extreme abuse of dairy cows: The dairy industry is totally freaking out that people are learning the truth about \u201cdirty milk\u201d \nAs the truth about the deceptions of the factory-run dairy industry continues to spread across social media, the dairy industry is ramping up its public relations propaganda arm, now trying to scare people into drinking more milk by claiming their bones will break if they don\u2019t. Even more shockingly, by attacking the \u201cclean eating\u201d movement that avoids processed dairy and cheese products, the dairy industry is admitting its products are DIRTY food . \nEven more absurdly, the industry insists that you can only be healthy if you eat sufficient quantities of their \u201cdirty food\u201d which is waning in terms of public demand. \nIt\u2019s already obvious this deceptive P.R. campaign is going to wildly backfire on the dairy industry. Do these corporate morons really believe that they can scare people into drinking more dirty milk by running around screaming that \u201cclean food\u201d is a horribly harmful diet? \nIt\u2019s just laughable. Pathetic, sad and laughable. If anything, all this is yet another great reminder why you should never buy factory produced milk or cheese products again . \nPersonally, I\u2019m a fan of making my own almond milk using a blender, fresh almonds, a nut milk bag and some water. It\u2019s the best-tasting milk in the world, and it\u2019s not produced with hormones, GMOs, pesticides or cruelty. If you want to consume cow\u2019s milk, get whole, fresh RAW cow\u2019s milk from a local farmer (and hope the food police don\u2019t arrest you for the \u201ccrime\u201d of purchasing real food).", "crawled": "2017-04-14T06:49:02.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-14T04:36:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "e8af5d66542c05a8f08817ed94eb63e311cff1ad", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 643, "likes": 643}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 7}}, "country": "US", "site": "naturalnews.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://naturalnews.com/rss.xml", "uuid": "e8af5d66542c05a8f08817ed94eb63e311cff1ad", "section_title": "NaturalNews.com", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 6, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXUmbhBqaECsm7h5AXk2lXXiDlt6YSffExm3pFWq2Zq4PjTY.oAClnQ0bqC36piQzRccy2Xs3LWsT5xa15ZyxYnrllwuEc_twWJOOD8A02vV.86BFW8RgQwtHh6WF.0jAWczphgGXRa.w--", "domain_rank": 6416, "main_image": "http://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2017/04/Dairy-Farm-Milking-Cows.jpg", "site_full": "naturalnews.com", "title_full": "Dairy industry front group declares eating \"clean food\" promotes disease; tells youth to drink DIRTY MILK for lifelong health", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Dairy industry front group declares eating \"clean food\" promotes disease; tells youth to drink DIRTY MILK for lifelong health", "published": "2017-04-14T04:36:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "uk"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "gmos"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "mike adams"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "national osteoporosis society"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "big tobacco"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXUmbhBqaECsm7h5AXk2lXXiDlt6YSffExm3pFWq2Zq4PjTY.oAClnQ0bqC36piQzRccy2Xs3LWsT5xa15ZyxYnrllwuEc_twWJOOD8A02vV.86BFW8RgQwtHh6WF.0jAWczphgGXRa.w--", "author": "Mike Adams", "external_links": [], "title": "Dairy industry front group declares eating \"clean food\" promotes disease; tells youth to drink DIRTY MILK for lifelong health", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Not a misprint: MIT press to publish \u201ccommunism for kids\u201d book \n  News Editors \n( Natural News ) Talk about starting the indoctrination early.

Trump , self-funding , solar panels \n( Natural News ) Though far too many Americans are enamored with the socialism of Sen. Bernie Sanders and our European brethren, one of the things that has always contributed to the wild success of the United States is our free-market economic model. \nThe system we have today is more like crony capitalism , which is based on close cooperation between industry, business and government officials. Nevertheless, elements of our capitalist founding remain and that\u2019s good because capitalism and free markets breed competition, creativity and innovation. \nWhich, in turn, breeds fantastic ideas, like the one proposed by Las Vegas firm Gleason Partners LLC, one of the dozens of companies who have submitted bids to the government to help build President Donald J. Trump\u2019s promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. \nThe idea? Install solar panels all along the wall\u2019s length, so that even if Mexico winds up not paying for the wall, it will pay for itself. (RELATED: Solar panel farm grows 17,000 tons of food without soil, pesticides, fossil fuels or groundwater ) \nAs reported by Lifezette , the panels would generate ample power to supply the needs of the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s border operations, and even have plenty left over to sell on the open market. \n\u201cI envision it as a way they can have a revenue source and help pay for the maintenance of the wall and all the surveillance equipment to protect it,\u201d Tom Gleason, a managing partner at the firm, told the website. \u201cYou have to have security for the security, so to speak\u2026 It\u2019s going to be a boost to the economy and pay for itself if it\u2019s done right.\u201d \nAn artist\u2019s rendering of the proposal depicts a \u201cwall\u201d of panels and concrete base. \n(Image: Gleason Partners, LLC) \nAt present at least 200 firms have shown an interest in building the wall, which has become controversial both in the United States and in Mexico. The deadline for submitting bids was April 4. The Associated Press , quoting sources within government, noted that the Trump White House believes somewhere between four and 10 companies will be selected to build prototypes of the wall that will cost between $200,000 \u2013 $500,000 apiece. \nHowever, it is not at all clear that the wall will ever be built. As The National Sentinel reported, Democrats are threatening to shut down the government if Republicans include a $1 billion wall funding request by the Trump administration in a budget that would begin construction of the barrier, which would complete existing barriers that are currently in place in various regions along the border. \nIn reality, this shouldn\u2019t even be an issue and, were it not for Democrats, there would already be a border barrier. In 2006, the GOP-controlled Congress passed, and President George W. Bush signed, legislation calling for a two-tiered fence to be built along a particularly porous 700-mile stretch of the U.S.-Mexico border. \u201cThe Secure Fence Act of 2006\u201d \u201cwill help protect the American people,\u201d Bush said, adding it would \u201cmake our borders more secure\u201d and become \u201can important step toward immigration reform.\u201d \nAfter Democrats took over Congress in 2007, they defunded the legislation (with the help of a Republican senator, Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas). \nNow, the issue seems to be money. \n\u201cThe big chunk of money for the wall, really is \u2026 next fiscal year\u2019s appropriations, because they literally can\u2019t start construction even this quickly,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., told \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d recently. \nWe\u2019ll see. We know that the Border Patrol isn\u2019t happy with Ryan\u2019s proposed delay. \n\u201cPresident Trump promised he was going to secure the border, and part of securing the border is putting in place the proper technology and resources that allows us to be successful,\u201d National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judge told Fox Business \u2019 \u201cVarney & Co.\u201d this week, Lifezette reported. \u201cAnd a border wall in strategic locations is one of those things that must get done.\u201d \nFor his part, Gleason would love to see his 30 ft. tall design \u2013 which he estimated would cost between $6 million \u2013 $7.5 million per mile to build\u2013 selected by the White House. (RELATED: Solar roadway panels \u2013 a solution for our economic, energy and environmental troubles? ) \n\u201cIt has a lot of potential,\u201d he told Lifezette , adding that the solar panels would last for at least 25 years. \nAnd \u201cin a way,\u201d he added, \u201cMexico\u2019s going to pay for the wall, because the sun\u2019s coming from south of the border.\u201d \nJ.D.

Please try again later. Close Women explain why they chose double mastectomies despite having cancer in only one breast \u2014 or even in neither breast. \nMore women are opting to remove both breasts when cancer is found in only one. \nThe proportion of patients aged 45 and older who had contralateral prophylactic mastectomies rose from 3 percent in 2004 to 10 percent in 2012, according to a study published in JAMA Surgery. \nAmong women aged 20 to 44, it jumped from 10 percent to 33 percent. \nRemoving the unaffected breast does reduce the risk of cancer in that breast. However, for women at average risk, the chance of cancer developing in the other breast is small. \nIn addition, the surgery has not been shown to help those women live longer. \nSo, why do they do it? Genetic testing \nAs genetic testing becomes more common, we know more than ever about our health risks. \nBRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic mutations are associated with increased risk of breast and other cancers. Testing helps women understand the risks of developing specific types of cancer, as well as whether they can pass the mutations on to their children. \nIt also helps in choosing treatment options or taking preventive measures. \nOne of those preventive measures is prophylactic mastectomy. \nFor women who carry the BRCA mutations or have a strong family history of breast cancer, the surgery may reduce the risk of developing breast cancer by 90 to 95 percent . \nTesting is one thing. Interpreting the results is another. \nA recent survey of more than 2,000 newly diagnosed women found that half who had a double mastectomy after genetic testing didn\u2019t actually have mutations that increase the risk of additional cancers. \nThey had variants of uncertain significance (VUS), which are often harmless. \nAbout half the women who had genetic testing never spoke to a genetic counselor about the results. \nBetween one-quarter and one-half of breast cancer surgeons surveyed said they treat women with VUS the same way they treat women with known cancer-associated mutations. \nSome women have the surgery before they ever get the results. Or before being tested at all. Why they do it \nAt 45 years old, Charlotte Gajewski of Texas was diagnosed with stage 0 DCIS. \n\u201cIt sounded simple enough,\u201d she wrote in an email to Healthline. \u201cBut after two lumpectomies, they continued to find more positive margins with cancer cells speckled throughout my breast in a shotgun pattern.\u201d \nShe tested negative for the BRCA genetic mutations and had no family history of breast cancer. \nAn MRI of the unaffected breast revealed a flat tumor. It was non-threatening but would need to be monitored. What sounded like a simple and \u2018dream\u2019 diagnosis turned into quite a fiasco for me. Charlotte Gajewski, breast cancer patient \n\u201cSo I elected to have a mastectomy and, ultimately, a bilateral mastectomy,\u201d said Gajewski. \nHer doctor explained the pros and cons of the surgery. Her only hesitation was whether or not to spare the nipple on the unaffected breast. \nShe chose radical mastectomy on both so she wouldn\u2019t have to live with doubts and fears of recurrence. \nShe\u2019s happy with her decision but says she has no feeling or sensation across her entire chest, which is both annoying and a constant reminder of what she went through. \n\u201cWhat sounded like a simple and \u2018dream\u2019 diagnosis turned into quite a fiasco for me. But life is good now and I am healthy and joyful every day,\u201d said Gajewski. \nMari Gallion, 47, is an author living in Alaska. \nFollowing the diagnosis of triple-negative breast cancer , her doctor suggested breast-conserving surgery in the affected breast. \nHowever, the first lumpectomy failed to get clear margins. The second, third, and fourth lumpectomies were also unsuccessful. It no longer made sense to keep trying to save the breast, even though she tested negative for BRCA mutations. \nTogether with her surgeon, she decided on a double mastectomy despite having cancer in only one breast. There were moments that I wished I hadn't opted for reconstruction because of the pain and the time off work. Mari Gallion, breast cancer patient \nThe most important consideration was her health, she told Healthline. \n\u201cEarly in the process, should mastectomy have become a reality, I was considering foregoing reconstruction when it was just one breast,\u201d Gallion said. \u201cMy mom had a prosthetic, so I wasn't afraid of that, but if two were being removed, I wanted them both done.\u201d \nGallion feels fortunate that she was able to have the mastectomy and immediate reconstruction without the need for tissue expanders. \nNot that it was easy. \nShe called the first four weeks after mastectomy \u201chorrifying.\u201d \n\u201cThere were moments that I wished I hadn't opted for reconstruction because of the pain and the time off work,\u201d she said. \u201cI had six surgeries all together, one of them three weeks after the mastectomy to remove the nipple, as there was a positive margin on my nipple. I understand it can be just as painful without the reconstruction. I was concerned about taking too many opioids, as I was literally watching the clock to see when I was allowed to take another pill. However, I am extremely happy with the result.\u201d \n\u201cThey [my breasts] are kind of crazy looking in that one doesn't have a nipple, but I like that I can wear all my old clothes,\u201d continued Gallion. \nShe\u2019s considering getting a 3-D tattoo in place of the missing nipple. Mastectomy despite not having breast cancer \nComedian Caitlin Brodnick has never been diagnosed with breast cancer. \nBut she had a double mastectomy anyway. \nSome of her reasoning was based on her childhood. Her father\u2019s entire immediate family died of various cancers, including breast cancer. \n\u201cGrowing up, I was convinced I would get cancer. I was really afraid,\u201d Brodnick told Healthline. \u201cI was born just nine months after my aunt died of cancer. It was completely devastating and my whole family was anxious about health and cancer as a direct result.\u201d \nAt 28 years old, she tested for BRCA mutations. \nThe result was positive. Growing up, I was convinced I would get cancer. I was really afraid. Caitlin Brodnick, comedian \nTo Brodnick, it felt like a cancer diagnosis. In fact, she refers to it as a diagnosis. \n\u201cThe official diagnosis and knowing I had the genetic mutation was scary. I thought it would be easier to have something you clearly knew how to fight. The idea that you\u2019re more likely to get cancer is very vague. You have to continually test and see doctors for screening. You\u2019re on the defense and it\u2019s maddening. You don\u2019t know if cancer is lurking around the corner,\u201d she explained. \nBrodnick credits actress Angelina Jolie with jumpstarting the preventive mastectomy conversation. Jolie, who carries the BRCA1 genetic mutation, went public following her preventive double mastectomy in 2013. \n\u201cDoctors are cautious because they don\u2019t want patients to have a mastectomy as a gut emotional response without thinking it through,\u201d said Brodnick. \nDoctors didn\u2019t push the decision on her. \nShe came to it on her own after discussing it with her husband and other family members. \nShe\u2019d never had a major surgery before, so there was a lot of pre-op anxiety. \n\u201cThe minute I woke up after surgery I felt total relief,\u201d she said. \nShe also had implants. The size didn\u2019t work out, so the procedure had to be repeated. Other than that, there haven\u2019t been any post-surgical complications. \n\u201cI had no idea I\u2019d feel this great. Three years later, I\u2019m strong and healthy.\u201d \nAs satisfied as she is with her own decisions, she knows it\u2019s not for everyone. \n\u201cA close friend had breast cancer at a young age and had a mastectomy. It was traumatic for her. Reconstructed breasts won\u2019t ever be like real breasts,\u201d she said. \nRead more: Breast cancer treatment options by stage \u00bb A breast surgeon\u2019s point of view \nDr. Diane M. Radford is staff breast surgical oncologist at Cleveland Clinic and medical director of the breast program at Cleveland Clinic Hillcrest Hospital. \nWhen counseling patients with cancer in one breast, she follows the consensus statement from the American Society of Breast Surgeons and the Choosing Wisely guidelines. \n\u201cI counsel women about the lack of survival benefit with CPM (contralateral prophylactic mastectomy) and increased risk of complications such as bleeding and infection,\u201d she wrote in an email to Healthline. \n\u201cIn patients in high risk groups, such as BRCA gene carriers, the risk to the other breast is high enough to warrant CPM. My approach is evidence-based, and I review the pros and cons,\u201d she said. \u201cWhile CPM is the best risk reduction we can offer (about 95 percent risk reduction), the risk of cancer in the other breast is small in average risk women \u2014 0.2 to 0.5 percent per year for those undergoing adjuvant therapies.\u201d If in my opinion the patient will be extremely anxious about risk to the other breast, then for quality of life, I would perform [the surgery]. Dr. Diane M. Radford, Cleveland Clinic Hillcrest Hospital \nNo surgery is risk-free. \n\u201cThe risk of bleeding is about 1 percent and the risk of infection is also about 1 percent,\u201d said Radford. \u201cSo if both breasts are removed those risks rise to 2 percent and 2 percent. There is debate on whether to routinely perform sentient node biopsy for CPM. I do not routinely perform sentient node biopsy for CPM, therefore there is theoretically no risk of lymphedema with CPM.\u201d \nMedical decisions often involve more than statistics and probabilities. \nThere\u2019s also a quality of life issue. \nRadford explained that if, after counseling, a woman at average risk for contralateral cancer wishes CPM, she would agree to do it. \n\u201cThe consensus statement states that CPM also may be appropriate for women with other conditions such as dense breasts, recall fatigue, concern about reconstruction symmetry, and extreme disease-related anxiety,\u201d she said. \u201cIf in my opinion the patient will be extremely anxious about risk to the other breast, then for quality of life, I would perform CPM.\u201d 1 Was this article helpful?

Matt Damon's young daughter reportedly had this painful experience earlier this week. According to the Courier Mail , Damon and his wife and kids were vacationing with Chris Hemsworth's family at the Thor star's home in Byron Bay, New South Wales, when 6-year-old Stella was stung. \nLuckily, it sounds like Stella received swift care. Her dad rushed to a nearby cafe for ice, and paramedics treated Stella at the beach. The incident is a good reminder that quick action can help diminish the symptoms of a sting. Here, Health 's contributing medical editor, Dr. Raj , shares four tips on what to do\u2014plus what not to do\u2014should you or a loved one have a run-in with a jelly. \nRELATED: 5 Times You Really, Seriously Need to Go to the ER 1. Remove the stingers \nYour first step should be to try to clear away the pieces of tentacle embedded in your skin as quickly as possible. If they're right on the surface, you might be able to gently rinse them off with salt water ( not fresh water, though\u2014more on this later). You could also try scraping off stingers with the edge of a credit card, says Dr. Raj . 2. Deactivate the venom \nWash the area with vinegar. Or make a paste with baking soda and seawater (again, not fresh) and gently apply it to the wound. \nTo get our best tips delivered to you inbox, sign up for   3. Treat the pain \nTake a pain reliever to ease the discomfort. A hot pack or immersing the wound in hot water may also help. A 2016 review published in the journal Toxins suggests heat is a more effective treatment than cold . \"[R]esearch to date has shown that all marine venoms are highly heat sensitive, thus hot water or hot packs should be more effective than cold packs or ice,\" study author Christie Wilcox said in a press release. 4. Watch for severe symptoms \nAlthough a jellyfish sting can be incredibly painful, most stings don't require a trip to the ER. Dr. Raj says that if symptoms appear under control after you've completed the steps above, you may not need any further treatment. But if you notice signs of an allergic reaction , or symptoms are severe\u2014think nausea, dizziness, fever, or difficulty breathing\u2014you should get medical attention immediately. It's also worth seeing a doctor ASAP if the sting is near the eye. What not to do \nDon't rinse the wound with fresh water. While it's okay for salt water to touch the area, fresh water can actually activate jellyfish stingers. Dr. Raj warns against rubbing the wound with a towel, or splashing around in seawater, which could also activate stingers. \nAnd no, you definitely shouldn't reenact that famous Friends scene : Experts agree that urine doesn't have the chemical makeup to neutralize jellyfish venom the way vinegar does.", "crawled": "2017-04-14T04:09:28.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-14T04:09:28.000+03:00", "uuid": "f2c92327ff5ff3377dc0308babf2dd97c2a8fa05", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 849, "likes": 849}, "gplus": {"shares": 7}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 10}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "health.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.health.com/health/healthy-happy/feed", "uuid": "f2c92327ff5ff3377dc0308babf2dd97c2a8fa05", "section_title": "Mind & Body - Health.com", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 8, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOju9uOXaACQ56o8sJmcIKUcCAyKXSS4WjqSOkTMsL13flKiPbQxP1Xe225Ank37N_PQ--", "domain_rank": 2290, "main_image": "http://cdn-img.health.com/sites/default/files/styles/master_2_1/public/1492096286/GettyImages-521338251.jpg?itok=56_euf79", "site_full": "www.health.com", "title_full": "4 Things You Need to Do Immediately If You\u2019re Stung by a Jellyfish", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "4 Things You Need to Do Immediately If You\u2019re Stung by a Jellyfish", "published": "2017-04-14T04:09:28.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "new south wales"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "neutral", "name": "matt damon"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "chris hemsworth"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "damon"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "byron bay"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "christie wilcox"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "courier mail"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "stella"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "raj"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "toxins"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_H.WjP9ajOju9uOXaACQ56o8sJmcIKUcCAyKXSS4WjqSOkTMsL13flKiPbQxP1Xe225Ank37N_PQ--", "author": "Health", "external_links": [], "title": "4 Things You Need to Do Immediately If You\u2019re Stung by a Jellyfish", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Watch More Videos > \nUnlike most \u201980s kids, I didn\u2019t grow up watching Star Wars . It wasn\u2019t until a few years ago, when I saw Rey in Episode VII: The Force Awakens , that I really understood the full impact of the franchise \u2014 and fell in love with its not-so-subtle girl-power message. Rey is everything a female hero should be, and I was so proud watching my daughter\u2019s face light up as she came on to the big screen. She\u2019s exactly the kind of role model I want for my little girl: strong, fearless, and independent, yet loyal and kind. \nAnd now, Lucasfilm Animation, which is owned by Disney, is expanding the influence of Rey and other strong female characters \u2014 like Jyn from Rogue One and the iconic Princess Leia \u2014 with a new series of animated short films, entitled Star Wars: Forces of Destiny . According to a recent press release, the episodes will be appearing this July, on Disney\u2019s YouTube channel . Image Source: Lucasfilm/The Walt Disney Company \nOur girls already idolize the heck out of these strong women (as they should!). But soon, thanks to the storytelling wizards at Lucasfilm Animation, audiences will go beyond the stories we already know, and learn what shaped the destinies of Rey, Jyn Erso, Ahsoka Tano, Sabine Wren, Princess Leia, and others. (Similar to how the already popular series Star Wars: The Clone Wars fills in gaps and answers fans\u2019 questions about different storylines and characters.) Fans will also recognize familiar voices they\u2019ve grown to love, as Daisy Ridley, Felicity Jones, and Lupita Nyong\u2019o will all reprise their famous roles of Rey, Jyn, and Maz. \nBut that\u2019s not all \u2014 to accompany the release of the animated micro-series this summer, Disney is also rolling out a new line of action figures, so Star Wars fans can reenact scenes with their very own Rey, Jyn, and Leia dolls (plus some lovable sidekicks, like BB8 and Chewbacca!). And since these ladies are fighters, after all, they\u2019ll come equipped with their very own extendable staffs, blasters, and lightsabers. A new line of books will also focus on characters like Padme Amidala and Sabine Wren, with narration by Maz Kanata as storyteller. Image Source: Lucasfilm/The Walt Disney Company \n\u201c Star Wars: Forces of Destiny is for anyone who has been inspired by Leia\u2019s heroism, Rey\u2019s courage, or Ahsoka\u2019s tenacity,\u201d said Kathleen Kennedy, President of Lucasfilm, in a press release. \nAfter all, just one of the many reasons the Star Wars dynasty struck such a chord, notes Kennedy, is that kids grow up seeing themselves in these characters. With Forces of Destiny , young fans are now given the rare opportunity of hearing untold stories of some of their most beloved characters. And they can rest assured that Lucasfilm promises to maintain the accuracy of the Star Wars storyline within each 2-3 minute films. \nAs someone who\u2019s grown to love Star Wars in my adult years, I\u2019m grateful to be raising my kids as fans from Day 1. And I am proud when my daughter idolizes the strength and courage of Leia, Jyn, and Rey, or tells a story like Maz. I look forward to enjoying these short films and reading the Forces of Destiny books together; and you bet my daughter is going to get each and every one of these new action figures. With role models like Rey, Jyn, and Leia, my daughter believes that she too can be brave as she lives out her own destiny.

Recently, three middle school students were quarantined at school until a parent or guardian came to take them home. Why? Because the adolescents had not received the HPV vaccine \u2014 a questionable-at-best injection that has proven itself to be capable of grievous harm. \nEarlier this year, it was revealed that over 100 women and girls in Japan had launched lawsuits against their government and two HPV vaccine manufacturers \u2014 GlaxoSmithKline and Merck \u2014 due to the harmful effects the immunizations had on their health. Some of the major health conditions the women developed include chronic pain, impaired mobility and severe menstrual pain. One young woman, Erina Sonoda, reports that while she was perfectly healthy prior to receiving the Cervarix vaccine, by the end of the three rounds of injections, she needed a cane to walk. The 20-year-old says that after the second injection, she developed horrible menstrual pain \u2014 and by the third, the pain had spread to her entire body. When Sonoda is not able to walk with a cane, she uses a wheelchair. \nClearly, the Rhode Island girls have good reasons to abstain from the HPV vaccine, even if their school system disagrees with them. Gardasil, the other HPV vaccine, has been attributed to a number of ill effects, including paralysis and brain damage . \nLast year, the coastal state came under fire for deciding to mandate that all 7th-grade children needed to have the HPV vaccine, regardless of gender. Dr. Ailis Clyne, director of the Rhode Island Department of Health\u2019s Immunization Program, states that 7th graders need to have had one dose of the inoculation, while 8th graders will need to have had two. \nUnsurprisingly, a number of Rhode Island parents objected to the vaccine mandate, with concerns ranging from personal to religious reasons. Medical and religious exemptions are allowed, and at the time, schools were encouraged \u201cnot to ask questions\u201d even if parents had not submitted exemption forms. That viewpoint, however, seems to have changed. \nOn April 10, 2017, three girls at a Coventry middle school were removed from their first period classes and detained in the office until someone came to pick them up from school. Apparently, the children were not even allowed to use the restroom. Two of the girls claimed to have gotten the vaccine, but because the school did not have the appropriate paperwork, they were sent home anyways. \nOne student, Savannah, did an interview with Dan Bidondi of Truth Radio Show. Savannah says that the school had sent home letters and made phone calls to tell her family that if she did not get the vaccine, she would be sent home. According to Bidondi, the Department of Health had previously stated students would not be made to miss school over the vaccine mandate. \nThe Rhode Islanders Against Mandated HPV Vaccinations group had previously argued that there was no point in a vaccine mandate that would not be enforced, and that this was reason enough for the mandate to be revoked. It seems that at least the Coventry district has devised a response to these assertions, though it is not the answer the anti-mandatory vaccine group had hoped for. Instead of removing the mandate, students who are not vaccinated are apparently going to be removed. \nSavannah says that her school principal said that the order to remove her and the other two girls from class was not the school\u2019s decision, and that the order had been handed down from the superintendent because it was a \u201cstate law.\u201d Savannah will not be able to return to school without a doctor\u2019s appointment or a completed exemption form. \nThis is an obvious violation of parental rights \u2014 and a violation of children\u2019s rights. As Bidondi points out, the state law regarding the HPV vaccine explicitly notes that children should not be made to miss school over the vaccine. \nGet more news on the dangers of vaccines at Vaccines.news", "crawled": "2017-04-13T21:37:37.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-13T18:15:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "65d1e98a27541f2e11d7266cac9e829beb28560d", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 871, "likes": 871}, "gplus": {"shares": 14}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 9}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}}, "country": "US", "site": "naturalnews.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.naturalnews.com/rss.xml", "uuid": "65d1e98a27541f2e11d7266cac9e829beb28560d", "section_title": "NaturalNews.com", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 8, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_sejtWCbZc4MoE7EUHucFe2XkQogjQWfkqt7nkYwC5PM5V9RvrXaBro6iIUuCU..Ya4wxaChLKhhgjVjLm.Q.m9RIeidtMg8hEDnv4YoPTUKCzxGQHAKHl_9vYxw4OVe.5WbxdPjTD7665MhJBLUfn", "domain_rank": 6416, "main_image": "http://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2017/04/Vaccine-Syringe-Hand-Medical-HPV.jpg", "site_full": "www.naturalnews.com", "title_full": "Rhode Island student kicked out of school for refusing the HPV vaccine", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Rhode Island student kicked out of school for refusing the HPV vaccine", "published": "2017-04-13T18:15:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "rhode island"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "savannah"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "japan"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "coventry"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "erina sonoda"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ailis clyne"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "vicki batts"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "sonoda"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dan bidondi"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "bidondi"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "rhode island department of health"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "glaxosmithkline"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "rhode islanders against mandated hpv vaccinations"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "gardasil"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "department of health"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "coventry"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "truth radio show"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "merck"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_sejtWCbZc4MoE7EUHucFe2XkQogjQWfkqt7nkYwC5PM5V9RvrXaBro6iIUuCU..Ya4wxaChLKhhgjVjLm.Q.m9RIeidtMg8hEDnv4YoPTUKCzxGQHAKHl_9vYxw4OVe.5WbxdPjTD7665MhJBLUfn", "author": "Vicki Batts", "external_links": [], "title": "Rhode Island student kicked out of school for refusing the HPV vaccine", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "TWISTED: According to bizarre Pentagon logic, Russia can now bomb the USA to stop vaccine violence against children \nThursday, April 13, 2017 by: Mike Adams Tags: act of war , chemical violence , chemical weapons , children , gas attack , ingredients , mercury , Pentagon , Syria , vaccine violence \n( Natural News ) If you really look deeply at the \u201cmoral justification\u201d behind the recent U.S. military strike in Syria, it all comes down to this simple argument: \u201cThose children were being hurt by chemical violence, and we just HAD to do something to stop them!\u201d \nTherefore, according to the Pentagon, anytime a nation anywhere in the world believes another nation is doing something to harm its children with chemicals, they have the right to launch missile strikes, drop bombs or do anything necessary to stop what they see as an \u201cchemical violence\u201d against children. \nNo declaration of war is required.

This includes kinetic violence, abusive verbal violence, chemical violence and vaccine violence. My hope is that future children can grow up in a world where they are not poisoned by weed killer herbicides in their food, toxic pesticides in the drinking water or brain-damaging heavy metals in vaccines. \nI want children to be safe from all forms of violence, including medical violence and vaccine violence.

Recently, three middle school students were quarantined at school until a parent or guardian came to take them home. Why? Because the adolescents had not received the HPV vaccine \u2014 a questionable-at-best injection that has proven itself to be capable of grievous harm. \nEarlier this year, it was revealed that over 100 women and girls in Japan had launched lawsuits against their government and two HPV vaccine manufacturers \u2014 GlaxoSmithKline and Merck \u2014 due to the harmful effects the immunizations had on their health. Some of the major health conditions the women developed include chronic pain, impaired mobility and severe menstrual pain. One young woman, Erina Sonoda, reports that while she was perfectly healthy prior to receiving the Cervarix vaccine, by the end of the three rounds of injections, she needed a cane to walk. The 20-year-old says that after the second injection, she developed horrible menstrual pain \u2014 and by the third, the pain had spread to her entire body. When Sonoda is not able to walk with a cane, she uses a wheelchair. \nClearly, the Rhode Island girls have good reasons to abstain from the HPV vaccine, even if their school system disagrees with them. Gardasil, the other HPV vaccine, has been attributed to a number of ill effects, including paralysis and brain damage . \nLast year, the coastal state came under fire for deciding to mandate that all 7th-grade children needed to have the HPV vaccine, regardless of gender. Dr. Ailis Clyne, director of the Rhode Island Department of Health\u2019s Immunization Program, states that 7th graders need to have had one dose of the inoculation, while 8th graders will need to have had two. \nUnsurprisingly, a number of Rhode Island parents objected to the vaccine mandate, with concerns ranging from personal to religious reasons. Medical and religious exemptions are allowed, and at the time, schools were encouraged \u201cnot to ask questions\u201d even if parents had not submitted exemption forms. That viewpoint, however, seems to have changed. \nOn April 10, 2017, three girls at a Coventry middle school were removed from their first period classes and detained in the office until someone came to pick them up from school. Apparently, the children were not even allowed to use the restroom. Two of the girls claimed to have gotten the vaccine, but because the school did not have the appropriate paperwork, they were sent home anyways. \nOne student, Savannah, did an interview with Dan Bidondi of Truth Radio Show. Savannah says that the school had sent home letters and made phone calls to tell her family that if she did not get the vaccine, she would be sent home. According to Bidondi, the Department of Health had previously stated students would not be made to miss school over the vaccine mandate. \nThe Rhode Islanders Against Mandated HPV Vaccinations group had previously argued that there was no point in a vaccine mandate that would not be enforced, and that this was reason enough for the mandate to be revoked. It seems that at least the Coventry district has devised a response to these assertions, though it is not the answer the anti-mandatory vaccine group had hoped for. Instead of removing the mandate, students who are not vaccinated are apparently going to be removed. \nSavannah says that her school principal said that the order to remove her and the other two girls from class was not the school\u2019s decision, and that the order had been handed down from the superintendent because it was a \u201cstate law.\u201d Savannah will not be able to return to school without a doctor\u2019s appointment or a completed exemption form. \nThis is an obvious violation of parental rights \u2014 and a violation of children\u2019s rights. As Bidondi points out, the state law regarding the HPV vaccine explicitly notes that children should not be made to miss school over the vaccine. \nGet more news on the dangers of vaccines at Vaccines.news", "crawled": "2017-04-13T19:28:13.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-13T18:15:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "9efc81a8b228107bc05e3b6b5c7b85f0740517ec", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 871, "likes": 871}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}}, "country": "US", "site": "naturalnews.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://naturalnews.com/rss.xml", "uuid": "9efc81a8b228107bc05e3b6b5c7b85f0740517ec", "section_title": "NaturalNews.com", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 8, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXUmbhBqaECsm7h5AXk2lXXiDlt6YSffEwDoVoEZczZqfS2ikPS6DRfGNzzZuXFoC7187DDnEMOMS40zqKav_cnVfuvpoNWXogylUaBhXiLhbsxgaKZu_wtYDGV_9jvHzKI.7ASx1Ghrg--", "domain_rank": 6416, "main_image": "http://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2017/04/Vaccine-Syringe-Hand-Medical-HPV.jpg", "site_full": "naturalnews.com", "title_full": "Rhode Island student kicked out of school for refusing the HPV vaccine", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Rhode Island student kicked out of school for refusing the HPV vaccine", "published": "2017-04-13T18:15:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "rhode island"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "savannah"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "japan"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "coventry"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "erina sonoda"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ailis clyne"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "vicki batts"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "sonoda"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dan bidondi"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "bidondi"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "rhode island department of health"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "glaxosmithkline"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "rhode islanders against mandated hpv vaccinations"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "gardasil"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "department of health"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "coventry"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "truth radio show"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "merck"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXUmbhBqaECsm7h5AXk2lXXiDlt6YSffEwDoVoEZczZqfS2ikPS6DRfGNzzZuXFoC7187DDnEMOMS40zqKav_cnVfuvpoNWXogylUaBhXiLhbsxgaKZu_wtYDGV_9jvHzKI.7ASx1Ghrg--", "author": "Vicki Batts", "external_links": [], "title": "Rhode Island student kicked out of school for refusing the HPV vaccine", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Judge orders FORCED VACCINATIONS for children in shocking UK court case \n  Vicki Batts Tags: forced vaccination , UK , Vaccine dangers \n( Natural News ) Freedom has taken another crushing blow in the UK as a High Court judge ruled that a mother can\u2019t do what she believes is best for her children \u2014 but only because her beliefs don\u2019t go along with their preordained narrative of what defines a child\u2019s \u201cbest interests.\u201d \nThe mother in question did not want to vaccinate her children in part, because they are vegans and current vaccine development methods do not align with the family\u2019s personal beliefs (they contain animal blood components and DNA). The mother also cited concerns about toxic ingredients often found in vaccines, such as aluminum salts, as part of why she opposed getting her children vaccinated. According to the mother, her oldest son had already experienced side effects from previous shots such as \u201ccradle cap, a persistent cough and eczema.\u201d \nHowever, this story is not just a case of courts versus a loving mother. The children\u2019s father brought the mother to court over her refusal to vaccinate the kids, and applied for a court order to force vaccination upon them. The father says that he did this out of concern for his sons\u2019 safety, and claims that the mother is \u201cobsessive, overprotective and narrow in her views.\u201d \nBut who is really being narrow-minded here?

One might wonder if refusing to acknowledge \u201cdissenting\u201d information on the topic of vaccines \u2014 and at least take it with a grain of salt \u2014 is what is truly narrow . \nThe father went on to say that the mom had a \u201csuspicion of all conventional medicine,\u201d and illustrated this claim by describing how in the past, she had refused to give her sons paracetamol-based medicines. Paracetamol is the British term for what we in the states call \u201cacetaminophen.\u201d However, these concerns are not unfounded: Acetaminophen has been shown to sometimes cause liver damage, even when consumed in the recommended amounts as instructed by the label. In 2013, it was estimated that some 80,000 people a year are hospitalized due to acetaminophen poisoning and another 500 or so would die from liver complications. So, how is this not a valid concern? \nThe boys\u2019 mother defended her beliefs in court and stated, \u201cIt is not natural to be injected with metal elements and as a vegan, it goes against my beliefs for my children to be injected with something that is grown on animal cells or something that has been tested on animals.\u201d \nShe also stated, \u201cWhat I have learned is that yes, vaccines do work some of the time, but there is a definite risk with vaccination. The vaccine manufacturers have cited that vaccines are \u2018unavoidably unsafe.'\u201d The UK mom, who has not been named to protect the anonymity of the kids, went on to describe how her boys are very healthy children and that their risk of disease is low because they have strong immune systems that help to protect them against illness. \nSadly, but yet unsurprisingly, the father\u2019s attempts at making the mother sound \u201cparanoid,\u201d prevailed. The High Court Judge Mark Rogers cited the UK\u2019s Children\u2019s Act of 1989, which allows the court to \u201coverrule a parent\u201d for the sake of the child\u2019s \u201cwelfare.\u201d Natural Blaze reports that vaccines do not appear in any of the headlines for the legislation, though that made little difference in the outcome. \nRogers noted that the mother was unable to find a doctor to support her views that was willing to appear in front of the courts on her behalf. To do so, naturally, would have been career suicide for any doctor \u2014 or at the very least, it would have opened them up to quite a bit of scrutiny. He even went on to say that he was \u201csorry\u201d that the mother would view his ruling as being \u201cwrong,\u201d and questioned her ability to view the matter \u201cobjectively.\u201d \nForced vaccination will never be the right course of action. Vaccines do come with risks , regardless of whether or not mainstream medicine puppets are willing to recognize it \u2014 facts are facts. Vaccines are not only made with animal-derived ingredients, but they are often tested on animals. To make matters worse, many vaccines contain toxic adjuvants such as aluminum salts, which are known to cause a wide range of deleterious effects . \nThis issue will not be going away anytime soon, and as more people wake up to the dangers of vaccines, we will likely begin to see more court-mandated vaccination cases. \nSources:", "crawled": "2017-04-13T17:36:17.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-13T04:48:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "14716db8959eda9997283cde0cab34261bf8b94b", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 598, "likes": 598}, "gplus": {"shares": 6}, "vk": {"shares": 1}, "pinterest": {"shares": 9}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}}, "country": "US", "site": "naturalnews.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.naturalnews.com/rss.xml", "uuid": "14716db8959eda9997283cde0cab34261bf8b94b", "section_title": "NaturalNews.com", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 5, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_sejtWCbZc4MoE7EUHucFe2XkQogjQWfmQwRToA74UKc09sHwAyW5dRMOaU0dpVlz.CS1YSzOEf1bduU8csobaFSgD9_xe_cRVRC0HZsv9TgoCDJQxTpjDsp36f6iVlN6SRTzLUwlK1Ddn4vYUnvQZ", "domain_rank": 6416, "main_image": "http://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2017/04/Healthcare-Vaccine-Nurse-Syringe-Shot-Needle.jpg", "site_full": "www.naturalnews.com", "title_full": "Judge orders FORCED VACCINATIONS for children in shocking UK court case", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Judge orders FORCED VACCINATIONS for children in shocking UK court case", "published": "2017-04-13T04:48:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_sejtWCbZc4MoE7EUHucFe2XkQogjQWfmQwRToA74UKc09sHwAyW5dRMOaU0dpVlz.CS1YSzOEf1bduU8csobaFSgD9_xe_cRVRC0HZsv9TgoCDJQxTpjDsp36f6iVlN6SRTzLUwlK1Ddn4vYUnvQZ", "author": "Vicki Batts", "external_links": [], "title": "Judge orders FORCED VACCINATIONS for children in shocking UK court case", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Organic seed market explodes, sales predicted to hit $5.4B by 2024 \n  Isabelle Z. Tags: farming , organic food , organic seeds \n( Natural News ) It wasn\u2019t too long ago that organic food was considered to be a luxury. Its high prices made it something that only the most devout health nuts and those with deeper pockets were willing to shell out for. Now, however, organic food is quickly becoming a necessity for those who want a long and healthy life. The price difference between organic and non-organic is not as pronounced as it once was as the supply increases, and more and more people are finding the higher price tag a very small price to pay to avoid eating chemical pesticide-laden food. \nA look at the current trends in the seed market illustrates this growing demand perfectly. A new report by Global Market Insights, Inc. predicts that the size of the organic seed market will reach $5.4 billion by the year 2024. Shifting consumer preferences toward natural food and increased awareness about its health benefits are pushing the demand for organic seeds to new heights. \nIt\u2019s not just the health benefits that are driving people to go completely organic, however. Eschewing pesticides can help preserve agricultural biodiversity and even prevent social injustices against farmers in some countries. In addition, organic food simply tastes better. People who have eaten fruits and vegetables just as nature intended them find them to be far more flavorful than their non-organic counterparts. \nThe report singles out a few countries in particular as driving the growth in organic seed sales: The U.S., Germany, China, Malaysia, Indonesia and India. The organic seed market for crops in the U.S. alone was worth in excess of $460 million in 2015, while many European countries are seeing advanced farming technology and supply chain improvements that are supporting organic product growth. An increase in disposable income in some of these areas is also helping to fuel the demand. \nAnother factor that is helping spur this growth of organic seed sales , according to the report, is the implementation of more supportive governmental regulations that encourage farming without chemicals. For example, in the U.S., a new plan was recently unveiled that allows farmers to sell their products under the \u201cTransitional\u201d label while undergoing the costly and time-consuming transition to fully organic. Many have been reluctant to make the switch in the past because of the prospect of massive lost revenue during the transitional years. \nWhen it comes to types of organic seeds, vegetables will account for more than $1.8 billion of the sales growth by 2024 thanks to their higher nutritional value, antioxidant properties and ease of digestion.

Nancy Kerrigan on Feeling Like a \u201cFailure\u201d After Miscarrying 6 Times Karen Johnson Image Source: ABC Television \nIf you ask your mom or grandma about miscarriages and fertility issues from years ago, they may say it didn\u2019t happen \u201cback then.\u201d Or at least, \u201cit wasn\u2019t common.\u201d But the truth is, 10-25 percent of pregnancies end in miscarriage , and 12 percent (7.5 million) of women in the U.S. suffer from infertility. \nIt does happen. And it\u2019s not uncommon. \nThankfully, more and more women are talking about it now, so those who endure it feel less alone. And in sharing their stories openly, they\u2019re helping to dispel the feelings of shame and failure that women generations ago felt in secret. One such woman is Nancy Kerrigan, former figure skating Olympian, and current cast member of Dancing with the Stars . \nThis week\u2019s episode of DWTS highlighted personal struggles endured by each contestant, and the pain they\u2019ve overcome was reflected in the dances performed. Mr. T.\u2019s dance was in honor of his fight against cancer. Simone Biles dedicated her dance to her father, showcasing both her love for him and the trauma of her experience in foster care. And Nancy Kerrigan\u2019s performance was in honor of her children . Those she gave birth to, and those she sadly lost. \nIn rehearsal footage, Kerrigan was seen opening up to her dance partner, sharing that she had suffered for years with infertility, suffering six miscarriages over an eight-year period. \n\u201cI always thought I\u2019d have three kids by the time I was 30,\u201d Kerrigan later shared with People , adding that she imagined following right in her mom\u2019s footsteps. And although Kerrigan did go on to have three healthy children \u2014 Matthew, 20, Brian, 12, and Nicole, 9 \u2014 the years in between their births were filled with heartache over the six babies she was unable to carry to term. The first time that you go in and they tell you, \u2018Oh there\u2019s no heartbeat,\u2019 it\u2019s devastating \u2026 Share Quote Facebook Pinterest \nAfter one particularly painful miscarriage, she recalls how difficult it was to tell her son. \u201cHow do you explain [a miscarriage] to a little kid?\u201d asked Kerrigan, in this week\u2019s episode. \u201cHaving to tell them that it was now gone and they had to take it out? He asked why and we had to explain, \u2018Because it\u2019s dead. It\u2019s not alive anymore.\u2019 That was awful.\u201d She also says it felt shameful because she \u201ccouldn\u2019t do it on [her] own.\u201d \n\u201cThe first time that you go in and they tell you, \u2018Oh there\u2019s no heartbeat,\u2019 it\u2019s devastating,\u201d Kerrigan told People , adding that doctors were never able to give her a reason why she kept miscarrying in the years after Matthew\u2019s birth. \u201cI felt like a failure,\u201d she shared. \nThankfully, in vitro fertilization treatments did eventually work for Nancy and her husband, Jerry Solomon, and they welcomed both Brian and Nicole to complete their family of five. It was for them that she danced the foxtrot to \u201cMy Wish\u201d by Rascal Flatts this week \u2014 an emotional and vulnerable performance that earned her quite a bit of praise from the judges. \nOne particularly poignant comment during the episode came from judge Julianne Hough, who said that she saw Kerrigan\u2019s childlike beauty and innocence shine through as she danced. \u201cI felt like I was watching your 10-year old self,\u201d said Hough. \nIt\u2019s hard not to hear those words now and not think of that little 10-year-old Kerrigan once was \u2014 the little girl who so long ago dreamed of having three kids by age 30. But if Kerrigan could speak to her now, I\u2019m sure she\u2019d tell her that although her plan may not work out exactly as she\u2019d hoped, in the end, she\u2019d be okay. \nHopefully, infertility and miscarriage will continue to remain a part of the conversation for women, not just for those in the celebrity world, but for everyday moms around the world. Rather than feeling ashamed of our struggles with infertility \u2014 or worse, like failures \u2014 knowing that we aren\u2019t alone will allow us to love ourselves, and ultimately do the healing that we need.

In studies of mice, scientists discovered a drug, designed to silence a gene called ataxin 2, may be effective at treating ALS and SCA2. NIH/NINDS \nIn two studies of mice, researchers showed that a drug, engineered to combat the gene that causes spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), might also be used to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Both studies were published in the journal Nature with funding from National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), part of the National Institutes of Health. \n\u201cOur results provide hope that we may one day be able to treat these devastating disorders,\u201d said Stefan M. Pulst, M.D., Dr. Med., University of Utah, professor and chair of neurology and a senior author of one the studies. In 1996, Dr. Pulst and other researchers discovered that mutations in the ataxin 2 gene cause spinocerebellar ataxia type 2, a fatal inherited disorder that primarily damages a part of the brain called the cerebellum, causing patients to have problems with balance, coordination, walking and eye movements. \nFor this study his team found that they could reduce problems associated with SCA2 by injecting mouse brains with a drug programmed to silence the ataxin 2 gene. In the accompanying study, researchers showed that injections of the same type of drug into the brains of mice prevented early death and neurological problems associated with ALS, a paralyzing and often fatal disorder. \n\u201cSurprisingly, the ataxin 2 gene may act as a master key to unlocking treatments for ALS and other neurological disorders,\u201d said Aaron Gitler, Ph.D., Stanford University, associate professor and senior author of the second study. In 2010, Dr. Gitler and colleagues discovered a link between ataxin 2 mutations and ALS. \nThe type of drug they used is called an antisense oligonucleotide. Like an incomplete row of teeth on a zipper, these drugs are short sequences of DNA designed to bind to a portion of a gene\u2019s instructions carried by a molecule called messenger RNA. This stops cells from manufacturing proteins, a process known as gene silencing. \n\u201cOur antisense oligonucleotides prevent cells from reading the blueprint for the ataxin 2 gene,\u201d said Daniel R. Scoles, M.D., University of Utah and the lead author of the SCA2 study. \nAn antisense oligonucleotide drug has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating spinal muscular atrophy, a hereditary disorder that causes arm and leg muscle weakness and deterioration in children. Researchers are conducting early phase clinical trials on the safety and effectiveness of gene silencing drugs to treat several neurological disorders, including Huntington\u2019s disease and an inherited form of ALS. \n\u201cAntisense oligonucleotides provide researchers with a promising tool for studying the underlying causes of many disorders and developing gene-targeting treatments,\u201d said Amelie Gubitz, Ph.D., program director at NINDS. \nMutations in ataxin 2 that are associated with SCA2 cause the gene to have polyglutamine expansions, strings of repeated copies of the three letter genetic code, CAG, which stands for the amino acid glutamine. On average, symptoms appear earlier and are more severe for patients who have longer strings. People who have only 27-33 repeats will not develop SCA2 but have an increased risk for ALS. \nDr. Pulst\u2019s team worked with a pharmaceutical company to develop antisense oligonucleotides that silence the ataxin 2 gene rather than the CAG repeats. They then tested oligonucleotides on two lines of mice genetically engineered to have problems associated with SCA2 by programming neurons in the cerebellum to make mutant ataxin 2. \nIn both lines, the oligonucleotides appeared to be effective. Mice injected with the drug were able to walk on a rotating rod longer than mice that received a placebo. Electrical recordings showed the drug restored the firing patterns of neurons in the cerebellum to normal. In addition to reducing ataxin 2 gene levels, the researchers found that the drug also restored the levels of several genes that appear to be decreased by mutant ataxin 2. \nMeanwhile, Dr. Gitler\u2019s team used different mice to test the idea of combating ALS by silencing ataxin 2. These mice were genetically modified to manufacture high levels of the human version of TDP-43, a protein that normally regulates genes. The researchers investigated these mice because neurons from ALS patients often contain toxic clusters of TDP-43. The mice rapidly develop problems with walking and die early. Previous studies on yeast and flies by Dr. Gitler\u2019s team and his collaborators have suggested that mutant ataxin 2 may control the toxicity of TDP-43. \nCompared to placebo, injections of the antisense oligonucleotides into the nervous system of the newborn mice extended their median lifespan by 35 percent and improved their ability to walk, while lowering ataxin 2 gene levels in the brain and spinal cord. \nThe researchers saw similar results when they eliminated ataxin 2 by crossbreeding the TDP-43 mice with mice that are genetically programmed to have no ataxin 2 gene. The offspring lived longer and walked better than the TDP-43 mice. The brains of the offspring also had fewer toxic TDP-43 clusters than the TDP-43 mice. \n\u201cMany years of research on yeast and flies laid the ground work for these exciting results,\u201d said Daniel Miller, Ph.D., program director NINDS. \u201cThey demonstrate that rigorous studies on simple disease models can lead to powerful insights that help us understand and potentially treat seemingly untreatable disorders.\u201d \nDrs. Pulst and Gitler agreed that more research needs to be done before the types of antisense oligonucleotides their teams used can be tested in patients. Both labs are currently taking the next steps by conducting further preclinical experiments. \nThis study was supported by grants from the NINDS (NS033123, NS073009, NS081182, NS090930, NS065317, NS093865, NS073660, NS069375), Target ALS Foundation, the Robert Packard Center for ALS Research at Johns Hopkins, the Glenn Foundation, and the DFG. Ionis Pharmaceuticals supplied the authors with all of the antisense oligonucleotides in the described work. \nAbout NINDS is the nation\u2019s leading funder of research on the brain and nervous system. The mission of NINDS is to seek fundamental knowledge about the brain and nervous system and to use that knowledge to reduce the burden of neurological disease. \n  Articles \nScoles et al.

Cruising is a $37.85 billion industry in the United States, with the annual number of passengers averaging more than 20 million. \nWith all of these people in one relatively small space for days at a time, the chances for spreading germs are high. The challenge, then, is to avoid contact with germs and enjoy the cruise while staying healthy. Erica and Rob Bottai and their two children on a family trip to Belize. \nErica Bottai, a physician assistant with Kaiser Permanente Washington, has been on five cruises with her family of two children, a boy, 11, and a girl, 9. They took their first cruise in when the kids were 7 and 5 to the Mexican Riviera. \u201cNone of us have ever gotten sick and always had an amazing time,\u201d Bottai said. \u201cOur next cruise is in August.\u201d \nShe shared her tips and advice for enjoying the cruise and avoiding becoming ill. \nBefore you board, get these items \nDefinitely get plenty of alcohol-based hand sanitizer, disinfecting wipes, liquid soap and disinfecting spray. Remember to pack all medications. Consider Dramamine to avoid getting sea sick and having to visit the sick bay. \nPack items in plastic bags and consider storing pajamas and stuffed animals in bags under the pillows once on board. \nWhen you reach your cabin \nOverall, keep in mind that everything you will touch will have been touched by many other people. That\u2019s why hand sanitizer, disinfecting wipes and Lysol are essential: Use them liberally and often. Bathroom countertops, desks and other countertops often teem with microbes \u2014 as do phones and remote controls. \n\u201cWhen you first get into your cabin, wipe down every surface and item in the room,\u201d Bottai said. \u201cEverything from a bathroom counter and phone to the light switches and ice buckets. You never know who was in the room before you and how healthy that person may have been.\u201d \nClean the surfaces around you with disinfecting wipes and avoid touching the remote control all together by putting it in a clear plastic bag before using. Repeat the cleaning process daily after housekeeping, Bottai said. \n\u201cI also take antibacterial dish soap and clean everything that touches the floor,\u201d she said. \u201cI take an extra toothbrush and always end up needing it.\u201d \nWhile on the cruise \nWash your hands often! The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing your hands before putting them to your mouth. This includes before eating and drinking and brushing your teeth. Always wash your hands after going to the bathroom, blowing your nose, changing diapers, or helping a sick person. \nAfter you\u2019ve been out and about on the cruise ship touching \u201chigh-hand contact surfaces,\u201d including railings, door knobs and elevator buttons, immediately wash your hands when you get back to your cabin. Avoid touching handrails and doorknobs when possible. If warm water and soap are not immediately available, use the hand sanitizer you\u2019ve brought with you or what the ship provides. \nYou may want to avoid drinks with ice in them. Some cruise line kitchens make their own ice cubes \u2014 the problem is that the water tanks can host germs. However, do drink lots of water. Staying hydrated is important. Bottai and her family bring their own drinking cups and reusable \u201cimitation ice\u201d to keep drinks cold. \nBe wary of buffet lines. Wipe down silverware before using, and always get a fresh plate. \nAvoid direct contact with anything in the public restrooms. Use napkins or wipes to open and lock the doors. Clean surfaces with wipes before touching them. The Bottai family uses the restroom in their cabin only. \nWear flip-flops to avoid going barefoot. \nWeeks before your trip \nWe\u2019ve covered some ways to avoid microbes while cruising along on your travels (so to speak). But a great way to avoid getting sick is to make sure you\u2019re up-to-date on immunizations and vaccinations at least a couple weeks before boarding a ship. \n\u201cGetting vaccines and immunizations lowers your risk of getting sick while traveling,\u201d said Bottai. \nHappy, healthy travels!", "crawled": "2017-04-12T20:22:21.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-12T20:22:21.000+03:00", "uuid": "fb0fcdcf20bfaf815f2a525d44471f02cf0cdadd", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 518, "likes": 518}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 114}}, "country": "US", "site": "kaiserpermanente.org", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "https://share.kaiserpermanente.org/category/rss-feed/feed", "uuid": "fb0fcdcf20bfaf815f2a525d44471f02cf0cdadd", "section_title": "rss-feed \u2013 Kaiser Permanente Share", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 5, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTAbGCr87g7zLXcVoeBxdi4TzVOUVbxyds6iRXvTwZOUgTd7D80DBx0YYvR4PZOxmPFNx1.yuptG6TGMTftf2EH", "domain_rank": 1935, "main_image": "https://share.kaiserpermanente.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/kids-cruise-ship-feature-548x336.jpg", "site_full": "share.kaiserpermanente.org", "title_full": "A Guide to Germ-Free Cruising", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "A Guide to Germ-Free Cruising", "published": "2017-04-12T20:22:21.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTAbGCr87g7zLXcVoeBxdi4TzVOUVbxyds6iRXvTwZOUgTd7D80DBx0YYvR4PZOxmPFNx1.yuptG6TGMTftf2EH", "author": "Karen Hershenson", "external_links": [], "title": "A Guide to Germ-Free Cruising", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Follow all of ScienceDaily's latest research news and top science headlines !

Credit: Alexandra Angelich (NRAO/AUI/NSF) Close Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), astronomers have revealed extraordinary details about a recently discovered far-flung member of our solar system, the planetary body 2014 UZ224, more informally known as DeeDee. \nAt about three times the current distance of Pluto from the Sun, DeeDee is the second most distant known trans-Neptunian object (TNO) with a confirmed orbit, surpassed only by the dwarf planet Eris. Astronomers estimate that there are tens-of-thousands of these icy bodies in the outer solar system beyond the orbit of Neptune. \nThe new ALMA data reveal, for the first time, that DeeDee is roughly 635 kilometers across, or about two-thirds the diameter of the dwarf planet Ceres, the largest member of our asteroid belt. At this size, DeeDee should have enough mass to be spherical, the criteria necessary for astronomers to consider it a dwarf planet, though it has yet to receive that official designation. \n\"Far beyond Pluto is a region surprisingly rich with planetary bodies. Some are quite small but others have sizes to rival Pluto, and could possibly be much larger,\" said David Gerdes, a scientist with the University of Michigan and lead author on a paper appearing in the Astrophysical Journal Letters . \"Because these objects are so distant and dim, it's incredibly difficult to even detect them, let alone study them in any detail. ALMA, however, has unique capabilities that enabled us to learn exciting details about these distant worlds.\" \nCurrently, DeeDee is about 92 astronomical units (AU) from the Sun. An astronomical unit is the average distance from Earth to the Sun, or about 150 million kilometers. At this tremendous distance, it takes DeeDee more than 1,100 years to complete one orbit. Light from DeeDee takes nearly 13 hours to reach Earth. \nGerdes and his team announced the discovery of DeeDee in the fall of 2016. They found it using the 4-meter Blanco telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile as part of ongoing observations for the Dark Energy Survey, an optical survey of about 12 percent of the sky that seeks to understand the as-yet mysterious force that is accelerating the expansion of the universe. \nThe Dark Energy Survey produces vast troves of astronomical images, which give astronomers the opportunity to also search for distant solar system objects. The initial search, which includes nearly 15,000 images, identified more than 1.1 billion candidate objects. The vast majority of these turned out to be background stars and even more distant galaxies. A small fraction, however, were observed to move slowly across the sky over successive observations, the telltale sign of a TNO. \nOne such object was identified on 12 separate images. The astronomers informally dubbed it DeeDee, which is short for Distant Dwarf. \nThe optical data from the Blanco telescope enabled the astronomers to measure DeeDee's distance and orbital properties, but they were unable to determine its size or other physical characteristics. It was possible that DeeDee was a relatively small member of our solar system, yet reflective enough to be detected from Earth. Or, it could be uncommonly large and dark, reflecting only a tiny portion of the feeble sunlight that reaches it; both scenarios would produce identical optical data. \nSince ALMA observes the cold, dark universe, it is able to detect the heat -- in the form of millimeter-wavelength light -- emitted naturally by cold objects in space. The heat signature from a distant solar system object would be directly proportional to its size. \n\"We calculated that this object would be incredibly cold, only about 30 degrees Kelvin, just a little above absolute zero,\" said Gerdes. \nWhile the reflected visible light from DeeDee is only about as bright as a candle seen halfway the distance to the moon, ALMA was able to quickly home in on the planetary body's heat signature and measure its brightness in millimeter-wavelength light. \nThis allowed astronomers to determine that it reflects only about 13 percent of the sunlight that hits it. That is about the same reflectivity of the dry dirt found on a baseball infield. \nBy comparing these ALMA observations to the earlier optical data, the astronomers had the information necessary to calculate the object's size. \"ALMA picked it up fairly easily,\" said Gerdes. \"We were then able to resolve the ambiguity we had with the optical data alone.\" \nObjects like DeeDee are cosmic leftovers from the formation of the solar system. Their orbits and physical properties reveal important details about the formation of planets, including Earth. \nThis discovery is also exciting because it shows that it is possible to detect very distant, slowly moving objects in our own solar system. The researchers note that these same techniques could be used to detect the hypothesized \"Planet Nine\" that may reside far beyond DeeDee and Eris. \n\"There are still new worlds to discover in our own cosmic backyard,\" concludes Gerdes. \"The solar system is a rich and complicated place.\" \n  National Radio Astronomy Observatory .   \nJournal Reference : D.

Share: FULL STORY B vitamins can mitigate the impact of fine particle pollution on cardiovascular disease, according to new research conducted at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. Healthy non-smokers who took vitamin B supplements nearly reversed any negative effects on their cardiovascular and immune systems, weakening the effects of air pollution on heart rate by 150 percent, total white blood count by 139 percent, and lymphocyte count by 106 percent. \nThis is the first clinical trial to evaluate whether B vitamin supplements change the biologic and physiologic responses to ambient air pollution exposure. The study initiates a course of research for developing preventive pharmacological interventions using B vitamins to contain the health effects of air pollution. The findings are published online in the Nature Publishing Group journal, Scientific Reports . \nAmbient fine particulate pollution contributes to 3.7 million premature deaths annually worldwide, predominantly through acute effects on the cardiovascular system. Particulate matter pollution is the most frequent trigger for myocardial infarction at the population level. \n\"Ambient PM2.5 pollution is one of the most common air pollutants and has a negative effect on cardiac function and the immune system,\" said Jia Zhong, PhD, principal investigator, and postdoctoral research officer in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences at Columbia's Mailman School. \"For the first time, our trial provides evidence that B-vitamin supplementation might attenuate the acute effects of PM2.5 on cardiac dysfunction and inflammatory markers.\" \nThe paper builds on research published in March that found B vitamins reduce the negative effects of air pollution as measured by epigenetic markers. \nIn the new study, researchers recruited ten healthy, 18 to 60-year-old, non-smoking volunteers who were not on any form of B vitamin supplements or other medication. All volunteers received a placebo for four weeks preceding a two-hour exposure experiment to concentrated ambient PM2.5 (250 ? g/m3), after which they were administered B vitamin supplements for four weeks before the next two-hour exposure experiment to PM2.5. A particle-free two-hour exposure was included to provide baseline data. The controlled exposure experiments were conducted from July 2013 to February 2014 at the same time of day and adjusted for season, temperature, and humidity. \n\"Our results showed that a two-hour exposure to concentrated ambient PM2.5 had substantial physiologic impacts on heart rate, heart rate variability, and white blood counts. Further, we demonstrated that these effects are nearly reversed with four-week B-vitamin supplementation,\" noted Andrea Baccarelli, MD, PhD, chair and Leon Hess Professor of Environmental Health Sciences at the Mailman School. \nBecause the researchers studied healthy adults from lightly polluted urban environment, they caution that their findings might not be generalizable to populations that are at higher risk for pollution-induced cardiovascular effects, including children, older adults, individuals with pre-existing cardiovascular disease, and individuals residing in heavily polluted areas. \n\"With ambient PM2.5 levels far exceeding air quality standards in many large urban areas worldwide, pollution regulation remains the backbone of public health protection against its cardiovascular health effects. Studies like ours cannot diminish -- nor be used to underemphasize -- the urgent need to lower air pollution levels to -- at a minimum -- meet the air quality standards set forth in the United States and other countries. However, residual risk remains for those who are sensitive, and high exposures are, unfortunately, the rule still in many megacities throughout the world,\" said Dr. Baccarelli. \nStory Source: \nMaterials provided by Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health .

Mom Creates Dance Program for Kids with Special Needs, So Everyone Has a Chance to Shine Image Source: Sarah Nelson Conklin \nKim Smith\u2019s daughter Reagan was diagnosed with both autism and sensory processing disorder at just 18 months old; but that hasn\u2019t stopped the bubbly little girl from following her dreams. And so far, those dreams have included dancing her little heart out. \nNow 7 years old, Reagan happily attends a weekly dance class. But sadly, only a few short years ago, Smith couldn\u2019t find any class that would admit her daughter, due to her disabilities. \nShe tells Babble: \n\u201cBetween the ages of 5 and 6 I really struggled trying to find a class outside of therapies she attends where she could develop social skills with peers. The last place where she attended a special needs cheer program she would pretty much be left on the sidelines because \u2018she required too much\u2019 and they didn\u2019t have enough volunteers although all the other children were matched with a volunteer.\u201d Image Source: Kim Smith \nSmith, who has two older daughters as well, was understandably distraught over not being able to provide her youngest with a creative outlet. \n\u201cAs a parent it was heartbreaking to feel like she didn\u2019t fit in at a place that was exactly where she should have fit in,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI knew there had to be other parents that felt the same way.\u201d Image Source: Sarah Nelson Conklin \nAs it turned out, there was. \nSoon after, Smith fired off a simple Facebook status, lamenting: \u201cI wish I had studio space where I could offer a dance class to children with special needs.\u201d \nMoments later, Smith\u2019s dreams (and her daughter\u2019s) would come true, when Donna Mitzel of Miss Donna\u2019s School of Dance, saw the post and offered some space in her dance school. Just weeks later, A Chance to Dance was born \u2014 giving Reagan, and dozens of other kids just like her, a place to embrace their creative side. Image Source: Kim Smith \nSmith first kicked off the program in 2015, with just one class. But she has since expanded the program from one studio to multiple, and added variety of new classes into the mix. In total, the program now has 35 students and 14 volunteers who assist the young dancers, who are grateful to have a non-judgmental environment where they can interact, be themselves, and make friends. \n\u201cEven for our nonverbal kiddos it is amazing to watch them blossom,\u201d Smith says, adding that students in each class learn a routine that\u2019s performed at an end-of-year recital. Image Source: Karen Garfein \nAnd A Chance to Dance isn\u2019t just for young kids \u2014 the students range in age from 3 to 26, and have a variety of special needs, such as autism, Down syndrome, ADHD, cerebral palsy, tuberous sclerosis, prosthetic limbs, schizencephaly, sensory processing disorder (SPD), and spina bifida. \n\u201cIt\u2019s our goal to always have fun and to maintain a positive, reassuring, encouraging and loving environment,\u201d Smith notes. \nThe experience has left a big impact not just on Smith, but on her daughter Reagan, as well. \n\u201cReagan has friends now that invite her to birthday parties and last year we had our first ever Christmas celebration and she along with her friends had such a wonderful time,\u201d says Smith. \u201cThis program is about so much more than dance \u2026 we are a family.\u201d Image Source: Kim Smith \nAngie Sinyard, whose daughter has tuberous sclerosis, epilepsy autism, ADHD, and SPD, couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the program \u2014 or the amazing mother behind it. \n\u201cAs a mother to a spunky 6-year-old girl who loves to dance, I can\u2019t imagine life without this program and how empty my child\u2019s life would be,\u201d she told Babble in an email. \nSinyard continues: \n\u201cMy child was told she may never dance. She has already had two brain surgeries at Duke and I\u2019m typing you this email while I sit here at Duke Children\u2019s Hospital waiting room while she is having her scans done of her brain and kidneys to check for new tumors and growth of existing tumors \u2026 However, when my child wakes up and we go home she will start getting excited for dance class Sunday. Where she can go be herself and dance her little heart out.\u201d \nIt\u2019s pretty clear that A Chance to Dance is more than just a dance class, giving it students a sense of purpose and an outlet for them to let loose and just be kids. And most heartwarming of all, it allows parents to see their children glow from the inside out \u2014 forgetting, if only for an hour, that they have any limitations. Image Source: Kim Smith \nSmith says she has so many special memories since the program began. But one of her favorites, from June 2016, always seems to come to mind first. That\u2019s when seven of her students took the stage at Belk Theater at the Blumenthal Performing Arts Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. (\u201cThe same stage where the Broadway musicals perform when they tour here,\u201d she explains.) The girls performed to the song \u201cReflection\u201d from Disney\u2019s Mulan in front of an audience of 2,000 \u2014 where Smith says \u201cthey received a standing ovation.\u201d Related Post After Her Toddler Nearly Drowns, Mom Issues Urgent Plea to Other Parents Image Source: Kim Smith \n\u201cI sat at the very front of the stage watching them, and when I heard the amount of cheering and clapping when they were done dancing, I of course stood up and clapped for them,\u201d Smith says. \u201cI heard someone say \u2018Kim turn around.\u2019 When I turned around and saw everyone on their feet I burst into tears. In that moment I knew just how special this was. Those seven princesses received a standing ovation.\u201d Image Source: Sarah Nelson Conklin \n(Excuse me for a second, I think I need a moment to wipe away a few of my own tears. Is this not the most touching thing you\u2019ve ever heard?) \nIt\u2019s amazing to think that what once began as a simple Facebook status \u2014 and one mom\u2019s silent prayer for her daughter \u2014 has grown into a thriving dance company that\u2019s added something truly special into the lives of so many kids. Kim Smith and her daughter Reagan have clearly proven that with an open heart (and an open mind) dreams really do come true.

That's about all we can say about this innovative new crib from Ford that mimics the sound and feel of riding in a car. By Melissa Willets Comments \nEvery new parent quickly learns that sometimes babies sleep better in the car than in their cribs. Or their bassinets. Or their pack 'n plays... Yup, getting in a car-ride snooze can sometimes be the only guaranteed sleep time when it comes to infants, next to holding them in your arms. \nSo now, to capitalize on this phenomenon, car-maker Ford has created the Max Motor Dreams crib , a sleep space which basically mimics the motion of a car ride . Watch the miracle maker in action in this YouTube video, posted to Ford's Spanish channel. \nNot only does the crib feel like a car for baby, but lights simulate passing vehicles' headlights and streetlights. Incredibly, parents can also use an app to simulate the exact conditions in their car, including the hum of the motor. \nIn a press release , Max Motor Dreams designer Alejandro L\u00f3pez Bravo, of Spanish creative studio Espada y Santa Cruz, said, \"After many years of talking to mums and dads, we know that parents of newborns are often desperate for just one good night's sleep. But while a quick drive in the family car can work wonders in getting baby off to sleep, the poor old parents still have to be awake and alert at the wheel. The Max Motor Dreams could make the everyday lives of a lot of people a little bit better.\" New parent?

In my experience, they certainly don\u2019t tell you about the really intense stuff. \nI remember coming back to the doctor after that very first prescription and having this interaction: \nMe: I\u2019ve been having a lot of headaches and stomach issues since I started taking that medicine. \nDoctor: Yes, that\u2019s unfortunately very common. \nI didn\u2019t say it out loud, but I definitely remember thinking, \u201cThat would have been good to know before I started taking this!\u201d \nDrowsiness and fatigue can also be common, which is wonderful because we depressives already struggle with fatigue and lack of motivation. \nWeight gain is reported from many antidepressants.

It\u2019s as high as 50% (or more!) , according to some studies. For guys, that can mean erectile dysfunction. For men and women, this likely means difficulty or inability to achieve orgasm. As if being depressed wasn\u2019t already bad enough. \nAnd last, but not least, there\u2019s other weird stuff: dry mouth, lightheadedness, dizziness, agitation, and my all-time favorite\u2026\u201cbrain zaps.\u201d Yes, I\u2019m talking about this really freaky sensation that I\u2019ve only had when taking an SNRI.

Here's How Much it Would Cost You to Vacation Like a Kardashian Photo: Getty Images \nIf you've been considering adopting a dog or a cat, this new study might help you make up your mind: According to research published in Microbiome, children born into homes with pets have higher levels of gut microbes that protect against allergies and obesity . Researchers say that indirect exposure to furry friends is especially beneficial to babies in their first three months of life, and even while they\u2019re still in the womb. \nThis period appears to be a \u201ccritical window of time when gut immunity and microbes co-develop,\u201d says lead author Anita Kozyrskyj, PhD, a pediatric epidemiologist at the University of Alberta. Disruptions to this development process\u2014for example, the introduction of foreign bacteria\u2014can change immunity and have implications for long-term health, she adds. \nKozyrskyj\u2019s study compared fecal samples from 746 Canadian infants. Some of the infants were from families with pets (70% of which were dogs), some were from families who had pets during their pregnancy but not once the babies were born, and some had no recent pets. \nThe researchers found that babies from households with pets had twice the amount of two specific bacteria, Ruminococcus and Oscillospira , that have been linked with reduced risk for childhood allergies (such as dermatitis and asthma ) and obesity , respectively. \nEven when pets had been given up for adoption before the babies were born, this benefit was still seen. This shows that pet exposure affected the babies\u2019 microbiomes indirectly, with influential bacteria transferring from the animal to the mother to the unborn child. \nThis bacterial exchange occurred regardless of the type of birth (vaginal versus C-section ), regardless of whether the babies were breastfed, and regardless of whether antibiotics were used during birth. This is important, say the authors, as previous research has shown that C-sections, antibiotics, and not breastfeeding can all negatively impact babies\u2019 immunity. \nThe presence of pets in the house during a woman's pregnancy was also associated with a reduced likelihood that she would transmit group B strep bacteria\u2014which can colonize in the vagina and cause pneumonia in newborns\u2014to her baby during birth. \nTo get our best wellness advice delivered to you inbox, sign up for the Healthy Living newsletter \nThe study builds on decades of research showing that exposure to dirt and bacteria can help children build up immunity, and that kids who grow up with pets have lower rates of asthma and allergies, says Kozyrskyj. (This effect is strongest with dogs but is true with cats, as well.) \u201cPets have always been our best friends and they appear to be good for our babies too,\u201d she says. \nBut further studies are needed to provide definitive evidence that a \u201cdog intervention\u201d during pregnancy can actually prevent allergies. \u201cOur next step is to pursue the \u2018does it matter\u2019 question, to determine the allergy and obesity outcomes of studied infants at ages 1, 3, and 5,\u201d Kozyrskyj says. \nAnd of course, allergies and obesity aren\u2019t products of the environment alone; genetics also play a role. It also makes sense that kids with pets have natural protection against allergies, since parents with allergies are less likely to have dogs and cats in the first place. \nRELATED: 13 Fun Ways to Work Out With Your Dog \nBut the study\u2019s results were adjusted to account for whether the mothers had asthma or allergies, and still held true. Kozyrskyj says her team\u2019s findings \"are independent of these two possible explanations.\" \nIt\u2019s not far-fetched to think that pet exposure during pregnancy could one day be an official recommendation from doctors, Kozyrskyj says. It\u2019s even possible that scientists could develop a \u201cdog in a pill\u201d supplement, she adds, for mothers to take as a preventative measure against allergies and asthma. \nMore research is needed for these scenarios to actually happen, however. For now, families have have another reason (on top of plenty already!) to snuggle up to their fur babies\u2014and that includes moms-to-be.

But like most mental health conditions, sociopathy\u2014or antisocial personality disorder (ASP)\u2014exists on a spectrum; and not all sociopath are serial killers. One study estimated that as many as 3.8% of Americans would meet the condition\u2019s diagnostic criteria. So odds are, you know someone who has ASP. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a syndrome characterized by lifelong misbehavior,\u201d says Donald W. Black, MD, professor of psychiatry at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine. \u201cPeople with an antisocial personality disorder tend to be deceitful , impulsive. They ignore responsibilities and, in the worst cases, they have no conscience.\u201d \nThe disorder can be relatively mild, he adds: \u201cMaybe they lie, maybe they get into trouble with their spouses, and that\u2019s about it.\u201d At the other end of the spectrum are thieves and murderers, says Dr. Black, who is the author of Bad Boys, Bad Men: Confronting Antisocial Personality Disorder (Sociopathy) . \u201cMost people are in the middle.\u201d \nRELATED: 10 Subtle Signs of Bipolar Disorder \nOne thing to note: While we tend to use the terms \u201csociopath\u201d and \u201cpsychopath\u201d interchangeably, they mean different things. Whereas most sociopaths are prone to impulsive behavior and often seen as disturbed or unhinged, a psychopath is cold and calculating, sometimes even charming. \u201cI view [psychopathy] as the extreme end of the antisocial spectrum,\u201d says Dr. Black, \u201cbecause virtually all psychopaths are antisocial, but not all antisocials have psychopathy.\u201d \nTo be diagnosed with ASP, a person must be at least 18 years old and have a history of aggression, rule-breaking, and deceit that dates back to their childhood. Here are some of the other red flags to watch out for, based on criteria listed in the DSM-V. Symptom: Lack of empathy \nPerhaps one of the most well-known signs of ASP is a lack of empathy , particularly an inability to feel remorse for one\u2019s actions. \u201cMany people with ASP do seem to lack a conscience, but not all of them,\u201d he explains. Psychopaths always have this symptom, however, which is what makes them especially dangerous. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t experience remorse, you\u2019re kind of freed up to do anything\u2014anything bad that comes to mind,\u201d says Dr. Black. Symptom: Difficult relationships \nPeople with ASP find it hard to form emotional bonds, so their relationships are often unstable and chaotic, says Dr. Black. Rather than forge connections with the people in their lives, they might try to exploit them for their own benefit through deceit, coercion, and intimidation. Symptom: Manipulativeness \nSociopaths tend to try to seduce and ingratiate themselves with the people around them for their own gain, or for entertainment. But this doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re all exceptionally charismatic: \u201cIt may be true of some, and it is often said of the psychopath that they\u2019re superficially charming,\u201d says Dr. Black. \u201cBut I see plenty of antisocial men in my hospital and in our out patient clinic and I would not use the term charming to describe them.\u201d \nRELATED: 11 Signs of Borderline Personality Disorder Symptom: Deceitfulness \nSociopaths have a reputation for being dishonest and deceitful. They often feel comfortable lying to get their own way, or to get themselves out of trouble. They also have a tendency to embellish the truth when it suits them. Symptom: Callousness \nSome might be openly violent and aggressive . Others will cut you down verbally. Either way, people with ASP tend to show a cruel disregard for other people\u2019s feelings. Symptom: Hostility \nSociopaths are not only hostile themselves, but they\u2019re more likely to interpret others\u2019 behavior as hostile, which drives them to seek revenge. \nTo get our best mental health stories delivered to you inbox, sign up for the Healthy Living newsletter Symptom: Irresponsibility \nAnother sign that someone might have ASP is a disregard for financial and social obligations. Ignoring responsibilities is extremely common, says Dr. Black. Think, for example, not paying child support when it\u2019s due, allowing bills to pile up, and regularly taking time off work. Symptom: Impulsivity \nWe all have our impulsive moments: a last minute road trip, a drastic new hairstyle, or a new pair of shoes you just have to have. But for someone with ASP, making spur of the moment decisions with no thought for the consequences is part of everyday life, says Dr. Black. They find it extremely difficult to make a plan and stick to it. Symptom: Risky behavior \nCombine irresponsibility, impulsivity, and a need for instant gratification, and it\u2019s not surprising that sociopaths get involved in risky behavior. They tend to have little concern for the safety of others or for themselves. This means that excessive alcohol consumption , drug abuse , compulsive gambling, unsafe sex , and dangerous hobbies (including criminal activities) are common. \nRELATED: 10 Signs You Might Be a Narcissist Can ASP be treated? \nTherapy can help manage some of the symptoms and side effects, particularly in milder cases. But it\u2019s unusual for a sociopath to seek professional help. \u201cOne of the curious things about this disorder is a general lack of insight,\u201d explains Dr. Black. \u201cThey may recognize that they have problems. They notice that they get into trouble. They may know that their spouses are not happy with them. They know that they get into trouble on the job.

Viral Post Highlights the Cold Reality of Foster Care That We Don\u2019t Often See Karen Johnson \nAt this very moment, there are over 400,000 children in the U.S. foster care system , with the highest percentage (50,000) being 16 and 17 years old. But at any age, the life of a foster child is often a heartbreaking one, moving from home to home, with all belongings carried in a trash bag. \nBy their teenage years, many of these kids are simply lost; and it\u2019s a painful reality one foster mom named Sarah knows all too well. The Georgia woman recently wrote a viral Facebook post about the pain of watching a child stand in court and hear the judge declare that \u201cno one wants him\u201d \u2014 a heartbreaking reality that so many foster children face. \nIn the post, which was shared on the Facebook page Foster Your Heart Out , Sarah says she was shaking in court as she watched a boy with tears roll down his face. \u201cDoes anyone want the child?\u201d the judge asked the court. \u201cAre you sure? Nobody? Ok, we will be back in a few weeks and finish paperwork.\u201d \nBy definition, foster care is\u201ca system by which a certified, stand-in \u2018parent(s)\u2019 cares for minor children or young people who have been removed from their birth parents or other custodial adults by state authority.\u201d Put in place as a means to protect kids who are facing harm or neglect, it often does just that. Ideally, it\u2019s a temporary solution, with the main goal being that the child is permanently returned to his parents or adopted by a new family. But the reality is, many kids who are placed into the foster care system never actually leave it. They spend their entire childhoods drifting from temporary home to temporary home, with no solid attachments or bonds created, and often without ever truly feeling loved. \nAnd Sarah knows first-hand how this lack of stability, love, and support often leads to behavioral issues: \n\u201cWe ask them to act like respectful members of society,\u201d she writes in her post. \u201cBut we drop them off at strangers homes with everything they own in trash bags. They have to hear nobody wants them or the few people that might are not fit. Then we drop them off at school to handle these emotions. And shake our heads when they are expelled again. We tell them to stay out of trouble and label them as bad kids for outbursts of anger and frustration.\u201d \nShe ends her post with one powerful statement: \u201cWhy are our juvenile jails full? Because our custody court rooms are empty.\u201d \nThere is quite a bit about the foster care system that Sarah clearly believes in, or she wouldn\u2019t be there, in court, sitting next to this child. A child who may enter another home next week, holding his garbage bag. A child who may get in trouble again at his new school. A child who knows that he might never have a forever family. Sarah tells Babble that up until last night, she was his foster parent; but now, just like so many foster kids, his future is uncertain. \nSarah also shares that most foster parents are doing their best with the resources they\u2019ve been given; but it isn\u2019t easy. The purpose of her post, she says, is to spread the message that these kids deserve someone fighting for them. \n\u201cThey don\u2019t need a perfect mom,\u201d Sarah says. \u201cThey just need a mama that will love them and never give up.\u201d Related Post Friends, Family, and Loved Ones: Please Stop Giving My Kids So Much Crap \nOne silver lining to this heartbreaking story is that this child does have one person in his life who cares. She\u2019s the one who sat next to him in court, as hot tears fell down his face. Hopefully, he felt her presence and love as he heard the judge\u2019s words. For that may be all he has to hold on to as he falls asleep tonight, and finds the strength to face tomorrow.

What I\u2019d Like to Tell My Husband, Who Comes Home to a Messy House at Night Image Source: Audra Rogers \nDear Husband, \nAs I sit in the recliner at the end of the day, I know what you\u2019re going to see when you get home: amped-up kids, a living room that looks like a disaster area, and the smell of a processed dinner thrown together 30 minutes ago. \nPlease allow me to explain what you may not notice beyond all the toys that cover the floor. \nWhat you probably don\u2019t see, underneath all the mess, is the mental weariness of a mom who knows things aren\u2019t done, but is having trouble finding motivation. \nWhat you don\u2019t see is how overwhelmed I feel knowing that cleaning up at any given point is actually counterproductive. \nWhat you see when you get home is exactly what\u2019s in this moment: the worst part of a long day. A day that exhausted the hearts and minds of stay-at-home moms everywhere with never-ending milk and snack requests. A day of refereeing arguments we didn\u2019t even witness because we dared to go to the bathroom for 30 seconds. A day of trying to be fair to everyone in split-second parenting decisions. A day of failing to remember whose turn it was last. \nWhat you see is an unflattering snapshot of what started out as a good day, with morning hugs and the promise of a clean slate for everyone. What you see is that day\u2019s optimism long gone by dinnertime. What you see is a day\u2019s optimism long gone by dinnertime \u2026 I waved the white flag for my sanity an hour ago. Share Quote Facebook Pinterest \nSometimes stay-at-home moms are deflated and defeated, and we just can\u2019t pick another battle. While we know the house is a wreck and understand why someone walking in the door might let out a big sigh or even rage-clean, we just can\u2019t do it. \nI know what you\u2019ll see when you get home, but I waved the white flag for my sanity an hour ago. \nMy fellow stay-at-home moms and I are trying to raise happy kids, keep a clean home, and get dinner on the table, but sometimes we have to pick two out of the three. If the kids are happy and the house is clean, then it\u2019s probably frozen pizza for dinner. If the kids are happy and a home-cooked meal is ready when you get home, please understand the kids destroyed the house while we made it. \nEventually, we get tired of balancing all of the spinning plates and have to let some of them fall in survival mode. Sometimes we just have to sit in the living room on the verge of tears and stare out the window and be still, or take a moment behind a closed bathroom door. It\u2019s hard on a mama\u2019s soul to work so hard providing a happy home and feel like a failure at the very same time. \nDepression and stress are very real dangers of stay-at-home parenthood. Everyone has endured a difficult season in their home life with young kids. Those who say they haven\u2019t either have some mythical unicorn schedule and perfectly cooperative kids, or they have older kids and have since forgotten what it\u2019s like. Eventually we get tired of balancing all of the spinning plates and have to let some of them fall in survival mode. Share Quote Facebook Pinterest \nYes, this is our home and we want to be here, but the effort is demanding as hell. There\u2019s no end-time to leave the office, no days off, and no pay. And just as a worker needs a break from their job during the week, I need a break from mine, too. \nSo please understand that I know what you see when you get home. If you see me roll my eyes and groan at the 16th request for milk while scrubbing dried yogurt off of the floor, I\u2019ve crossed the threshold from Mary Poppins to Mommy Dearest. Related Post The Case for Putting My Wife Before My Children \nI know you\u2019re tired at the end of the day, too, and don\u2019t want it all resting on your shoulders, either. But a little levity on the bad days wouldn\u2019t be all that bad. Regardless of what the house looks like or what we might be having for dinner, I promise happy kids will be at the top of the list every time. \nWhat we all need is to know we\u2019re doing a good job. I commend you for hitting the bricks every day to provide for us, though I may be jealous that you get to talk to adults most of the day. But then I recognize there are moments you aren\u2019t able to be here for, too. \nI know what you see, and I promise I\u2019m trying. \nThe busy, buried times with little ones will pass eventually. The kids are happy and stable, and that\u2019s the goal in having a parent at home, isn\u2019t it? I can almost guarantee the bad days are when I\u2019ll need to be reminded of this the most. \nSo like you, I see a sink full of dishes, baskets of laundry, and toys on the floor. But underneath it all, the kids are happy. \nAnd that\u2019s the most important thing you\u2019ll see when you get home.

Science News Team tackles mysterious disease afflicting wild and captive snakes Date: University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Summary: Biologists and veterinarians across the central and eastern United States are calling on researchers to help them identify, understand and potentially treat snake fungal disease, a baffling affliction affecting more than a dozen species of wild and captive snakes in at least 15 states.

Brian Stauffer Researchers are using a nebulizer to deliver an antifungal agent into the bodies of afflicted snakes, like this timber rattlesnake. Credit: L. Brian Stauffer Close Biologists and veterinarians across the central and eastern United States are calling on researchers at the University of Illinois to help them identify, understand and potentially treat snake fungal disease, a baffling affliction affecting more than a dozen species of wild and captive snakes in at least 15 states. \nThe Illinois team, led by veterinary clinical medicine professor Dr. Matt Allender and his colleagues at the Illinois Natural History Survey, are targeting every aspect of the disease -- its epidemiology, how it grows, how it is transmitted, how to treat it, and even which disinfectants work or don't work against the primary fungus associated with the disease, Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola . \n\"We have collaborative projects in nine states,\" Allender said. \"Some of our collaborators are just sending us samples and we're helping with the diagnostic testing. Others, including individuals at some zoos with infected snakes, are working with us to test new treatments.\" \nOne treatment now in testing involves nebulizing snakes individually in tanks, a drug-delivery method sometimes used on birds with respiratory problems. (Watch a video about this work.) \n\"Before this, nobody had nebulized a snake,\" Allender said. \"When I told my veterinary colleagues -- not biologists, but people who treat individual animals -- what I was planning, they said, 'That's never going to work.'\" \nAllender and former veterinary student Lauren Kane demonstrated, however, that administering treatments via a fine spray allows therapeutic levels of terbinafine, an antifungal agent that kills O. ophiodiicola in cell culture, to get into healthy snakes' blood plasma. Their report on this work appears in the Journal of Veterinary Pharmacology and Therapeutics. \nThe researchers are testing whether snakes with the disease actually benefit from the nebulizer treatment. \nMany other studies from Illinois will help those hoping to respond to snake fungal disease. One study led by Allender and first-year veterinary student Marta Rzadkowska and published in the Journal of Wildlife Diseases , reveals which disinfectant treatments -- used by veterinarians and wildlife biologists to prevent the spread of infection -- work against the fungus. \n\"Marta found lots of disinfectants that were effective,\" Allender said. \"But it's the ones that are not effective that are the bigger story, because those are the ones that the fungus is resistant to.\" \nOther recent advances on understanding snake fungal disease have come from Illinois, including a 2015 analysis led by INHS mycologist Andrew Miller and graduate student Daniel Raudabaugh. This was the first in-depth analysis of O. ophiodiiocola, focusing on what conditions are conducive to its survival. The team found many similarities between this fungus and the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome in bats. \nAllender and his colleagues also have provided a historical framework for snake fungal disease in Illinois. By examining museum specimens of rattlesnakes captured in Illinois over the course of 100 years, the researchers found that snake fungal disease first appeared in eastern massassauga rattlesnakes in Illinois in 2000, eight years before the researchers first confirmed it in wild massassaugas in southern Illinois. \nThey also demonstrated that O. ophiodiicola infection is a causative agent of snake fungal disease. Healthy captive snakes that became infected with the fungus experienced the same symptoms and decline seen in infected snakes captured in the wild, the researchers found. \nAllender and colleagues at several other institutions also are studying treatments other than nebulizing snakes. One particularly worrisome finding, to be published soon in the Journal of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine, is that treatments with voriconizole, an antifungal drug often used in animal care, sometimes kills even apparently healthy snakes. \n\"There is still so much we don't know about snake fungal disease,\" Allender said. \"We don't know anything about its effect on snake populations. It may be a conservation threat; it may not be. We don't know every snake species that is affected. We don't know whether the fungus is different in different parts of the country. And we don't know what is causing the emergence now.\" \n\"We're trying to protect an endangered species,\" said INHS herpetologist and postdoctoral researcher Sarah Baker, a collaborator with Allender on several studies. \"A lot of pit viper populations are declining -- not only in Illinois, but nationwide. \nSnake fungal disease is just one more threat that they have to contend with, and anything we can do -- to find effective treatments, for example, or disinfectants that stop people from spreading the disease from place to place -- could make a difference for their long-term survival.\" \nStory Source: \nMaterials provided by University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign .

Even though the Earth is approximately 70 percent water, the overwhelming majority of that water is saline and ocean-based, which means it\u2019s undrinkable for humans. Just 2.5 percent of the earth\u2019s water is freshwater, and even then \u2014 only 1 percent of that is readily accessible, as most of that is trapped in glaciers and snowfields. \nAs National Geographic explains, only about .007 percent of all the Earth\u2019s water is available to its massive human population. This, of course, is a tremendous problem. But a new salvation could be on the horizon. Scientists have developed a special graphene sieve that stands to change the game when it comes to the world\u2019s water crisis . \nGraphene is a super-thin sheet of carbon atoms that are organized in a hexagonal lattice, and was first identified at the University of Manchester in 2002. Since then, it has been heralded as a \u201cwonder material,\u201d and scientists have been doing their bests to develop affordable graphene-based barriers to desalinate water on a larger scale. \nAnd now, the team from Manchester has crafted a new device that can filter out salt using less energy. The new sieve is comprised of a graphene compound, known as graphene oxide, to create a rigid sieve that gets the job done. Dr. Rahul Nair led the University of Manchester researchers in their efforts to overcome some of the challenges posed by graphene as a water filtration system. \nGraphene oxide membranes have already been shown to be able to filter out small nanoparticles, organic molecules and even large salts. But smaller, common salts were still beyond their reach. Previous research found that graphene oxide membranes would swell up when exposed to water, in turn allowing the smaller salts to pass through along with water molecules. But Dr. Nair and his colleagues have found a way to circumvent this problem. By placing epoxy resin walls on either side of the graphene oxide sieve, they were able to control the expansion and keep the salt particles from passing through. (RELATED: Find more news about scientific discoveries at Discoveries.news .) \nRestricting the expansion in this way also gave the scientists the ability to fine-tune the properties of the membrane, such as adjusting how much salt was allowed to go through the sieve. As the BBC explains , when common salts dissolve in water, a \u201cshell\u201d of water molecules will form around the salt molecules. This actually allows the small \u201ccapillaries\u201d in the graphene oxide membrane to then be able to stop the salt from flowing through along with the water. \n\u201cWater molecules can go through individually, but sodium chloride cannot. It always needs the help of the water molecules. The size of the shell of water around the salt is larger than the channel size, so it cannot go through,\u201d Dr. Nair explained. And because water can flow through the graphene oxide membrane very quickly, it is ideal for water filtration. \nAccording to Dr. Nair, the size of the holes in the membrane is very important.

Even though the Earth is approximately 70 percent water, the overwhelming majority of that water is saline and ocean-based, which means it\u2019s undrinkable for humans. Just 2.5 percent of the earth\u2019s water is freshwater, and even then \u2014 only 1 percent of that is readily accessible, as most of that is trapped in glaciers and snowfields. \nAs National Geographic explains, only about .007 percent of all the Earth\u2019s water is available to its massive human population. This, of course, is a tremendous problem. But a new salvation could be on the horizon. Scientists have developed a special graphene sieve that stands to change the game when it comes to the world\u2019s water crisis . \nGraphene is a super-thin sheet of carbon atoms that are organized in a hexagonal lattice, and was first identified at the University of Manchester in 2002. Since then, it has been heralded as a \u201cwonder material,\u201d and scientists have been doing their bests to develop affordable graphene-based barriers to desalinate water on a larger scale. \nAnd now, the team from Manchester has crafted a new device that can filter out salt using less energy. The new sieve is comprised of a graphene compound, known as graphene oxide, to create a rigid sieve that gets the job done. Dr. Rahul Nair led the University of Manchester researchers in their efforts to overcome some of the challenges posed by graphene as a water filtration system. \nGraphene oxide membranes have already been shown to be able to filter out small nanoparticles, organic molecules and even large salts. But smaller, common salts were still beyond their reach. Previous research found that graphene oxide membranes would swell up when exposed to water, in turn allowing the smaller salts to pass through along with water molecules. But Dr. Nair and his colleagues have found a way to circumvent this problem. By placing epoxy resin walls on either side of the graphene oxide sieve, they were able to control the expansion and keep the salt particles from passing through. (RELATED: Find more news about scientific discoveries at Discoveries.news .) \nRestricting the expansion in this way also gave the scientists the ability to fine-tune the properties of the membrane, such as adjusting how much salt was allowed to go through the sieve. As the BBC explains , when common salts dissolve in water, a \u201cshell\u201d of water molecules will form around the salt molecules. This actually allows the small \u201ccapillaries\u201d in the graphene oxide membrane to then be able to stop the salt from flowing through along with the water. \n\u201cWater molecules can go through individually, but sodium chloride cannot. It always needs the help of the water molecules. The size of the shell of water around the salt is larger than the channel size, so it cannot go through,\u201d Dr. Nair explained. And because water can flow through the graphene oxide membrane very quickly, it is ideal for water filtration. \nAccording to Dr. Nair, the size of the holes in the membrane is very important. Keeping the capillary size at one nanometer, which is close to the size of a water molecule, forces the water to form an \u201cinterconnected arrangement like a train.\u201d Dr. Nair says this makes the water move faster, but that this can only occur when the channel size is very tiny. \nIn a statement, Dr. Nair described the discovery as \u201ca significant step forward and will open new possibilities for improving the efficiency of desalination technology.\u201d Given that the UN has predicted at least 14 percent of the world\u2019s population will suffer from water scarcity by 2025, this finding could really be described as more than \u201csignificant\u201d and could potentially save lives in the near future.

What we don't dream of is paying off said wedding until retirement. Seriously, though, the wedding industry \u2014 and its associated costs \u2014 have gotten out of hand, and an extravagant affair is totally expected nowadays. It puts undue pressure on couples and their families \u2014 but is spending a lot to get married really necessary? \nIn short, no. It's totally possible to have a memorable wedding without going broke. Here's some background on wedding costs and tips for how to cut yours. The average wedding budget in the U.S. \nAs the saying goes, it\u2019s never wise to compare yourself with others \u2014 but when it comes to how much you can expect to spend on a beautiful wedding, it helps to know what you\u2019re getting into. The latest numbers from The Knot pegged the average cost of a wedding in 2016 at $35,329. \nBut as you are picking your jaw up off the floor, remember this: An average is an average. There are probably a few fancy couples out there who have had extravagant weddings (that we could only hope to be invited to), bringing up the average for the rest of the engaged ladies trying to keep things modest. Yes, the U.S. average for a wedding looks a little pricey at face value, but CostofWedding.com estimates that most couples are going to spend less than $10,000, not including honeymoon expenses. \nMore: 25 Printable Wedding Checklists for the Type A Bride \nThat\u2019s more like it. Getting married is a beautiful and exciting milestone in many women\u2019s lives, but there\u2019s no shame in your game if you want to keep costs to a minimum. \nIf you need to trim the fat in your wedding budget, rethink these items that most wedding planners consider to be a total waste. 1. The flowers \nFlowers in a wedding may be nonnegotiable, but there are several workarounds to ensure that your fresh flowers don\u2019t break your wedding bank. \u201cWanting peonies, gardenias and garden roses might sound like a great idea until you realize that you can't afford them and instead your florist is suggesting alstromeria and daisies \u2014 it's the theory of champagne taste on a beer budget. Know your budget and do some price shopping before you determine exactly what you want in the way of flowers,\u201d says Kristen Tebbetts, floral partner on flower delivery site BloomNation and owner of Bloomers of La Jolla in La Jolla, California. \nAs a compromise, Kristen advises repurposing any and all flowers used in a wedding to help a bride save money. She says, \u201cCan you take the flowers off your arbor and turn them into a centerpiece for your head table? Can you put your bridesmaid bouquets in vases on a cocktail table after the ceremony (what are they really going to do with them, anyway)? Can your aisle flowers be reused as centerpieces? Moving flowers from the ceremony into the reception is a great way to maximize their use and get your money's worth. Just make sure that if you're paying your florist or coordinator to make the transition for you, it makes sense financially rather than paying for more flowers \u2014 sometimes, it's better to enlist an organized friend/guest to help out with a few details.\u201d \nMore: This Is Why Married Couples Sometimes Look Like Siblings 2. The extras \nOne of the biggest money-wasters Kimberly Morrill, owner of Your Perfect Bridesmaid , has seen in her six years helping couples plan their weddings is sweating the small stuff. \u201cCouples tend to waste a lot of money (and time and stress) on tiny details that no one else notices,\u201d Morrill says. \u201cCouples see these details on Pinterest (usually from unattainable styled shoots), and they spend a ton of money trying to recreate. Details like custom cocktail napkins, signs for everything, favors no one wants, additional pieces of stationary, etc. Guests notice the food, the bar, the energy, the love between the couple. They truly don't notice, and don't care about, the Pinterest-perfect touches.\u201d \nSpeaking of details, Anastasia Stevenson of How to DIY Wedding agrees that shelling out the big bucks on something as small as wedding favors is a bit much. \u201cMore often than not, we see at least two-thirds of the favors left at reception tables after the wedding. Guests are having a good time mingling and dancing and look at most favors as a useless encumbrance. The wise thing is to make sure they have a practical use or are something fun and theme-driven that everyone would want and are easily portable!\u201d Stevenson suggests useful and inexpensive favors like edible favors or personalized drink koozies instead. 3. The wedding gown \nWhile you may have your heart set on the picture-perfect gown, Katherine Oyer of Aisle Planner recommends making a detour before you head straight to the neighborhood bridal shop \u2014 and hitting up a sample sale instead. \u201cAt the end of each season, bridal salons and designers will typically sell their gowns \u2018off the rack\u2019 at a deeply discounted price. Brides will need to give each gown some extra time and attention while shopping to ensure there aren\u2019t any un \nfixable tears or major stains, but typically, most loose beading or threading issues can be taken care of during the alterations process. The money saved will be huge, and the best part \u2014 you can take your dress home that day!\u201d 4. The wedding program \nThis one\u2019s a quickie but a goodie that could save you a few hundred dollars on your total budget. Oyer says it\u2019s best to leave the program out completely if you are having a simple wedding since guests most likely won\u2019t need a printed guide for the ceremony. \u201cMost guests end up leaving their beautifully designed ceremony programs on their seats, leaving the couple with a pile of leftovers and wasted printing costs,\u201d Oyer explains. 5. The wedding venue \nIf you\u2019ve already tried pricing your wedding venue, then you\u2019ve probably had at least one mini heart attack leading up to your wedding day. Michele Velazquez, owner of Pop The Knot , a pop-up wedding company created as an alternative to sky-high wedding venue costs, says, \u201cThe biggest thing brides waste their money on is the venue. Venues can be extremely expensive, as high as $30,000 and up. To get a better deal on the venue, the bride should try to book it during off-season or on a weekday. If the bride is open to a pop-up wedding \u2014 which is where the couple come in and have a quick ceremony with little or no set-up \u2014 this opens all kinds of doors for a very inexpensive venue.\u201d \n\u201cA venue may allow her to have a pop-up wedding at 9 a.m. before their big wedding at noon, and the bride could get that $30,000 venue for $1,000,\u201d Velasquez explains. How to save even more \nIf your wedding budget still isn\u2019t budging after considering these helpful tips, there\u2019s a workaround for that, too. Velazquez recommends trying to combine services whenever possible to take advantage of wedding-friendly discounts. \u201cThere are many companies out there that offer discounts if you use their husband or wife for another service. For example, if you book an officiant and her husband is a photographer, they will offer you a discount if you book them both. There are a lot of businesses like that nowadays, which offer husband and wife teams and services like photo and video, officiant and photographer, etc.,\u201d she says. \nAnd if you can\u2019t find the two-fer combo Velasquez recommends, this may be the perfect time to brush up on your negotiating skills. As Stevenson tells it, most brides aren\u2019t aware of how wedding planning actually works, leading them to agree to pay full price for services they could have haggled on. Stevenson says, \u201cNegotiations with vendors can and should be done in circumstances where a package of services or items is presented. Let the vendor know that you do not need certain items and have them remove the cost from the package. Some venues will allow you to use your own vendors.\u201d If necessary, Stevenson adds, \u201cYou can lower your guest count, which will allow you more room in your budget for expensive flowers and d\u00e9cor.\u201d \nMore: 5 Myths About Married Sex That Need to Die Now \nSavvy planning can save you money, but it helps to remember that most weddings are expensive, says Morrill. \u201cMy biggest tip for clients is to have a clear budget and to stick with it. Yes, your wedding day is once in a lifetime (for 50 percent of the population, anyway) \u2014 but it is still only six hours of one day. Don't put yourself into years of debt just to have a great six hours.\u201d \nBefore you go, check out our slideshow below. Image: SheKnows \nOriginally published March 2016. Updated April 2017.

(We're assuming they're only studying the health of the baby, as the mental health of whichever parent steps in a little \"present\" from the dog first thing in the morning is probably not going to get high marks.) \nHow did researchers figure out that baby plus dog equals healthier baby? We'll do our best to explain. \nResearchers analyzed more than 700 moms and their babies over a three-year period. The researchers examined whether or not the mother-baby pairs also lived in homes with pets that were present during the first three months of the infant's life. (Seventy percent of the pets were dogs. Sorry, cat people. We're sure there's some super-cute research out there for you too. Someday.) \nMore: There's good science, and then there's dubious science, like this study about miserable mothers \nThe researchers then analyzed the babies' poop (really!). They found two very useful types of gut bacteria, oscillospira and ruminococcus (also linked with a fondness for Tilt-A-Whirls and a penchant for thinking too much in later life) in the stool of children who had exposure to household pets. \nSo what's the big deal? Well, oscillospira and ruminococcus have been negatively associated with childhood obesity and the probability of allergies \u2014 which means Maverick over there eating your thong underwear under the bed is actually a very good boy. \nHere's more science-magic: The data also suggests that if there is a dog present consistently during a woman's pregnancy \u2014 but the dog is gone when the child is born \u2014 the benefits are still there. Still, please don't use this as an excuse to get rid of Maverick and his taste for your La Perla lace lingerie. He really is a good boy and is happy to keep you and your baby well-stocked with oscillospira and ruminococcus for the rest of his life, which is more than you can say for most people, are we right? \n(Sometimes we just write things to make ourselves laugh. But the science is totally for real.)

Go brush your teeth! \nNothing. \nMe, getting pissed: Last warning! Teeth. Now. \nStill nothing. \nMe, ready to lose my shit : HEY! DUDE! TIME TO BRUSH YOUR FREAKING TEETH RIGHT NOW! \nNope. Nada. \nHusband: Did you hear your mom? Go brush your teeth. \nTiny feet scamper off to brush their teeth, and I am once again completely dumfounded, a tiny bit grateful, and annoyed beyond words. \nWhat the ever-loving fuck?! Why are my children unable to hear the sound of my voice? And why do they listen to their father, and not me? What the fuckity fuck?! \nI feel like a stand-up comedian awkwardly tapping the mic \u2014 Hello! Is this thing on? Sometimes I wonder if the words that are coming out of my mouth have gotten jumbled up on the way out and have been translated into another language. Maybe the pitch of my voice is one that can only be heard by dogs and wild animals. Maybe I\u2019m like that teacher in all the Peanuts movies droning on with her whah-wha-wha-wha-whah instructions. \nBecause my kids suffer from Selective Listening Syndrome, it\u2019s no wonder I have to yell so much. My kids literally do not hear me unless I am yelling so loudly that the dogs run out of the room. Polite request? I get nothing. Touching their shoulder while talking? Meh, sometimes. If I didn\u2019t lose my shit and scream questions and requests at the top of my lungs sometimes, we would literally get nothing done and go nowhere. \nIt\u2019s a little hard not to take their subpar listening skills personally, but something tells me I\u2019m not alone in this struggle. Maybe the problem isn\u2019t me , but them. Maybe it\u2019s because they\u2019re kids and kids don\u2019t listen, or maybe it\u2019s because they\u2019re boys and everyone knows that males have a tiny problem with listening. Science says so. No, really, it does . \nA few years ago, a study came out finding that males have a harder time hearing women\u2019s voices because they have to use a different part of their brain to process the sound of the female voice. Apparently, men need to use the part of the brain that processes music to decipher the female voice, which is a more complex process than that of deciphering a male voice. \nSo maybe the answer is to start singing everything. In fact, I may or may not have sung \u201cGet your shoes, we need to go, we are late, we are late\u201d to the tune of \u201cLet It Go\u201d on occasion. \nI\u2019ve heard all about the Orange Rhinos and the moms who quit yelling , and honestly, that just makes me more bewildered and frustrated. Who are these special unicorns whose children listen to them when they speak at a normal decibel? And what is wrong with my heathen children who don\u2019t respond unless I\u2019m screaming so loud my throat hurts? What is wrong with me that my children ignore me the five times I ask them to do something, but listen the first time my husband says something? \nI\u2019m not asking for answers, folks, so you can save your suggestions about giving my children warnings, whispering to them, or getting on their eye level when talking to them. I\u2019ve heard all the advice, thankyouverymuch, and in the grand scheme of things, my kids are good kids. There is nothing \u201cwrong\u201d with them. They aren\u2019t disrespectful or mean; they just get consumed with whatever it is they\u2019re doing and block out the sound of my voice sometimes. \nAnd there\u2019s nothing \u201cwrong\u201d with me either, or you, if your kids suffer from Selective Listening Syndrome too. We\u2019re good moms who nag our kids now and then like any good mother should. Sometimes, we just need to vent from one ignored mom to another, amirite? \nAnd this Selective Listening Syndrome doesn\u2019t just apply to my requests for them to pick up their shoes, take a shower, or put away their clothes. I would almost understand if their ears simply turned off whenever I asked them to do something they didn\u2019t want to do, but they also can\u2019t seem to hear me asking them about things they might want. Do you want some breakfast? I get nothing. What do you want to drink? Nada. Anyone want a cookie? Okay, so I\u2019m kind of glad they don\u2019t always hear that last one. \nNow that I think about it, maybe Selective Listening Syndrome isn\u2019t such a bad thing after all, because muttering FTS under my breath while stress-eating a Kit Kat bar is a lot more fun when no one is listening.", "crawled": "2017-04-11T04:34:50.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-11T04:34:50.000+03:00", "uuid": "cc1a2d9c3a3497a2b641bbef9e66ee3ebd1fe843", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 886, "likes": 886}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "scarymommy.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.scarymommy.com/feed/", "uuid": "cc1a2d9c3a3497a2b641bbef9e66ee3ebd1fe843", "section_title": "Scary Mommy", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 8, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8C1Q610nHYYevCfzN9JDN6l682ZdrDYIIOXmVMQK.IF_0evnk4Bogp", "domain_rank": 10926, "main_image": "http://www.scarymommy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/shutterstock_501127897.jpg", "site_full": "www.scarymommy.com", "title_full": "Why Don\u2019t My Kids Hear Me When I Talk?", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Why Don\u2019t My Kids Hear Me When I Talk?", "published": "2017-04-11T04:34:50.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "christine organ"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "nada"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "orange rhinos"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8C1Q610nHYYevCfzN9JDN6l682ZdrDYIIOXmVMQK.IF_0evnk4Bogp", "author": "Christine Organ", "external_links": [], "title": "Why Don\u2019t My Kids Hear Me When I Talk?", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Interest-Based Ads \u00a9 Disney.

These Awesome Teens Just Invented Solar-Powered Shelters for the Homeless Karen Johnson Image Source: Violet Mardirosian \nFor all the griping you hear about teenagers, many of them care deeply about their world. And that\u2019s certainly evident at San Fernando High School, a math, science, and technology magnet school in the Los Angeles area that educates such promising young people every day. In fact, 12 of the school\u2019s junior and senior girls have spent the last year working on a grant-funded project to create solar-powered shelters for the homeless \u2014 and their work has been so impressive, they\u2019ve been given the opportunity to present their work at MIT this June. \nJust let that sink in for a minute. \nAll of the students are just 16 and 17 years old. Many of them come from low-income families, and are either the daughters of immigrants or immigrants themselves. And yet they\u2019ve come together and created energy-efficient shelters for those in their community who are less fortunate, without any place to live. Image Source: Violet Mardirosian \nBut in order to make it all the way to MIT to present their work, they need your help. The $10,000 Lemelson-MIT InvenTeam Grant, a sponsored program from the School of Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, covered the cost of building their invention, but does not provide the financial assistance necessary to send these awe-inspiring girls to Massachusetts this summer. The girls wanted \u2018to provide comfort and dignity\u2019 to those in their community who need it the most. Share Quote Facebook Pinterest \nViolet Mardirosian, a math teacher and magnet coordinator at San Fernando High, has worked with the team since the beginning. She credits former student and MIT graduate Evelyn Gomez with suggesting the formation of an \u201cInvenTeam\u201d and applying for the grant. \nAfter discussing the idea with her students, 12 girls came forward with their vision. But like all STEM-related inventions, there was a lot of work to be done, and the girls\u2019 determination never wavered. Mardirosian tells Babble the group is endlessly researching, working, writing, testing, and re-testing to get it right, and that the team has given presentations to their school, as well as to engineers, to help develop their public speaking skills in preparation for June. Image Source: Violet Mardirosian \nBut because there\u2019s not a grade associated with this project, Mardirosian explains that the girls are working on the project outside of their regular curriculum, after school and on weekends. In fact, Mardirosian says she and the girls will be in the building every day this week working on the shelters \u2014 even though it\u2019s their spring break. When asked what motivates these ambitious students to keep going, she beams, saying it\u2019s \u201ctheir drive and compassion.\u201d Mardirosian tells Babble that the girls wanted \u201cto provide comfort and dignity\u201d to those in their community who need it the most. Related Post Eye-Opening Experiment Highlights the Lack of Female Characters in Children's Books \nMake no mistake, that\u2019s pretty incredible. Twelve bright and courageous girls saw a need. They recognized that the San Fernando Valley has seen a 36 percent increase in homelessness within the last year that affects more than 7,100 residents and took action on a problem declared by local leaders to be a \u201cstate of emergency.\u201d Their determination is inspiring on its own, but their story also proves that exposure to STEM-related opportunities matter , and it sends an important message to young girls around our nation: engineering is for girls. Image Source: Violet Mardirosian \nThe amazing DIY Girls InvenTeam deserves the opportunity of presenting their work in person at EurekaFest this summer, but they can\u2019t get their on their own. The group\u2019s GoFundMe page has a goal set at $15,000, but Mardirosian explains this financial goal represents the bare minimum, admitting the trip could cost more.

Researchers at the Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China found that a class of pesticide called pyrethroid accounted for more than 30% of pesticide use around the world. Pyrethroids are commonly used both indoors and outdoors to kill mosquitoes and other bugs. The chemical is also sprayed on crops. Residential use and food intake were associated with pyrethroid in humans. Lead researcher Dr. Jing Liu said residues of this pesticide are most commonly found in milk, baby food, and vegetables . The chemical is a known endocrine-disruptor that affects the body\u2019s hormones. Pyrethroid exposure in humans can be detected in urine as a metabolite, or molecule, called 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA). \nFor the study, researchers examined 463 Chinese boys ages nine to 16 years, and found that each 10% increase in 3-PBA was tied to a 4% increase in the levels of luteinizing hormones and follicle-stimulating hormones in participants. Both hormones are responsible for stimulating testosterone production in males.

Early puberty was also associated with an increased risk of other adverse medical conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome, arthritis, glaucoma, and psoriasis. The condition was also tied to elevated risk of depression in both men and women, and premature menopause in women. \nFurthermore, researchers found that participants who had the earliest onset of puberty had higher odds of developing diseases later in life compared with those who had later onsets. These participants were also at a 50% increased risk of heart disease, type-2 diabetes, and poor overall health. \n\u201cUp until now, the link between early puberty and risk of disease has been blamed on weight and obesity, but our findings suggest that men and women of a normal weight who go through puberty relatively early or late may also carry these risks.

Researchers at the Zhejiang University in Hangzhou, China found that a class of pesticide called pyrethroid accounted for more than 30% of pesticide use around the world. Pyrethroids are commonly used both indoors and outdoors to kill mosquitoes and other bugs. The chemical is also sprayed on crops. Residential use and food intake were associated with pyrethroid in humans. Lead researcher Dr. Jing Liu said residues of this pesticide are most commonly found in milk, baby food, and vegetables . The chemical is a known endocrine-disruptor that affects the body\u2019s hormones. Pyrethroid exposure in humans can be detected in urine as a metabolite, or molecule, called 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA). \nFor the study, researchers examined 463 Chinese boys ages nine to 16 years, and found that each 10% increase in 3-PBA was tied to a 4% increase in the levels of luteinizing hormones and follicle-stimulating hormones in participants. Both hormones are responsible for stimulating testosterone production in males.

He, along with Robert DeNiro, made a $100,000 offer to anyone who can provide a peer reviewed scientific study stating that thimerosal, a mercury containing preservative , \u201cis safe in the amounts contained in vaccines currently being administered to American children and pregnant women.\u201d Health Ranger Mike Adams has also chimed in on this subject with his own challenge. \nWhile we understand that children are the most vulnerable to the toxic effects of vaccines , the idea that H.R. 1313 could be used to force employees to take whatever vaccine their employer deemed necessary means that all are vulnerable to the pharmaceutical vaccine cartel and their sorcery. It\u2019s imperative to keep informed and stand against their medical tyranny. \nSources:", "crawled": "2017-04-03T09:37:31.534+03:00", "published": "2017-04-03T03:36:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "e3b3234bd01c743c30d9db59bc6eed587a6301b1", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 537, "likes": 537}, "gplus": {"shares": 15}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}}, "country": "US", "site": "naturalnews.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.naturalnews.com/rss.xml", "uuid": "e3b3234bd01c743c30d9db59bc6eed587a6301b1", "section_title": "NaturalNews.com", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 5, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_sejtWCbZc4MoE7EUHucFe2XkQogjQWfnjXaywA0li1v1Glw22ksHUhXI2625wZogjJX8VbwX6_P5hZJM7eaDOF7dJ8LKmqTjXr7cDBTKhX9nR6HNUfSCqP_Ny7dbRpI8IWSHKYYsGwqKSKgUJfCyKaszU1NV3oZkL7THZlBJxCg--", "domain_rank": 6416, "main_image": "http://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2017/03/vaccine-e1465544739110.jpg", "site_full": "www.naturalnews.com", "title_full": "The insane vaccine industry now wants you FIRED from your job if you aren't vaccinated", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "The insane vaccine industry now wants you FIRED from your job if you aren't vaccinated", "published": "2017-04-03T03:36:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_sejtWCbZc4MoE7EUHucFe2XkQogjQWfnjXaywA0li1v1Glw22ksHUhXI2625wZogjJX8VbwX6_P5hZJM7eaDOF7dJ8LKmqTjXr7cDBTKhX9nR6HNUfSCqP_Ny7dbRpI8IWSHKYYsGwqKSKgUJfCyKaszU1NV3oZkL7THZlBJxCg--", "author": "D.

Tags: organic farming , organic food , pesticides \n( Natural News ) If you were buying organic food ten years ago, more than one acquaintance probably rolled their eyes at you and said you were being taken advantage of by a savvy marketing ploy. Over time, however, attitudes have started to shift as more people become aware of the impact that fruit and vegetables grown with pesticides can have on your health as well as the environment. Now, many of those same skeptics who once gave you a hard time about your choices are stocking their own pantries with organic food. \nAccording to a Nielsen survey, the vast majority of American households \u2013 82.3 percent, to be exact \u2013 had organic items in their refrigerators and pantries in 2016. This marks a 3.4 percent rise over 2015\u2019s figures. \nThey reached their conclusions after studying 100,000 households in every state except Hawaii and Alaska. The biggest jump was seen in North Dakota, where 14.2 percent more households are buying organic than a year ago, while Rhode Island noted a rise of 12.3 percent. Other states to note big jumps included Wyoming, which is up 10.8 percent, and South Dakota, which noted a 10 percent rise. \nWhile sales figures for the American organic market from 2016 are not yet available, the total amount of organic food sales noted in 2015 was $43.3 billion, which was 11 percent higher than 2014, according to a press release from the Organic Trade Association. This far outperformed the overall food market during the year, which only grew by 3 percent. The fresh beverage subcategory was the fastest growing, noting a 33.5 percent rise, while dairy noted an increase of more than 10 percent. \nThe rise is even more dramatic when long-term figures are considered. For example, spending on organic food has jumped by 72 percent since 2008. (RELATED: Follow more news on organics at Organics.news .) Farmers can\u2019t keep up with demand \nFarmers are struggling to meet the growing demand for organic food as they scramble to earn organic certification for their fields, a process that can take upward of three years. Experts have referred to the situation as a \u201cgold rush mentality.\u201d Right now, more farmers in the country than ever before have earned organic certification , signifying that their crops do not contain chemical fertilizers or pesticides. While organic crops have risen by 11 percent over the last two years to cover in excess of 4 million acres of American farmland, it is still not enough to meet the demand. In fact, our country imports organically-grown grain to feed the cows that produce organic milk because not enough is grown domestically. This has led some people to grow their own fruits and vegetables for peace of mind. \nA new plan for classifying organic products was recently approved by the USDA, and it is expected to inspire more farmers to get on board. Even though organic food can command a much higher price tag, the process of transitioning places it out of reach for many farmers. \nFarmers must discontinue the use of fertilizer and chemical pesticides for three years, and during that period, they often lose a lot of money. Under the new plan, farmers undergoing the transition could label their products as \u201ctransitional,\u201d which would enable them to charge a slightly higher price for their goods and recoup some of the expenses associated with the process. \nConsumers are making their preference clear. As people become increasingly health-conscious, more and more farmers can see the future of the agriculture industry, and conventionally grown produce is not part of it. The health risks of food grown with pesticides are downright scary, and people are no longer willing to spend money on these foods or put them in their bodies. \nSources include:", "crawled": "2017-04-02T02:47:44.153+03:00", "published": "2017-04-01T18:21:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "4264b5ab6fecaad11833cc050a13fc6a58b450a3", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 992, "likes": 992}, "gplus": {"shares": 14}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}}, "country": "US", "site": "naturalnews.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.naturalnews.com/rss.xml", "uuid": "4264b5ab6fecaad11833cc050a13fc6a58b450a3", "section_title": "NaturalNews.com", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 9, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_sejtWCbZc4MoE7EUHucFe2XkQogjQWfliLxH1ud4Hi3xx83SqrNlmc0EgNnENiu_qktRv5IbnTljpOXVZOSvKfogP4cbToblBj3Qw.LJH63ethrvXe0TJ", "domain_rank": 6416, "main_image": "http://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2017/03/Farmers-Market-Organic-Produce-Veggies-And-Fruits.jpg", "site_full": "www.naturalnews.com", "title_full": "82% of households are now purchasing organic items", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "82% of households are now purchasing organic items", "published": "2017-04-01T18:21:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_sejtWCbZc4MoE7EUHucFe2XkQogjQWfliLxH1ud4Hi3xx83SqrNlmc0EgNnENiu_qktRv5IbnTljpOXVZOSvKfogP4cbToblBj3Qw.LJH63ethrvXe0TJ", "author": "Isabelle Z.", "external_links": [], "title": "82% of households are now purchasing organic items", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Tags: food , food safety , Foods , rice \n( Natural News ) Experts warned that eating leftover rice may yield to food poisoning. Cooking rice does not always destroy all the pathogens residing on it. There is also a higher risk of food poisoning when rice is left at room temperature . \nDr. Bejamin Chapman, North Carolina State University\u2019s resident Food Safety Specialist, said in an interview that a pathogen is prevalent in dried rice, most likely as spores. This pathogen is known as Bacillus cereus . It is commonly found in soil and food. However, some pathogenic strains are known to cause harm to humans and may cause food-borne diseases. \nAccording to Dr. Chapman, these spores can survive even when cooked. If the rice is stored at room temperature after cooking, the spores can grow and propagate. Food poisoning happens because these bacterial spores survive. It is probably that cooked rice is a great breeding place for the spores, as it has water and nutrients. \nAs soon as these spores germinate, they release toxins which include those resistant to heat. Although it is not clear how many infection incidents of Bacillus cereus there are, a report suggest that it constitutes to two percent of food-borne diseases. \nA study published in Epidemiology and Infection stated that boiled rice must be kept hot (more than 63 degrees Celsius) or cooled immediately, and be placed in a refrigerator within two hours from cooking. Fried or boiled rice must not be kept under warm conditions, specifically in the range of 15-50 degrees Celsius. This temperature is ideal for the bacteria to multiply. \nMeanwhile, Dr. Donald Shaffner, Rutger University\u2019s food scientist, warned that there are restaurants that cook a big batch of rice then keep it at room temperature all day. It will then be consumed or served as needed. This may lead to outbreaks such as food poisoning. The best way to fend off this kind of food poisoning is to refrigerate rice leftovers two hours after cooking . \nHowever, it is not always the case, as sushi rice can be stored at room temperature without the chance of food poisoning. Sushi rice has vinegar, which gives it its acidic property not ideal for bacterial growth. Foods you must not reheat \nWhile on the subject of leftovers, here is the list of the foods you must not reheat. These foods cause food poisoning , especially if they were incorrectly stored. \nPotatoes \u2013 Potatoes must be immediately refrigerated. If they are left to cool down at room temperature, a bacteria known as Clostridium botulinum may develop. It can lead to botulism; a rare disease that could lead to paralysis. \nMushrooms \u2013 Mushrooms must be consumed at least 24 hours after they are prepared. Mushrooms are rich in proteins, but proteins quickly deteriorate as soon as you slice the mushroom. It is safe to eat mushrooms if they are reheated at a high temperature. \nEggs \u2013 Eggs may be reheated, but it must be done properly. When reheating, eggs should reach an internal temperature of 74 degrees Celsius to ensure they are safe for consumption. It is wise to skip reheating eggs in the microwave if you do not have a food thermometer. \nChicken \u2013 Reheating chicken might lead to digestive problems. The protein composition of the meat may be altered during reheating. \nSpinach, celery, and beets \u2013 Spinach, celery, and beets contain high levels of nitrates that can be carcinogenic when reheated. This happens when these foods are heated, stored, then reheated. Other considerations \n\u2013 If you think the food is not cooked properly, do not reheat it. Instead, cook it again. \n\u2013 Always check if the microwave is working perfectly. \n\u2013 Stir the food in the microwave to facilitate even temperature in every part. \n\u2013 To ensure an even, thorough reheating, make sure to cut foods into smaller portions. \nSources:", "crawled": "2017-04-02T02:47:43.016+03:00", "published": "2017-04-01T18:34:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "6bce5619092cda413446aa1747dbfc55ee8bc46f", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 790, "likes": 790}, "gplus": {"shares": 20}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 12}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 8}}, "country": "US", "site": "naturalnews.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.naturalnews.com/rss.xml", "uuid": "6bce5619092cda413446aa1747dbfc55ee8bc46f", "section_title": "NaturalNews.com", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 7, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_sejtWCbZc4MoE7EUHucFe2XkQogjQWflkIulayCRwte0xx5ag3KUBLDUDsKnaACFHdecnzkber_A8SJfCTVggTYO1CN2dERUODURCxEcO3_oRgUtBjDMRgJajdTyDSVYiMSpbbUR8yokH2NoQa0wL", "domain_rank": 6416, "main_image": "http://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2017/04/bowl-of-rice.jpg", "site_full": "www.naturalnews.com", "title_full": "Avoid these leftovers lurking in your fridge, they could make you sick", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Avoid these leftovers lurking in your fridge, they could make you sick", "published": "2017-04-01T18:34:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_sejtWCbZc4MoE7EUHucFe2XkQogjQWflkIulayCRwte0xx5ag3KUBLDUDsKnaACFHdecnzkber_A8SJfCTVggTYO1CN2dERUODURCxEcO3_oRgUtBjDMRgJajdTyDSVYiMSpbbUR8yokH2NoQa0wL", "author": "Gregory Van Dyke", "external_links": [], "title": "Avoid these leftovers lurking in your fridge, they could make you sick", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "By Robert Lowes \nApril 1, 2017 -- The U.S. has joined the list of countries covered by a voluntary recall of EpiPen auto-injectors for severe allergic reactions . \nThe recall was triggered by a defective part that may result in the device failing to inject a potentially life-saving dose of epinephrine , the FDA said Friday. \nMylan, the company that markets the device, announced last month that it was recalling one lot of roughly 80,000 EpiPens in Australia, Europe, Japan, and New Zealand.

Pressing the EpiPen into a person's thigh \u2014 where the pen is designed for use \u2014 causes a needle to penetrate skin and inject epinephrine into muscle. The defective part may require a person to use increased force to activate the needle, or it may prevent the EpiPen from working at all, according to Mylan. \nIn the United States, the recall applies to 13 lots of both EpiPen and EpiPen Jr. auto-injectors distributed between December 17, 2015, and July 1, 2016.

Tags: organic farming , organic food , pesticides \n( Natural News ) If you were buying organic food ten years ago, more than one acquaintance probably rolled their eyes at you and said you were being taken advantage of by a savvy marketing ploy. Over time, however, attitudes have started to shift as more people become aware of the impact that fruit and vegetables grown with pesticides can have on your health as well as the environment. Now, many of those same skeptics who once gave you a hard time about your choices are stocking their own pantries with organic food. \nAccording to a Nielsen survey, the vast majority of American households \u2013 82.3 percent, to be exact \u2013 had organic items in their refrigerators and pantries in 2016. This marks a 3.4 percent rise over 2015\u2019s figures. \nThey reached their conclusions after studying 100,000 households in every state except Hawaii and Alaska. The biggest jump was seen in North Dakota, where 14.2 percent more households are buying organic than a year ago, while Rhode Island noted a rise of 12.3 percent. Other states to note big jumps included Wyoming, which is up 10.8 percent, and South Dakota, which noted a 10 percent rise. \nWhile sales figures for the American organic market from 2016 are not yet available, the total amount of organic food sales noted in 2015 was $43.3 billion, which was 11 percent higher than 2014, according to a press release from the Organic Trade Association. This far outperformed the overall food market during the year, which only grew by 3 percent. The fresh beverage subcategory was the fastest growing, noting a 33.5 percent rise, while dairy noted an increase of more than 10 percent. \nThe rise is even more dramatic when long-term figures are considered. For example, spending on organic food has jumped by 72 percent since 2008. (RELATED: Follow more news on organics at Organics.news .) Farmers can\u2019t keep up with demand \nFarmers are struggling to meet the growing demand for organic food as they scramble to earn organic certification for their fields, a process that can take upward of three years. Experts have referred to the situation as a \u201cgold rush mentality.\u201d Right now, more farmers in the country than ever before have earned organic certification , signifying that their crops do not contain chemical fertilizers or pesticides. While organic crops have risen by 11 percent over the last two years to cover in excess of 4 million acres of American farmland, it is still not enough to meet the demand. In fact, our country imports organically-grown grain to feed the cows that produce organic milk because not enough is grown domestically. This has led some people to grow their own fruits and vegetables for peace of mind. \nA new plan for classifying organic products was recently approved by the USDA, and it is expected to inspire more farmers to get on board. Even though organic food can command a much higher price tag, the process of transitioning places it out of reach for many farmers. \nFarmers must discontinue the use of fertilizer and chemical pesticides for three years, and during that period, they often lose a lot of money. Under the new plan, farmers undergoing the transition could label their products as \u201ctransitional,\u201d which would enable them to charge a slightly higher price for their goods and recoup some of the expenses associated with the process. \nConsumers are making their preference clear. As people become increasingly health-conscious, more and more farmers can see the future of the agriculture industry, and conventionally grown produce is not part of it. The health risks of food grown with pesticides are downright scary, and people are no longer willing to spend money on these foods or put them in their bodies. \nSources include:", "crawled": "2017-04-01T21:02:53.914+03:00", "published": "2017-04-01T18:21:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "84252c589df938bd032390f38abbb857c6175aa4", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 992, "likes": 992}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}}, "country": "US", "site": "naturalnews.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://naturalnews.com/rss.xml", "uuid": "84252c589df938bd032390f38abbb857c6175aa4", "section_title": "NaturalNews.com", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 9, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXUmbhBqaECsm7h5AXk2lXXmde8HmdxjVbPdP_xLs9OYmXrc9iclP2eYxvjtmD_cKNvciXW.76ZK.Tph9U0dOcVa0nADfML5Cu.kskI4vr2UiI7A6YcGmK9", "domain_rank": 6416, "main_image": "http://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2017/03/Farmers-Market-Organic-Produce-Veggies-And-Fruits.jpg", "site_full": "naturalnews.com", "title_full": "82% of households are now purchasing organic items", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "82% of households are now purchasing organic items", "published": "2017-04-01T18:21:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "wyoming"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "north dakota"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "rhode island"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "hawaii"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "alaska"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "south dakota"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "positive", "name": "isabelle z. tags"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "nielsen"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "organic trade association"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "organics.news"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "usda"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXUmbhBqaECsm7h5AXk2lXXmde8HmdxjVbPdP_xLs9OYmXrc9iclP2eYxvjtmD_cKNvciXW.76ZK.Tph9U0dOcVa0nADfML5Cu.kskI4vr2UiI7A6YcGmK9", "author": "Isabelle Z.", "external_links": [], "title": "82% of households are now purchasing organic items", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Tags: food , food safety , Foods , rice \n( Natural News ) Experts warned that eating leftover rice may yield to food poisoning. Cooking rice does not always destroy all the pathogens residing on it. There is also a higher risk of food poisoning when rice is left at room temperature . \nDr. Bejamin Chapman, North Carolina State University\u2019s resident Food Safety Specialist, said in an interview that a pathogen is prevalent in dried rice, most likely as spores. This pathogen is known as Bacillus cereus . It is commonly found in soil and food. However, some pathogenic strains are known to cause harm to humans and may cause food-borne diseases. \nAccording to Dr. Chapman, these spores can survive even when cooked. If the rice is stored at room temperature after cooking, the spores can grow and propagate. Food poisoning happens because these bacterial spores survive. It is probably that cooked rice is a great breeding place for the spores, as it has water and nutrients. \nAs soon as these spores germinate, they release toxins which include those resistant to heat. Although it is not clear how many infection incidents of Bacillus cereus there are, a report suggest that it constitutes to two percent of food-borne diseases. \nA study published in Epidemiology and Infection stated that boiled rice must be kept hot (more than 63 degrees Celsius) or cooled immediately, and be placed in a refrigerator within two hours from cooking.

These foods cause food poisoning , especially if they were incorrectly stored. \nPotatoes \u2013 Potatoes must be immediately refrigerated. If they are left to cool down at room temperature, a bacteria known as Clostridium botulinum may develop. It can lead to botulism; a rare disease that could lead to paralysis. \nMushrooms \u2013 Mushrooms must be consumed at least 24 hours after they are prepared. Mushrooms are rich in proteins, but proteins quickly deteriorate as soon as you slice the mushroom. It is safe to eat mushrooms if they are reheated at a high temperature. \nEggs \u2013 Eggs may be reheated, but it must be done properly. When reheating, eggs should reach an internal temperature of 74 degrees Celsius to ensure they are safe for consumption. It is wise to skip reheating eggs in the microwave if you do not have a food thermometer. \nChicken \u2013 Reheating chicken might lead to digestive problems. The protein composition of the meat may be altered during reheating. \nSpinach, celery, and beets \u2013 Spinach, celery, and beets contain high levels of nitrates that can be carcinogenic when reheated. This happens when these foods are heated, stored, then reheated. Other considerations \n\u2013 If you think the food is not cooked properly, do not reheat it. Instead, cook it again. \n\u2013 Always check if the microwave is working perfectly. \n\u2013 Stir the food in the microwave to facilitate even temperature in every part. \n\u2013 To ensure an even, thorough reheating, make sure to cut foods into smaller portions. \nSources:", "crawled": "2017-04-01T21:02:52.543+03:00", "published": "2017-04-01T18:34:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "966c718a10f7d08a5818c4df7a6c9ec231b15d76", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 790, "likes": 790}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 8}}, "country": "US", "site": "naturalnews.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://naturalnews.com/rss.xml", "uuid": "966c718a10f7d08a5818c4df7a6c9ec231b15d76", "section_title": "NaturalNews.com", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 7, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXUmbhBqaECsm7h5AXk2lXXmde8HmdxjVZbmcebnrPHG3x9wCccNcRYBXKq16KMPv1BxEKyKq1_N3qln_zuH.vusturKsWmgm5kzBzth4fj_0EHkMUYd7KHabA3sTyfYv4mn0iFy_63ew--", "domain_rank": 6416, "main_image": "http://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2017/04/bowl-of-rice.jpg", "site_full": "naturalnews.com", "title_full": "Avoid these leftovers lurking in your fridge, they could make you sick", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Avoid these leftovers lurking in your fridge, they could make you sick", "published": "2017-04-01T18:34:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "bacillus"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "donald shaffner"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "bejamin chapman"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "chapman"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "rutger university"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "north carolina state university"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXUmbhBqaECsm7h5AXk2lXXmde8HmdxjVZbmcebnrPHG3x9wCccNcRYBXKq16KMPv1BxEKyKq1_N3qln_zuH.vusturKsWmgm5kzBzth4fj_0EHkMUYd7KHabA3sTyfYv4mn0iFy_63ew--", "author": "Gregory Van Dyke", "external_links": [], "title": "Avoid these leftovers lurking in your fridge, they could make you sick", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Rina Mae Acosta and Michele Hutchison Mar 31, 2017 \nLazy Sundays are an absolute must in our household. In any case, most places are closed, or open only in the afternoon \u2014 if you\u2019re lucky. Bram will be busy in the kitchen, preparing an elaborate breakfast, and I\u2019ll be on the couch in the living room, breastfeeding Matteo and planning our afternoon nature walk. Julius will be in his room, playing on his own with his Duplo. \nToday, the morning sunshine and crisp fall air outside have put us in a good mood. Bram is making wentelteefjes , the Dutch version of French toast, which he serves with goat cheese and strawberries, mango and blueberries. I\u2019m looking up local trails on which to hunt for fly agaric, those elusive red mushrooms with white dots on them. Until I moved to the Netherlands, I thought that these red mushrooms belonged in the fantasy world of Super Mario Brothers , in fairy tales, or with garden gnomes. It turns out they grow plentifully here, and are known for their toxicity and hallucinogenic properties. We\u2019re on a mission simply to admire these beauties from a distance. \n\u201cMy love, take a look at this,\u201d cries out Bram from the kitchen-dining area. \nI turn my head toward the table. Julius is sitting in his high chair, an infectious grin on his face. Our 3-year-old has helped himself to breakfast. In front of him is a piece of bread piled high with unsalted butter and hagelslag \u2014 chocolate sprinkles. \n\u201cNo wonder Dutch kids are the happiest kids in the world,\u201d I think to myself. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t be happy if they could have chocolate first thing every morning?\u201d \nI can already hear gasps of disapproval and disdain from the perfect moms of the internet. Chocolate for breakfast? You wouldn\u2019t think that starting the morning with a sugar rush would be a brilliant idea. And he\u2019s created a horrible mess. Butter is smeared all over his high chair, as well as his face and hands, and there are chocolate sprinkles all over the floor. \nMy husband and I look at each other. Shall we reprimand him? Instead, we burst out laughing and count it as another sanctimommy fail. Obliv\u00adious, Julius starts gobbling his hagelslag sandwich, and my husband snaps a picture of his happy face. Breakfast of champions \nSo is there something special about eating hagelslag for breakfast? Is that really what makes Dutch children so happy? Judging by the reac\u00adtions of American kids on a fascinating BuzzFeed video inviting them to try traditional breakfasts from around the world, it was clear that this Dutch breakfast had won their hearts. What kid wouldn\u2019t want to eat breakfast every morning if chocolate was on the menu? But kids in other countries also eat sugar-laden foods, often in the form of cereal \u2014 Coco Pops spring to mind. No, I think it\u2019s more about the fact that the Dutch eat breakfast as a family. \nAccording to the 2013 UNICEF report \u2014 the one that suggested that Dutch kids were the happiest in the world \u2014 85% of the Dutch children aged 11, 13 and 15 surveyed ate breakfast every day. Sitting down to eat around the table as a family, before school and the working day, is a routine that underpins Dutch family life. In no other country do families eat breakfast together as regularly as they do in the Netherlands. I\u2019m aware that, in American and British families, breakfast is a meal that\u2019s often skipped altogether, in the rush to get out of the house on time. \nWhat the Dutch seem to understand is the importance of eating reg\u00adular meals, starting with the meal that breaks the nighttime fast. There\u2019s an abundance of research that points out the benefits of having break\u00adfast every morning: It\u2019s said to reduce the risk of snacking on unhealthy foods throughout the day, decrease the risk of obesity and increase a child\u2019s ability to concentrate at school. The Dutch are champions of breakfast time and seem to be happier and healthier because of it. But the real point is that they put as much value on the idea of starting the day together around the breakfast table, a calming and bonding experi\u00adence for all the family. A healthy, balanced diet? \nI was surprised that chocolate sprinkles are the centerpiece of breakfast across the Netherlands. Didn\u2019t the Dutch know about the importance of a well-balanced diet low in fat and sugar? It\u2019s true the Dutch have built a reputation, especially among expats, of preparing and eating stodgy, uninspiring food. Perhaps the best way to describe the Dutch approach to eating is that it\u2019s utilitarian: Foods should be easy and quick to pre\u00adpare, affordable and nutritious. The only difference between a typical Dutch lunch and a typical Dutch breakfast is the three hours in between: Both are based on open sandwiches. Dinner, the only meal that is eaten hot, is often referred to as the holy trinity of meat, a vegetable and a car\u00adbohydrate. Haute cuisine it ain\u2019t. \nYet, according to recent research, the Dutch no-nonsense approach to eating may be the way to go. An Oxfam study undertaken in 2014 declared that the Netherlands had \u201cthe best food in the world.\u201d Oxfam, an organization working to fight global poverty, looked at four cri\u00adteria: whether there was a plentiful supply of food, how affordable it was, whether it was good quality, and whether it caused high rates of obesity and diabetes. The UK came in 10th. The US was way below, in 21st place, because although food in the US scored high in affordability and quality, the country\u2019s ranking was brought down by the high incidence of obesity and diabetes. \nThe UNICEF report supports Oxfam\u2019s claim. Dutch children had the lowest obesity rates of all the 29 industrialized countries sur\u00adveyed. Only 8.36% of Dutch children aged 11, 13 and 15 were deemed obese. Sadly, in every country except for three \u2014 the Netherlands, Denmark and Switzerland \u2014 childhood levels of obesity are now over 10%. The results show that the best place to eat in the world is not France, somewhere in the Mediterranean, or Japan, but right here in the Netherlands. In spite of all that butter, bread and hagelslag , the Dutch eat a healthy, balanced diet that\u2019s pretty much affordable to everyone. \nThis morning, as we watch our toddler happily eat his Dutch break\u00adfast, his head swaying blissfully from side to side, his legs kicking to and fro, I finally realize what hagelslag is all about. Pausing for a moment and just looking at him, silencing all the neurotic and anxious voices in my head, I understand that, apart from his obvious enjoyment of the sweet taste of chocolate, my 3-year-old son is content and proud to be able to choose and prepare his own breakfast. This translates into self-confidence. It really is all about the hagelslag .", "crawled": "2017-04-01T06:11:49.010+03:00", "published": "2017-04-01T06:11:49.010+03:00", "uuid": "cb9b80e774706199ef53b1576d4a8b0ad5ac4475", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 503, "likes": 503}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "scarymommy.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.scarymommy.com/feed/", "uuid": "cb9b80e774706199ef53b1576d4a8b0ad5ac4475", "section_title": "Scary Mommy", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 5, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8C1Q610nHYYevCfzN9JDN6A7VGWbWlrrKYrHtesbe4KWPGvUtIIzaIxVs1evfzR.d9chm0Dz6JOGr0d9Gbw4Mk", "domain_rank": 10926, "main_image": "http://www.scarymommy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/happiest-kids-in-world.jpg", "site_full": "www.scarymommy.com", "title_full": "Why Are Dutch Kids The Happiest In The World?

It was a fat guy on a surf board, and it said something like, \u201cWhen you give up on your diet and just say \u2018fuck it, I\u2019m fat.'\u201d They could\u2019ve used a picture of me \u2014 it\u2019s so me. \nNow, I know how I\u2019m supposed to feel. I\u2019m supposed to be sad that I\u2019m fat. I\u2019m supposed to sit by looking morose as my daughter runs and plays while I can\u2019t keep up. I\u2019m supposed to have an epiphany in the Safeway checkout line upon seeing the Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition and be inspired to \u201cdo better for myself,\u201d join a gym, lose weight, and then blog about my experience so I can be a \u201cthinspiration\u201d to others. \nThing is, I get twitchy when society starts laying what I\u2019m supposed to do on me. Then I start having this problem where I just can\u2019t seem to keep my middle fingers down. \nSo instead, maybe I can be someone\u2019s FATspiration. Here\u2019s my \u201cjourney to self-love\u201d or whatever self-help BS thing you want to call it. \nI haven\u2019t always felt the way I do now. The first time it occurred to me that I was fat, I was in the third grade. I don\u2019t remember why it occurred to me. Maybe some kid at school said something. Maybe an elder relative made a remark about it. I was a pretty observant kid, so maybe I just looked around at the other girls in my class and figured it out. I don\u2019t know. But I do know that\u2019s when it all started. \nFrom that point throughout elementary school, I remember thinking I\u2019d \u201cgrow out of it.\u201d And I kind of did. In junior high, I was thinner, but not thin enough. I still had the poochy stomach, the wiggly parts. I was as tall as I am now (5-foot-2) and weighed about 135 pounds, which means I had a normal BMI and all that. But it was not normal compared to the \u201chot girls\u201d in school. And that damn stomach \u2014 I couldn\u2019t show that off. That\u2019s when I started experimenting with fasting. And that\u2019s when my inner mean girl started harping on me. \nThroughout high school, my weight went up and down. I wasn\u2019t satisfied with how I looked at all , but I just decided a bikini would never be in the cards for me and rolled with what I had. I was lucky to attend a small school where bullying, while not nonexistent, wasn\u2019t really all that bad. I had a super-smart mouth, though, and a self-deprecating sense of humor that probably didn\u2019t make me a very fun target in the first place. And even if there had been bullies, they couldn\u2019t have been any worse than my own inner dialogue. \nBy the time I graduated, I was in a relationship with the guy who would be my first husband, and I weighed 165 pounds. I remember thinking I was out of control and needed to do something. I fasted and took pills \u2014 a vicious cycle. \nThroughout my first marriage, my weight was a constant source of insecurity. I could not figure out why my husband wanted anything to do with me physically. That contributed to me being turned off by anything related to sex. I\u2019d exercise a while, fast, lose a little, gain it all back. I\u2019d get wrapped up in it to the point where it was just me and the fat \u2014 there wasn\u2019t room to think about much else. Nothing seemed to work. \nThen the doctor figured out that I had hypothyroidism \u2014 it was no wonder the weight wasn\u2019t coming off. You\u2019d think things would have gotten better from there, but nope. I broke my ankle (destroyed is probably a better word than broke) and was immobile for almost four months. In that time, I got fat as hell. When I got divorced, I weighed 250. \nWhile it wasn\u2019t the only reason we broke up, I mostly blamed my weight for the split. I was so depressed I could barely leave the house, but I put on a happy face for everyone else and soldiered on. I was so angry with myself for getting to that point and had nothing but pure hatred and contempt for my lack of self-discipline. \nAfter being divorced for a year, I went on the crashiest of crash diets and got down to nearly my high school weight. I got tons of compliments and started getting attention from men. It was great. They didn\u2019t need to know I was essentially starving myself, only eating 500 calories a day. I started partying my ass off, had a great time. But\u2026 \nWas I really happy? I was finally thinner, so wasn\u2019t I supposed to be gleeful as shit like those people holding up giant pants in the weight loss commercials? All that old self-hate, it wasn\u2019t gone. It had just shifted to other problem areas: \u201cYou\u2019re still not skinny, and no diet will ever make you pretty.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re still alone.\u201d \u201cThat guy is never gonna call you back. You\u2019re too weird.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be a broke-ass cat lady all your life.\u201d How could I ever win? \nThen I met my current husband. I fell in love with him and his kids, and we got married fairly quickly. I had my daughter. The birth of this kid was the single biggest catalyst in my life. After having her, the volume got turned way down on all the other shit that used to take up space in my head. Being fat didn\u2019t matter all that much anymore. All that mattered was taking care of this little person I\u2019d made and my little family. It made me re-evaluate happiness and what our society tells us about obtaining it. I realized there is no such thing as constant bliss \u2014 there\u2019s always going to be problems and bullshit no matter what. \nSo why did I want to complicate things further by carrying out this nonstop campaign of self-hatred I\u2019d waged in my head all my adult life? I thought about what that kind of attitude would do to my daughter as she observed me. Did I want to plague her with this \u201cnever good enough\u201d bullshit? She was already going to get it from literally everywhere else, and I didn\u2019t want to participate in it too. So I quit. \nI quit worrying about diets and finding time to squeeze in exercise somewhere. Quit worrying about my stupid jeans size. Quit worrying what people think of me. Quit feeling guilty about eating. Quit equating whether or not I was a good person with my size. Quit thinking that fat was the worst possible thing I could be. \nDid the self-hate completely go away? No, of course not. Am I 100% happy? Again, of course not. But now I realize that no one is, no matter how they look. I got over myself, got out of my own head, and started appreciating all the good stuff there is in life that\u2019s still there no matter what the scale says . Does this mean I\u2019ll never try again to lose weight? No, I might want to some day. But right now, that battle is just not on my to-do list. \nI know there are plenty of people who think I\u2019m lazy and undisciplined. They think I\u2019m driving their health care costs up since I\u2019m so \u201cunhealthy\u201d (I\u2019d like to compare doctor\u2019s visits in the past year with these people; I bet I\u2019ve been there less than they have). They think I\u2019m a drain on society. There was a time when I would\u2019ve agreed with them. But now? Now I just hope the sight of my fat ass out and about pisses them off so hard it wrecks their stupid little day. And then I can laugh and eat my cheeseburger.", "crawled": "2017-04-01T06:11:46.911+03:00", "published": "2017-04-01T06:11:46.911+03:00", "uuid": "6cd1740ae809bae223b747f5bccb0890020137d4", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 806, "likes": 806}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "scarymommy.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.scarymommy.com/feed/", "uuid": "6cd1740ae809bae223b747f5bccb0890020137d4", "section_title": "Scary Mommy", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 8, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8C1Q610nHYYevCfzN9JDN6H5FtMBS61ND7mNQ02gisNYnnUz1HJXj8OtwI8vlZs9bC9jpgqlue3w--", "domain_rank": 10926, "main_image": "http://www.scarymommy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/pexels-photo-185937.jpeg", "site_full": "www.scarymommy.com", "title_full": "F*ck It, I\u2019m Fat And I\u2019m Done Letting My Weight Rule My Life", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "F*ck It, I\u2019m Fat And I\u2019m Done Letting My Weight Rule My Life", "published": "2017-04-01T06:11:46.911+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "leann lovato"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "safeway"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8C1Q610nHYYevCfzN9JDN6H5FtMBS61ND7mNQ02gisNYnnUz1HJXj8OtwI8vlZs9bC9jpgqlue3w--", "author": "LeAnn Lovato", "external_links": [], "title": "F*ck It, I\u2019m Fat And I\u2019m Done Letting My Weight Rule My Life", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Katie Bingham-Smith Mar 31, 2017 \nI was nursing my 7-month-old daughter one afternoon before her nap. I was shaking, my legs were like jelly, and I had to sit down. Not only did I feel incredibly weak and light-headed, she kept turning away from me and refused to latch on. I put her in her crib, then went to lie down, thinking I was coming down with something. \nA few weeks later, I found out why I was feeling so terrible and the reason she didn\u2019t want to nurse anymore: I was pregnant with No. 3. It was a total surprise that had me both excited and worried \u2014 my first didn\u2019t take the arrival of his sister as well as I had hoped. In fact, he wanted nothing to do with her, and it bothered me. \nI felt like I was just getting the hang of having two kids, and with another one coming on the heels of her birth, I was prepared for his arrival to be a shock to her and her older brother. I would be spread even thinner \u2014 and I was, but something marvelous happened between my daughter and her younger brother that I didn\u2019t expect. They fell in love, immediately. \nThe look on her face when she first laid eyes on him in the hospital is something I remember like it was yesterday. Her lopsided pigtails stuck out straight as she wiggled to get out of her fathers\u2019 arms and join her brother and me in the hospital bed. At first I thought it was because she was feeling possessive and didn\u2019t want to share me, but I was wrong. She wanted her baby brother \u2014 to touch him, to kiss him, to look at him. She wanted to be as close to him as possible. \nThat was over 10 years ago, and that moment solidified a bond between the two of them that has never been broken. \nWhen you have two kids who are joined at the hip, their relationship goes beyond normal sibling love. They protect and take care of one another. They genuinely want to make each other happy, and many times, they think of their sibling before they think of themselves. \nTheir relationship is strong, which makes it easier for you as their parent. They can play or talk for hours. They start their own traditions, share all of their things, and calm each other down. I can\u2019t tell you how many times my daughter has been able to talk my son down when he is upset. Sometimes I try and fail, and she was an effect on him I just don\u2019t. It\u2019s like they have their own secret language. They understand each other in a way that no one else does. \nAnd when they fight (because they still fight), it is hard on both of them. Most of the time they make up quickly and don\u2019t hold grudges. They carry on as if nothing has happened. It has shown me what true forgiveness looks like. They don\u2019t have time to be angry because they are too busy enjoying each other\u2019s company. \nAt least once a week, this friendship they share brings tears of joy to my eyes. Just yesterday, my son gave his sister the last of his Cheetos. I could tell he really wanted them, but he knew she wanted them more (and didn\u2019t have her own).

I would see harried yoga-pants-clad moms driving their veritable clown cars around town, and I was amazed to see just how short their tempers were when in Target. I\u2019d stare openmouthed when I\u2019d see a mom lose her shit in the grocery store, and I was certain that if I was blessed with children, I\u2019d never, ever raise my voice \u2014 ever. \nBoy, did that thinking ever come back to bite me in the ass. Motherhood came along and not only caught me with my yoga pants down but also gave me a giant bitch slap right into reality. \nTurns out, a certain amount of yelling is required when raising kids . And I eat my words every single day when I\u2019m hissing at my kids to be quiet in church or using \u201casshole lips\u201d to get my point across when they are misbehaving in the grocery store. \nOh, how the mighty have fallen. \nYes, I\u2019m a mom who yells at my kids. But before you come at me with your pitchforks, I don\u2019t mean scream-yelling. I am not a mom who always raises her voice. Rather, I\u2019ve come to realize that there are many ways that I \u201cyell\u201d at my kids, and I suspect that you, too, yell at your kids using the same techniques. 1. Pursed Lips, aka \u201cAsshole Lips\u201d \nUsually accompanied with a stern \u201cGet. Over. Here.\u201d the pursed lips method of yelling at your children is usually best for those times when your kids are misbehaving in front of your in-laws, or those moments in libraries when your kids are disturbing the peace by running through the aisles like maniacs. And pursed lips are almost always the optimal choice for shutting your kids up in a movie theater. 2. Clenched Teeth, aka \u201cI. Said. NO.\u201d \nIf you troll the aisles of any Target or grocery store, you will inevitably see a mom with clenched teeth issuing a cease and desist order to her children. This form of yelling is reserved for those times when you are in public and you just cannot even with having to say no one. more. time. Clenched teeth are also used when the ice cream truck rolls down the street and when the kids beg for more tokens at Chuck. E. Cheese\u2019s. 3. The Single Eyebrow Raise, aka \u201cStop. Right. There.\u201d \nOf all the methods of mom yelling, I have perfected the art of the Single Eyebrow Raise. In fact, my kids stop in their tracks when they look at me from across a crowded playground and see my right eyebrow raised in a distinct arch. The Single Eyebrow Raise is best used when your kids behaving like assholes but out of earshot. Museums, community pools, and playgrounds are all places you will see moms executing the eyebrow raise of discipline. 4. The Unsettling Smile, aka \u201cThe Singsong Voice\u201d \nI don\u2019t know about you, but my brothers and I were masters at misbehaving at corporate functions, company picnics, or any place where my parents were trying to impress others. We always knew we were in for it when my mom would say in a sugar-sweet voice, \u201cYou need to stop that right now, sweetie. It\u2019s rude to stand on a chair that way.\u201d She\u2019d always say it with a creepy smile and wide eyes, and we knew that we\u2019d hear about it on the way home. 5. Complete and Total Rage, aka \u201cYour Neighbors Will Behave Too\u201d \nOkay, I admit, this style of mom yelling is the least acceptable, but we have all had those moments when motherhood has gotten the best of us. Whether it\u2019s discovering that your kids have cracked an entire carton of eggs on the floor or someone just flushed your favorite sweater down the toilet, we have all lost our mom shit Incredible Hulk style. And usually, it\u2019s when your windows are open. 6. Total Silence, aka \u201cShit Just Got Real\u201d \nAnd then there are those moments when yelling just won\u2019t do \u2014 those moments when you have to stop and take stock of the situation because you are speechless from rage. Moms of teenagers know this type of mom yelling well, because let\u2019s face it, teens can be total assholes. Total Silence isn\u2019t used often, but when you invoke this style of yelling, let\u2019s just say, the kids quake in their boots. \nI am not proud of losing my patience with my kids sometimes, but the fact is, sometimes a mom has to do what a mom has to do in order to get her kids to act right.", "crawled": "2017-04-01T06:11:42.130+03:00", "published": "2017-04-01T06:11:42.130+03:00", "uuid": "1b95e8c4fe67ba202a34f1785eeb54e17ab7b6bf", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 591, "likes": 591}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "scarymommy.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.scarymommy.com/feed/", "uuid": "1b95e8c4fe67ba202a34f1785eeb54e17ab7b6bf", "section_title": "Scary Mommy", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 5, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8C1Q610nHYYevCfzN9JDN6ZfMTuaKeX.XDt9QdkNaYuCl8VCBGXSQI", "domain_rank": 10926, "main_image": "http://www.scarymommy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/momyelling.jpg", "site_full": "www.scarymommy.com", "title_full": "The 6 Stages Of Mom Yelling (Sometimes It Doesn\u2019t Involve Sound)", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "The 6 Stages Of Mom Yelling (Sometimes It Doesn\u2019t Involve Sound)", "published": "2017-04-01T06:11:42.130+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "christine burke"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "i. said"}], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8C1Q610nHYYevCfzN9JDN6ZfMTuaKeX.XDt9QdkNaYuCl8VCBGXSQI", "author": "Christine Burke", "external_links": [], "title": "The 6 Stages Of Mom Yelling (Sometimes It Doesn\u2019t Involve Sound)", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Break Out the Blindfold \u2014 It'll Take These Sex Positions to the Next Level 4 hours ago Here's why you totally need a blindfold in your sexual arsenal Share Tumble Combined   \nEven though Fifty Shades of Grey was kind of a disappointing snooze-fest ( can you believe they actually made a second one ?), there was one happy outcome of the movie: It definitely brought BDSM a little more mainstream . Which is great, because it turns out that sex blindfolded might be the best thing that ever happened to humankind. \n\"Blindfolds are the number one bedroom prop for good reason,\" says Jessica O'Reilly, Ph.D., author of The New Sex Bible . \"The sensory deprivation you experience when you eliminate the sense of sight only heightens the perception of other senses, making every touch and every whisper all the more titillating. But blindfolds are also popular as a tool to reduce inhibitions and reduce performance pressure. By blindfolding your lover, you can let loose and forget about any self-consciousness that might interfere with pleasure.\" \nThere's another perk, too: \"Sex play that incorporates a blindfold can also help to shift the power differential in a relationship,\" says clinical sexologist and relationship therapist Kat Van Kirk . \"If the guy is the one to usually initiate, it can be a great way to allow her to take the reins and control the action.\" \nBelow are four sex positions that are even better with a blindfold. Start practicing your double knot now. 1. The Private Dancer Image: SheKnows Design \nHow you do it: Think of this position as the best, most straight-to-the-point lap dance ever. Ready? Now blindfold him. \"He sits on the edge of a couch and she stands in front of him [facing away from him],\" O'Reilly says. \"With her feet (preferably in heels) on the floor, she squats down over his entire length, allowing her body weight to rest in his lap for the ultimate in deep penetration. She leans into him on the upstroke for full-body contact, but bends forward on the downstroke to press his bulging head into her swollen G-spot. She can tug on the blindfold depending on how much she wants him to see.\" \nWhy it's especially awesome with a blindfold: \"This position gives her ultimate control of pace, rhythm and speed,\" O'Reilly says. \"By blindfolding her partner (partially or fully), she can comfortably ease herself into the exhibitionist role.\" 2. Rock 'n' Roll Image: SheKnows Design \nHow you do it: \n\"Both partners wear a blindfold for this move,\" O'Reilly says. \"He sits on the bed with his back against the headboard and his legs outstretched with a slight bend in the knee. She sits on his lap, facing him, with her legs on either side and her feet planted on the mattress next to his hips. He helps to pull her hips into him as she rocks against him.\" Why it's especially awesome with a blindfold: \n\"This position offers a balance of intimacy, as you're face to face in a vulnerable position, as well as unpredictability, as the blindfolds force you to feel your partner's rhythm in order to stay in sync,\" O'Reilly says. \"This is a minimal-movement position. You can use dirty whispers, pelvic squeezes and deep breathing to heighten the sensations.\" \nOriginally published November 2014.

Then, in late April 2016, an 87-page report by the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Cancer Assessment Review Committee (CARC) appeared on its website, claiming that the herbicide was \u201c not likely to be carcinogenic.\u201d It is interesting to note that the document was labeled \u201cfinal report,\u201d and was based on an assessment overseen by former EPA deputy director and chair of the CARC, Jess Rowland. \nThe report mysteriously vanished from the website on the 2 nd of May, with the explanation that it had been leaked, and was not, in fact, the agency\u2019s final word on the glyphosate issue. \nAnd that\u2019s where it gets really interesting, because just a few days later, Jess Rowland mysteriously retired. \nOf course, the usual \u201cnothing to see here\u201d rhetoric came thick and fast, with condescending references to \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d thrown in the direction of anyone who dared to question the glaring coincidence. \nThe latest twist in this saga is even more disturbing: A group of cancer victims who are suing Monsanto in a California federal court, have accused Rowland of actively hiding evidence of the cancer-causing properties of glyphosate. And their accusations are obviously not far-fetched, since the judge presiding over the trial has referred to the relationship between Monsanto and Jess Rowland as \u201chighly suspicious.\u201d \nThe plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys have introduced into evidence a letter written to Rowland in March 2013, by Senior Toxicologist Marion Copley. Copley worked in the EPA\u2019s Health Effects Division, had been with the agency for 30 years, and was the recipient of numerous awards. \nIn a sad and ironic twist, Copley herself was dying of cancer at the time she wrote the letter. \nCopley started the letter by referencing her decades of pathology experience and expressed the hope that her insights would be valuable to the CARC in its investigation of glyphosate. \nHaving noted that glyphosate was originally created as a chelating agent \u2013 chelators are chemicals or chemical compounds that react with heavy metals, altering their chemical structure and improving both their stability and their ability to bond with other metals or substances \u2013 Copley went on to list 14 different mechanisms in glyphosate that could cause cancer: \n\u2013 Chelators inhibit apoptosis, the process by which our bodies kill tumor cells \n-Chelators are endocrine disruptors, involved in tumorigenesis \n-Glyphosate induces lymphocyte proliferation \n-Glyphosate induces free radical formation \n-Chelators inhibit free radical scavenging enzymes requiring Zn, Mn or Cu for activity (i.e. SODs) \n-Chelators bind zinc, necessary for immune system function \n-Glyphosate is genotoxic, a key cancer mechanism \n-Chelators inhibit DNA repair enzymes requiring metal cofactors \n-Chelators bind Ca, Zn, Mg, etc to make foods deficient for these essential nutrients \n-Chelators bind calcium necessary for calcineurin-mediated immune response \n-Chelators often damage the kidneys or pancreas, as glyphosate does, a mechanism to tumor formation \n-Kidney/pancreas damage can lead to clinical chemistry changes to favor tumor growth \n-Glyphosate kills bacteria in the gut and the gastrointestinal system is 80% of the immune system \n-Chelators suppress the immune system making the body susceptible to tumors \nCopley then went on to make a truly shocking statement: She noted that while any one of the above mechanisms could, in fact, cause tumors, glyphosate causes all those mechanisms simultaneously. \nHer chilling conclusion? \u201cIt is essentially certain that glyphosate causes cancer .\u201d [Emphasis added] \nCopley went on to point out that Rowland\u2019s credentials were outdated, and that the CARC\u2019s science was at least a decade behind where it should have been. She begged him to put personal gain aside and do what he knew he needed to do in speaking out about the dangers of glyphosate. \nShe ended her letter, \u201cI have done my duty.\u201d \nJess Rowland, on the other hand, clearly did not do his duty. \nSources:", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:53:29.853+03:00", "published": "2017-03-31T17:25:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "956778d86a012bc6c17b95ac90198443e6e9987e", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 712, "likes": 712}, "gplus": {"shares": 18}, "vk": {"shares": 1}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}}, "country": "US", "site": "naturalnews.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.naturalnews.com/rss.xml", "uuid": "956778d86a012bc6c17b95ac90198443e6e9987e", "section_title": "NaturalNews.com", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 7, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_sejtWCbZc4MoE7EUHucFe2XkQogjQWfl44O.WmndRavtGu8R7b3b7daYO5HYbOJoNnGU31dwXW1vmNiKNJL5SU3fc6vM9J8yatMzL7O5pJ_L3FhCXm6rD2saDBFLoeq3flij3M8PxKwzHDUS1fdBz_oW4HomTsnGDcGgwzptbSAN7aw_HanK02K9yk519HlQvVTziVYUEUc4RQ75Gfs44b_eS_XAgnuPg2g5RhC_HEh43XYrLcuHh", "domain_rank": 6416, "main_image": "http://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2017/03/Glyphosate-e1490022139275.jpg", "site_full": "www.naturalnews.com", "title_full": "Shocking letter from dead EPA scientist reveals 14 biochemical mechanisms by which glyphosate (Roundup) causes cancer ...

To assess this, researchers at the University of Gothenberg examined 154 children who were either given the omega-3 fatty acid supplement Equazen or a placebo pill. Children in the Equazen group showed a 64 percent improvement in overall comprehension compared with the placebo group, the study revealed. Data also showed that children who took the fish oil supplement were five times faster in decoding jumbled up words than those who took the placebo pill. \nHowever, researchers found that the effects were replicated when the placebo group were given Equazen. \u201cWe were a bit surprised to see this level of effect in mainstream children. This has not been shown before. As a scientist, you always want a second study to confirm your findings, but these are very promising results,\u201d said study lead researcher Dr Mats Johnson . \n\u201cIt shows that Equazen is having a great effect on reading scores for mainstream children. A child who is a poor reader is likely to show behavioral problems and an inability to focus on learning tasks two years later. Similarly, children who show early signs of behavioral problems are more likely to develop reading problems,\u201d said public health nutritionist Dr. Emma Derbyshire . Fish oil boosts school performance in children \nThe recent findings coincide with various studies that previously examined the efficacy of fish oil supplements in improving the overall school performance in children . \nFish oil supplementation was associated with higher subject scores among students who took their annual standard assessment test, a 2007 study revealed. Research data showed that 92 percent of students met the required standard for English, a significant increase from a pre-estimated rate of only 68 percent. The study also showed that 92 percent of children met the national standards in maths, up from a pre-estimated passing rate of 78 percent. Marked improvements in concentration and behavior were also observed in children, researchers said. \nThe researchers also found that daily omega-3 supplementation lead to significant improvements in reading comprehension among younger students. Data showed that seven and eight-year-old pupils started with an average reading of nine months above their age, but finished with an average reading of 18 moths above their age at three months following fish oil supplementation. \nThe Durnham County Council in the U.K. also examined more than 3,000 grade 11 pupils and found that those who took Omega-3 and Omega-6 capsules had average scores that were 17.7 points higher than those in the control group. Fish oil improves cognitive function in babies \nData from a placebo-controlled study showed that fish oil supplementation during pregnancy helped improve visual acuity in babies. High fish intake was also associated with having significantly smarter infants, another study demonstrated. However, elevated levels of hair mercury seemed to dampen the beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids, researchers said. \nFish oils are packed with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which was shown to promote learning and visual acuity in infants. An analysis of 109 infants and their mothers demonstrated that higher cord blood levels of DHA resulted in better visual acuity, cognitive function, and motor development in babies during their first year. The results stress on the importance of increased essential fatty acid intake during the third trimester to promote photoreceptor development and synaptogenesis in the brain. (RELATED: Visit Brain.news for more coverage of nutrition for the brain.) \nIn a related study, children and women with high DHA levels in their blood cells exhibited above average scores in an intelligence test regardless of their fish oil intake. The results published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition suggest that long-term fatty acid intake may show greater efficacy in boosting cognitive performance than supplementation alone. \nSources:", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:53:29.621+03:00", "published": "2017-03-31T17:40:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "24d16ffd29f3d42667b6b2fe5420db76955ce648", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 500, "likes": 500}, "gplus": {"shares": 21}, "vk": {"shares": 1}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 22}}, "country": "US", "site": "naturalnews.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.naturalnews.com/rss.xml", "uuid": "24d16ffd29f3d42667b6b2fe5420db76955ce648", "section_title": "NaturalNews.com", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 5, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_sejtWCbZc4MoE7EUHucFe2XkQogjQWfllIkauzX5wwVVXjYYU53jpJAmyt24W_6OMrz05.YREsuK1t7l5Uz.UCAgsCrk359RcfLofox2kxCh6z1iJCQendRKqLnBVF4Ou01eDTxLP_g--", "domain_rank": 6416, "main_image": "http://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2016/12/Fotolia_71427182_XS.jpg", "site_full": "www.naturalnews.com", "title_full": "Fish oil found to significantly improve children's ability to read... shows power of nutrition to boost brain performance", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Fish oil found to significantly improve children's ability to read... shows power of nutrition to boost brain performance", "published": "2017-03-31T17:40:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "u.k."}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "mats johnson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "emma derbyshire"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "equazen"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "russel davis"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "durnham county council"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "american journal of clinical nutrition"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "university of gothenberg"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "equazen"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dha"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_sejtWCbZc4MoE7EUHucFe2XkQogjQWfllIkauzX5wwVVXjYYU53jpJAmyt24W_6OMrz05.YREsuK1t7l5Uz.UCAgsCrk359RcfLofox2kxCh6z1iJCQendRKqLnBVF4Ou01eDTxLP_g--", "author": "Russel Davis", "external_links": [], "title": "Fish oil found to significantly improve children's ability to read... shows power of nutrition to boost brain performance", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "North Korea could kill 90% of all Americans by dropping EMP nukes from orbiting satellites \nFriday, March 31, 2017 by: Russel Davis Tags: North Korea , nuclear weapons , nukes \n( Natural News ) North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un could easily wipe out 90 percent of the American population, two U.S. intelligence experts warned. \nIn a joint article, former CIA director Robert James Woolsey Jr and US Congressional EMP Task Force director Dr. Peter Vincent Pry refuted the mainstream media\u2019s allegations that North Korea may not be able deliver on its repeated threats to launch a nuclear strike against the U.S. \u201cFalse reassurance is given to the American people that North Korea has not \u2018demonstrated\u2019 that it can miniaturise a nuclear warhead small enough for missile delivery, or build a reentry vehicle for an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of penetrating the atmosphere to blast a US city,\u201d Woolsey and Pry stated . \nThe two experts noted that technological dilemmas such as warhead miniaturization and reentry vehicle design would be simple enough matters to address for countries that have already developed nuclear weapons and long-range missiles like North Korea. In a photograph that circulated last year, the North Korean dictator can be seen inspecting an alleged nuclear warhead that was purportedly small enough to be mounted on ballistic missiles. \nThe experts have also confirmed that North Korea indeed has two classes of intercontinental ballistic missile \u2014 the road mobile KN-08 and KN-14 \u2014 both of which seemed to be equipped with cutting-edge reentry vehicles. The experts also warned that North Korea could still land a huge blow in the U.S. defense even if their alleged nuclear weapons are yet to materialize. \nAccording to Woolsey and Pry, the country could easily deliver an atomic bomb concealed in a freighter going to the U.S., or hire terrorists to launch a nuclear suicide mission across the unguarded Mexican border, which may affect densely-populated port cities and areas closest to the border. The experts said detonating a Hiroshima-type A-bomb with a yield of 10-kilotons would result in about 200,000 casualties.The experts confirmed that North Korea has tested a nuclear weapon with estimated yields of 20 to 30 kilotons. According to the Defense Department, the country may have tested H-Bomb components in January last year. H-bombs are more powerful than A-bombs and may result in much larger casualties. Disturbing details on North Korea\u2019s alleged nukes \nCIA\u2019s top East Asia analyst publicly announced in 2008 that North Korea was successful in developing miniaturized nuclear warheads to be deployed on its Nodong medium-range missile. According to the analyst, the missile was able to strike Japan and South Korea, and may even reach the U.S. it delivered through a freighter. \nIn 2011, Lt. General Ronald Burgess, Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, testified that North Korea has already weaponized its nuclear devices into warheads. Burgess made his testimonies before the Senate Armed Services Committee. \nIn early 2015, former senior national security officials cautioned that North Korea might have the capacity to use satellites to launch a small nuclear warhead specifically developed to make a high-altitude electromagnetic pulse attack against the U.S. The Congressional EMP Commission warned that such an attack could potentially blackout the national electric grid and other infrastructures essential for sustaining life. This may result in subsequent societal collapse and starvation, which in turn may kill nine out of 10 Americans. \nTwo North Korean satellites \u2014 KMS-3 and KMS-4 \u2014 currently orbit over the U.S. These satellites\u2019 trajectories appear consistent with surprise EMP attack , Woolsey and Pry said. \nDuring a Pentagon press conference in April 2015, former North American Aerospace Defense commander Adm. William Gortney warned that North Korea\u2019s KN-08 mobile ICBM also has the capacity to launch a nuclear warhead against the U.S. Gortney repeated this warning in October 2015 during an Atlantic Council event. \u201cI agree with the intelligence community that we assess that they [North Koreans] have the ability, they have the weapons, and they have the ability to miniaturize those weapons, and they have the ability to put them on a rocket that can range the [U.S.] homeland,\u201d Gortney said . \nFollow more news about U.S. national security at NationalSecurity.news . \nSources:", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:53:21.392+03:00", "published": "2017-03-31T17:46:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "4b1972f92140656551a513e366b41e38942fbfee", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 993, "likes": 993}, "gplus": {"shares": 17}, "vk": {"shares": 1}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 6}}, "country": "US", "site": "naturalnews.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.naturalnews.com/rss.xml", "uuid": "4b1972f92140656551a513e366b41e38942fbfee", "section_title": "NaturalNews.com", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 9, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_sejtWCbZc4MoE7EUHucFe2XkQogjQWflFzQHWBjk.XGxZEUNlydSJQsvrHqEAoUTLv.4ic_kCRj6ICLBLFShNBoX1dIfexA93VHS6klfV3R2u7b.Pyub0Vo55VDGea8IA6nBkAd0yQ_cA_6s1_941vmaiMhJBI.PSnI2a9p6lAw--", "domain_rank": 6416, "main_image": "http://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2017/03/Kim-Jong-un.jpg", "site_full": "www.naturalnews.com", "title_full": "North Korea could kill 90% of all Americans by dropping EMP nukes from orbiting satellites", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "North Korea could kill 90% of all Americans by dropping EMP nukes from orbiting satellites", "published": "2017-03-31T17:46:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "north korea"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "us"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "u.s."}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "east asia"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "u.s"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "u.s. gortney"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "japan"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "south korea"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "woolsey"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "william gortney"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "peter vincent pry"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kim jong-un"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ronald burgess"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "robert james woolsey jr"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "gortney"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "burgess"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "russel davis"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "emp"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "nationalsecurity.news"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "pentagon"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "emp commission"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "defense intelligence agency"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "north american aerospace defense"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "senate armed services committee"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "atlantic council"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "us congressional emp task force"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cia"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "defense department"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_sejtWCbZc4MoE7EUHucFe2XkQogjQWflFzQHWBjk.XGxZEUNlydSJQsvrHqEAoUTLv.4ic_kCRj6ICLBLFShNBoX1dIfexA93VHS6klfV3R2u7b.Pyub0Vo55VDGea8IA6nBkAd0yQ_cA_6s1_941vmaiMhJBI.PSnI2a9p6lAw--", "author": "Russel Davis", "external_links": [], "title": "North Korea could kill 90% of all Americans by dropping EMP nukes from orbiting satellites", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Health Basics: What if you found out that most vaccines have never been shown to actually work? \nFriday, March 31, 2017 by: S.D.

When? \nMaybe today\u2019s medical science isn\u2019t all it\u2019s \u201ccracked up\u201d to be, and maybe, just maybe, everything you hear and read about in \u201cpeer reviewed\u201d journals is one huge lie repeated over and over again. Let\u2019s examine true science and you can be the final judge. Today\u2019s vaccines contain infected blood, cell and tissue samples from multiple wild animals, worms and aborted human babies \nSometimes the truth hurts, but what hurts much worse is when you or your children are injured by chemical-medical violence that\u2019s experimental, untested and unsafe, as admitted by the CDC themselves on their own website. Most people investigating their own health, their own medications, and the ingredients in their vaccinations want to see it printed on the product or on a reliable website. Here we go. \nThe Center for Disease Control and Prevention admits and publishes in plain view on their website that today\u2019s vaccines contain African Green Monkey kidney cells , human diploid fibroblast cell cultures from abortions, fetal bovine serum (blood from untested cows), modified Eagle\u2019s medium (yes, wild birds), chicken embryo, porcine circovirus (deadly wild pig virus), and Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cell protein (from untested dogs). \nWait, there\u2019s more! \nAs if it\u2019s not sick and twisted enough to inject pregnant women, newborns, babies, children, teens, young adults, parents, grandparents and the elderly with experimental blood and infected cells from all these animals, the CDC and FDA approve vaccine manufacturers using E. Coli, mixed-combined strains of live viruses, formaldehyde, monosodium glutamate (MSG), deadly mercury (listed as thimerosal \u2014 and yes, it\u2019s still in vaccines!), sodium chloride, aluminum (increases intensity of mercury), and get this\u2026 worm ovary cells from the fall armyworm, as used in the Flucelvax flu shot . Still want to inject some pig, dog, monkey, cow, worm and human blood, cells and tissue into your body for alleged \u201cimmunity\u201d that\u2019s never been proven to work? \nRealize this: Hardly a living soul reads the vaccine insert before getting vaccinated because they all trust their doctors and nurses and \u201cmodern American medicine.\u201d Big mistake. If you are highly allergic to peanuts, dairy, or other people\u2019s blood that\u2019s not your blood type, wouldn\u2019t it make sense to avoid injecting experimental ingredients from wild animals and insects? What about blood samples from abortions? Who even knows what was wrong with those babies? \nOn most vaccine inserts it reads, \u201cno controlled trials\u201d have been conducted that adequately demonstrate a decrease in disease after vaccination. Don\u2019t believe it? Check the vaccine sheet for Flulaval flu shot. The insert readily admits the vaccine has never been subjected to scientific clinical trials. Here\u2019s the quote: \n\u201cThere have been no controlled trials adequately demonstrating a decrease in influenza disease after vaccination with Flulaval.\u201d \nEthan Huff, a reporter for Natural News, stated it best recently: \n\u2026 in addition to all the viruses, heavy metals, chemical preservatives, food colorings, and other toxic ingredients used in making vaccines \u2026 children today are being injected with some of the most disturbing and poisonous substances known to mankind, and very few people seem at all concerned with what\u2019s going on. \nDon\u2019t miss the upcoming docu-series called The Truth About Vaccines , which features the Health Ranger and 60 other experts who reveal shocking truths about vaccine ingredients, medical science, immunology and more. \nIt\u2019s time to open your mind and learn something you might not know: \nSources:", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:53:03.183+03:00", "published": "2017-03-31T18:32:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "9815a6a6566c62d2873cbea196862f5840088b28", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 798, "likes": 798}, "gplus": {"shares": 19}, "vk": {"shares": 1}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}}, "country": "US", "site": "naturalnews.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.naturalnews.com/rss.xml", "uuid": "9815a6a6566c62d2873cbea196862f5840088b28", "section_title": "NaturalNews.com", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 7, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_sejtWCbZc4MoE7EUHucFe2XkQogjQWfk1baXIaxOTXoOJQFZBYLiOXx51fLeX8KelJg56jE9Sm_rvIUZ0D6I674SJjkK6.zI92.545AbdtlxtVSoDoUjKJKtN.7UmlDAqq.epHrlGuQ--", "domain_rank": 6416, "main_image": "http://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2017/01/vaccines.jpg", "site_full": "www.naturalnews.com", "title_full": "Health Basics: What if you found out that most vaccines have never been shown to actually work?", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Health Basics: What if you found out that most vaccines have never been shown to actually work?", "published": "2017-03-31T18:32:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [{"sentiment": "neutral", "name": "fri"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ethan huff"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "e. coli"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "eagle"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "natural news"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "fda"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "center for disease control and prevention"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cdc"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_sejtWCbZc4MoE7EUHucFe2XkQogjQWfk1baXIaxOTXoOJQFZBYLiOXx51fLeX8KelJg56jE9Sm_rvIUZ0D6I674SJjkK6.zI92.545AbdtlxtVSoDoUjKJKtN.7UmlDAqq.epHrlGuQ--", "author": "S.D.

Then, in late April 2016, an 87-page report by the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Cancer Assessment Review Committee (CARC) appeared on its website, claiming that the herbicide was \u201c not likely to be carcinogenic.\u201d It is interesting to note that the document was labeled \u201cfinal report,\u201d and was based on an assessment overseen by former EPA deputy director and chair of the CARC, Jess Rowland. \nThe report mysteriously vanished from the website on the 2 nd of May, with the explanation that it had been leaked, and was not, in fact, the agency\u2019s final word on the glyphosate issue. \nAnd that\u2019s where it gets really interesting, because just a few days later, Jess Rowland mysteriously retired. \nOf course, the usual \u201cnothing to see here\u201d rhetoric came thick and fast, with condescending references to \u201cconspiracy theories\u201d thrown in the direction of anyone who dared to question the glaring coincidence. \nThe latest twist in this saga is even more disturbing: A group of cancer victims who are suing Monsanto in a California federal court, have accused Rowland of actively hiding evidence of the cancer-causing properties of glyphosate. And their accusations are obviously not far-fetched, since the judge presiding over the trial has referred to the relationship between Monsanto and Jess Rowland as \u201chighly suspicious.\u201d \nThe plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys have introduced into evidence a letter written to Rowland in March 2013, by Senior Toxicologist Marion Copley. Copley worked in the EPA\u2019s Health Effects Division, had been with the agency for 30 years, and was the recipient of numerous awards. \nIn a sad and ironic twist, Copley herself was dying of cancer at the time she wrote the letter. \nCopley started the letter by referencing her decades of pathology experience and expressed the hope that her insights would be valuable to the CARC in its investigation of glyphosate. \nHaving noted that glyphosate was originally created as a chelating agent \u2013 chelators are chemicals or chemical compounds that react with heavy metals, altering their chemical structure and improving both their stability and their ability to bond with other metals or substances \u2013 Copley went on to list 14 different mechanisms in glyphosate that could cause cancer: \n\u2013 Chelators inhibit apoptosis, the process by which our bodies kill tumor cells \n-Chelators are endocrine disruptors, involved in tumorigenesis \n-Glyphosate induces lymphocyte proliferation \n-Glyphosate induces free radical formation \n-Chelators inhibit free radical scavenging enzymes requiring Zn, Mn or Cu for activity (i.e. SODs) \n-Chelators bind zinc, necessary for immune system function \n-Glyphosate is genotoxic, a key cancer mechanism \n-Chelators inhibit DNA repair enzymes requiring metal cofactors \n-Chelators bind Ca, Zn, Mg, etc to make foods deficient for these essential nutrients \n-Chelators bind calcium necessary for calcineurin-mediated immune response \n-Chelators often damage the kidneys or pancreas, as glyphosate does, a mechanism to tumor formation \n-Kidney/pancreas damage can lead to clinical chemistry changes to favor tumor growth \n-Glyphosate kills bacteria in the gut and the gastrointestinal system is 80% of the immune system \n-Chelators suppress the immune system making the body susceptible to tumors \nCopley then went on to make a truly shocking statement: She noted that while any one of the above mechanisms could, in fact, cause tumors, glyphosate causes all those mechanisms simultaneously. \nHer chilling conclusion? \u201cIt is essentially certain that glyphosate causes cancer .\u201d [Emphasis added] \nCopley went on to point out that Rowland\u2019s credentials were outdated, and that the CARC\u2019s science was at least a decade behind where it should have been. She begged him to put personal gain aside and do what he knew he needed to do in speaking out about the dangers of glyphosate. \nShe ended her letter, \u201cI have done my duty.\u201d \nJess Rowland, on the other hand, clearly did not do his duty. \nSources:", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:44:53.670+03:00", "published": "2017-03-31T17:25:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "b2dc6e92d899827d6646401903b003cf806446e4", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 712, "likes": 712}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}}, "country": "US", "site": "naturalnews.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://naturalnews.com/rss.xml", "uuid": "b2dc6e92d899827d6646401903b003cf806446e4", "section_title": "NaturalNews.com", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 7, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXUmbhBqaECsm7h5AXk2lXXMcm9NcC8qWh7nEwkCWAL2KYPcpOTMAkHkm2A4tSQHGLz8A.EyyHKR9D5gdpMuX4CK7fRP6YSEdb3JOgQR_LNikTu.6GHSedaYYU_QhlYrVST04Lhk1bVSIr_mqq_5kxjxJk0mPVFmc5PhSAhyntwfhtq9k4NLSeVoGxbIlXQydLB25dkv2oTAdmy4E0h23ItZyh46XcNSUoa.uW9ATuxLcOjUl3lb_j_", "domain_rank": 6416, "main_image": "http://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2017/03/Glyphosate-e1490022139275.jpg", "site_full": "naturalnews.com", "title_full": "Shocking letter from dead EPA scientist reveals 14 biochemical mechanisms by which glyphosate (Roundup) causes cancer ...

To assess this, researchers at the University of Gothenberg examined 154 children who were either given the omega-3 fatty acid supplement Equazen or a placebo pill. Children in the Equazen group showed a 64 percent improvement in overall comprehension compared with the placebo group, the study revealed. Data also showed that children who took the fish oil supplement were five times faster in decoding jumbled up words than those who took the placebo pill. \nHowever, researchers found that the effects were replicated when the placebo group were given Equazen. \u201cWe were a bit surprised to see this level of effect in mainstream children. This has not been shown before. As a scientist, you always want a second study to confirm your findings, but these are very promising results,\u201d said study lead researcher Dr Mats Johnson . \n\u201cIt shows that Equazen is having a great effect on reading scores for mainstream children. A child who is a poor reader is likely to show behavioral problems and an inability to focus on learning tasks two years later. Similarly, children who show early signs of behavioral problems are more likely to develop reading problems,\u201d said public health nutritionist Dr. Emma Derbyshire . Fish oil boosts school performance in children \nThe recent findings coincide with various studies that previously examined the efficacy of fish oil supplements in improving the overall school performance in children . \nFish oil supplementation was associated with higher subject scores among students who took their annual standard assessment test, a 2007 study revealed. Research data showed that 92 percent of students met the required standard for English, a significant increase from a pre-estimated rate of only 68 percent. The study also showed that 92 percent of children met the national standards in maths, up from a pre-estimated passing rate of 78 percent. Marked improvements in concentration and behavior were also observed in children, researchers said. \nThe researchers also found that daily omega-3 supplementation lead to significant improvements in reading comprehension among younger students. Data showed that seven and eight-year-old pupils started with an average reading of nine months above their age, but finished with an average reading of 18 moths above their age at three months following fish oil supplementation. \nThe Durnham County Council in the U.K. also examined more than 3,000 grade 11 pupils and found that those who took Omega-3 and Omega-6 capsules had average scores that were 17.7 points higher than those in the control group. Fish oil improves cognitive function in babies \nData from a placebo-controlled study showed that fish oil supplementation during pregnancy helped improve visual acuity in babies. High fish intake was also associated with having significantly smarter infants, another study demonstrated. However, elevated levels of hair mercury seemed to dampen the beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acids, researchers said. \nFish oils are packed with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which was shown to promote learning and visual acuity in infants. An analysis of 109 infants and their mothers demonstrated that higher cord blood levels of DHA resulted in better visual acuity, cognitive function, and motor development in babies during their first year. The results stress on the importance of increased essential fatty acid intake during the third trimester to promote photoreceptor development and synaptogenesis in the brain. (RELATED: Visit Brain.news for more coverage of nutrition for the brain.) \nIn a related study, children and women with high DHA levels in their blood cells exhibited above average scores in an intelligence test regardless of their fish oil intake. The results published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition suggest that long-term fatty acid intake may show greater efficacy in boosting cognitive performance than supplementation alone. \nSources:", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:44:53.330+03:00", "published": "2017-03-31T17:40:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "355c9c22cc775dbd8a9fc893ae1712c36275cf63", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 500, "likes": 500}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 22}}, "country": "US", "site": "naturalnews.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://naturalnews.com/rss.xml", "uuid": "355c9c22cc775dbd8a9fc893ae1712c36275cf63", "section_title": "NaturalNews.com", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 5, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXUmbhBqaECsm7h5AXk2lXXMcm9NcC8qWjjfYgLNdo41jxuo9aeiIIewPFzkLyhfM7y.RuAEuz5K1Jogf.ap4ORGig5x.2i0O223MGcQXGZSXOgfXFChOOrGJpQX6GvdYDLH6CzowJBGg--", "domain_rank": 6416, "main_image": "http://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2016/12/Fotolia_71427182_XS.jpg", "site_full": "naturalnews.com", "title_full": "Fish oil found to significantly improve children's ability to read... shows power of nutrition to boost brain performance", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Fish oil found to significantly improve children's ability to read... shows power of nutrition to boost brain performance", "published": "2017-03-31T17:40:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "u.k."}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "mats johnson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "emma derbyshire"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "equazen"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "russel davis"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "durnham county council"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "american journal of clinical nutrition"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "university of gothenberg"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "equazen"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dha"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXUmbhBqaECsm7h5AXk2lXXMcm9NcC8qWjjfYgLNdo41jxuo9aeiIIewPFzkLyhfM7y.RuAEuz5K1Jogf.ap4ORGig5x.2i0O223MGcQXGZSXOgfXFChOOrGJpQX6GvdYDLH6CzowJBGg--", "author": "Russel Davis", "external_links": [], "title": "Fish oil found to significantly improve children's ability to read... shows power of nutrition to boost brain performance", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "North Korea could kill 90% of all Americans by dropping EMP nukes from orbiting satellites \nFriday, March 31, 2017 by: Russel Davis Tags: North Korea , nuclear weapons , nukes \n( Natural News ) North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong-un could easily wipe out 90 percent of the American population, two U.S. intelligence experts warned. \nIn a joint article, former CIA director Robert James Woolsey Jr and US Congressional EMP Task Force director Dr. Peter Vincent Pry refuted the mainstream media\u2019s allegations that North Korea may not be able deliver on its repeated threats to launch a nuclear strike against the U.S. \u201cFalse reassurance is given to the American people that North Korea has not \u2018demonstrated\u2019 that it can miniaturise a nuclear warhead small enough for missile delivery, or build a reentry vehicle for an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of penetrating the atmosphere to blast a US city,\u201d Woolsey and Pry stated . \nThe two experts noted that technological dilemmas such as warhead miniaturization and reentry vehicle design would be simple enough matters to address for countries that have already developed nuclear weapons and long-range missiles like North Korea. In a photograph that circulated last year, the North Korean dictator can be seen inspecting an alleged nuclear warhead that was purportedly small enough to be mounted on ballistic missiles. \nThe experts have also confirmed that North Korea indeed has two classes of intercontinental ballistic missile \u2014 the road mobile KN-08 and KN-14 \u2014 both of which seemed to be equipped with cutting-edge reentry vehicles. The experts also warned that North Korea could still land a huge blow in the U.S. defense even if their alleged nuclear weapons are yet to materialize. \nAccording to Woolsey and Pry, the country could easily deliver an atomic bomb concealed in a freighter going to the U.S., or hire terrorists to launch a nuclear suicide mission across the unguarded Mexican border, which may affect densely-populated port cities and areas closest to the border. The experts said detonating a Hiroshima-type A-bomb with a yield of 10-kilotons would result in about 200,000 casualties.The experts confirmed that North Korea has tested a nuclear weapon with estimated yields of 20 to 30 kilotons. According to the Defense Department, the country may have tested H-Bomb components in January last year. H-bombs are more powerful than A-bombs and may result in much larger casualties. Disturbing details on North Korea\u2019s alleged nukes \nCIA\u2019s top East Asia analyst publicly announced in 2008 that North Korea was successful in developing miniaturized nuclear warheads to be deployed on its Nodong medium-range missile. According to the analyst, the missile was able to strike Japan and South Korea, and may even reach the U.S. it delivered through a freighter. \nIn 2011, Lt. General Ronald Burgess, Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, testified that North Korea has already weaponized its nuclear devices into warheads. Burgess made his testimonies before the Senate Armed Services Committee. \nIn early 2015, former senior national security officials cautioned that North Korea might have the capacity to use satellites to launch a small nuclear warhead specifically developed to make a high-altitude electromagnetic pulse attack against the U.S. The Congressional EMP Commission warned that such an attack could potentially blackout the national electric grid and other infrastructures essential for sustaining life. This may result in subsequent societal collapse and starvation, which in turn may kill nine out of 10 Americans. \nTwo North Korean satellites \u2014 KMS-3 and KMS-4 \u2014 currently orbit over the U.S. These satellites\u2019 trajectories appear consistent with surprise EMP attack , Woolsey and Pry said. \nDuring a Pentagon press conference in April 2015, former North American Aerospace Defense commander Adm. William Gortney warned that North Korea\u2019s KN-08 mobile ICBM also has the capacity to launch a nuclear warhead against the U.S. Gortney repeated this warning in October 2015 during an Atlantic Council event. \u201cI agree with the intelligence community that we assess that they [North Koreans] have the ability, they have the weapons, and they have the ability to miniaturize those weapons, and they have the ability to put them on a rocket that can range the [U.S.] homeland,\u201d Gortney said . \nFollow more news about U.S. national security at NationalSecurity.news . \nSources:", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:44:53.186+03:00", "published": "2017-03-31T17:46:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "37398dad721fe5726f4cee92d6dd7fe886bab305", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 993, "likes": 993}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 1}, "linkedin": {"shares": 6}}, "country": "US", "site": "naturalnews.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://naturalnews.com/rss.xml", "uuid": "37398dad721fe5726f4cee92d6dd7fe886bab305", "section_title": "NaturalNews.com", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 9, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXUmbhBqaECsm7h5AXk2lXXMcm9NcC8qWhK7wmKr8V0rSJapaZ5Yqc_IKEcPpNTUyhWrS76dI6nwL6wBUr.RoRzO12zVfZyeHP6iCAWpLaEdsWu0Na0OUsNv.mi126A0jlADjmdu5QMlPe9A5W0AXuqKK32HNZAU3at2NM5bxz9fA--", "domain_rank": 6416, "main_image": "http://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2017/03/Kim-Jong-un.jpg", "site_full": "naturalnews.com", "title_full": "North Korea could kill 90% of all Americans by dropping EMP nukes from orbiting satellites", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "North Korea could kill 90% of all Americans by dropping EMP nukes from orbiting satellites", "published": "2017-03-31T17:46:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "north korea"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "us"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "u.s."}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "east asia"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "u.s"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "u.s. gortney"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "japan"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "south korea"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "woolsey"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "william gortney"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "peter vincent pry"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kim jong-un"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ronald burgess"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "robert james woolsey jr"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "gortney"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "burgess"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "russel davis"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "emp"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "nationalsecurity.news"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "pentagon"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "emp commission"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "defense intelligence agency"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "north american aerospace defense"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "senate armed services committee"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "atlantic council"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "us congressional emp task force"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cia"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "defense department"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXUmbhBqaECsm7h5AXk2lXXMcm9NcC8qWhK7wmKr8V0rSJapaZ5Yqc_IKEcPpNTUyhWrS76dI6nwL6wBUr.RoRzO12zVfZyeHP6iCAWpLaEdsWu0Na0OUsNv.mi126A0jlADjmdu5QMlPe9A5W0AXuqKK32HNZAU3at2NM5bxz9fA--", "author": "Russel Davis", "external_links": [], "title": "North Korea could kill 90% of all Americans by dropping EMP nukes from orbiting satellites", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Health Basics: What if you found out that most vaccines have never been shown to actually work? \nFriday, March 31, 2017 by: S.D.

To question something as \u201cmonumental\u201d and \u201cprolific\u201d as inoculations requires courage, intelligence and the ability to accept the truth \u2013 whether you like the answer that you get or not. Can you accept it? Would you? When? \nMaybe today\u2019s medical science isn\u2019t all it\u2019s \u201ccracked up\u201d to be, and maybe, just maybe, everything you hear and read about in \u201cpeer reviewed\u201d journals is one huge lie repeated over and over again. Let\u2019s examine true science and you can be the final judge. Today\u2019s vaccines contain infected blood, cell and tissue samples from multiple wild animals, worms and aborted human babies \nSometimes the truth hurts, but what hurts much worse is when you or your children are injured by chemical-medical violence that\u2019s experimental, untested and unsafe, as admitted by the CDC themselves on their own website. Most people investigating their own health, their own medications, and the ingredients in their vaccinations want to see it printed on the product or on a reliable website. Here we go. \nThe Center for Disease Control and Prevention admits and publishes in plain view on their website that today\u2019s vaccines contain African Green Monkey kidney cells , human diploid fibroblast cell cultures from abortions, fetal bovine serum (blood from untested cows), modified Eagle\u2019s medium (yes, wild birds), chicken embryo, porcine circovirus (deadly wild pig virus), and Madin-Darby Canine Kidney cell protein (from untested dogs). \nWait, there\u2019s more! \nAs if it\u2019s not sick and twisted enough to inject pregnant women, newborns, babies, children, teens, young adults, parents, grandparents and the elderly with experimental blood and infected cells from all these animals, the CDC and FDA approve vaccine manufacturers using E. Coli, mixed-combined strains of live viruses, formaldehyde, monosodium glutamate (MSG), deadly mercury (listed as thimerosal \u2014 and yes, it\u2019s still in vaccines!), sodium chloride, aluminum (increases intensity of mercury), and get this\u2026 worm ovary cells from the fall armyworm, as used in the Flucelvax flu shot . Still want to inject some pig, dog, monkey, cow, worm and human blood, cells and tissue into your body for alleged \u201cimmunity\u201d that\u2019s never been proven to work? \nRealize this: Hardly a living soul reads the vaccine insert before getting vaccinated because they all trust their doctors and nurses and \u201cmodern American medicine.\u201d Big mistake. If you are highly allergic to peanuts, dairy, or other people\u2019s blood that\u2019s not your blood type, wouldn\u2019t it make sense to avoid injecting experimental ingredients from wild animals and insects? What about blood samples from abortions? Who even knows what was wrong with those babies? \nOn most vaccine inserts it reads, \u201cno controlled trials\u201d have been conducted that adequately demonstrate a decrease in disease after vaccination. Don\u2019t believe it? Check the vaccine sheet for Flulaval flu shot. The insert readily admits the vaccine has never been subjected to scientific clinical trials. Here\u2019s the quote: \n\u201cThere have been no controlled trials adequately demonstrating a decrease in influenza disease after vaccination with Flulaval.\u201d \nEthan Huff, a reporter for Natural News, stated it best recently: \n\u2026 in addition to all the viruses, heavy metals, chemical preservatives, food colorings, and other toxic ingredients used in making vaccines \u2026 children today are being injected with some of the most disturbing and poisonous substances known to mankind, and very few people seem at all concerned with what\u2019s going on. \nDon\u2019t miss the upcoming docu-series called The Truth About Vaccines , which features the Health Ranger and 60 other experts who reveal shocking truths about vaccine ingredients, medical science, immunology and more. \nIt\u2019s time to open your mind and learn something you might not know: \nSources:", "crawled": "2017-03-31T20:44:50.424+03:00", "published": "2017-03-31T18:32:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "cd4e920d775a7334f7cd5642c8d074d947475669", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 798, "likes": 798}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}}, "country": "US", "site": "naturalnews.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://naturalnews.com/rss.xml", "uuid": "cd4e920d775a7334f7cd5642c8d074d947475669", "section_title": "NaturalNews.com", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 7, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXUmbhBqaECsm7h5AXk2lXXMcm9NcC8qWj8BUkC_m736rSOpcckaA1nuV.fcTTtjMQZHaQp1.xBcGq675BzhZy_Vec5NViaf2kRex4GJC9OZJ..g4Op_79HU5SVOo2_3_g-", "domain_rank": 6416, "main_image": "http://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2017/01/vaccines.jpg", "site_full": "naturalnews.com", "title_full": "Health Basics: What if you found out that most vaccines have never been shown to actually work?", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Health Basics: What if you found out that most vaccines have never been shown to actually work?", "published": "2017-03-31T18:32:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [{"sentiment": "neutral", "name": "fri"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ethan huff"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "e. coli"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "eagle"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "natural news"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "fda"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "center for disease control and prevention"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cdc"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXUmbhBqaECsm7h5AXk2lXXMcm9NcC8qWj8BUkC_m736rSOpcckaA1nuV.fcTTtjMQZHaQp1.xBcGq675BzhZy_Vec5NViaf2kRex4GJC9OZJ..g4Op_79HU5SVOo2_3_g-", "author": "S.D.

(Getty Images) \nYou may wind up in a neurologist's office if your primary care doctor suspects that you have multiple sclerosis . Maybe your symptoms led you there, or maybe it was the result of a magnetic resonance imaging brain scan. But that doesn't mean you actually have MS, the progressive autoimmune disease that damages the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. \nMany people are sent to specialists when symptoms appear to indicate multiple sclerosis. \"Patients come in and think they have MS, but often it turns out to be another problem,\" says Dr. Dean Sutherland , a neurologist and clinical assistant professor at the Florida State University College of Medicine. \"That's because there are so many conditions that look like MS.\" \n[See: 5 Rare Diseases You've Never Heard of (Until Now) .] \nOverlapping Symptoms \nMS often causes temporary attacks of weakness, blindness and sensory changes that happen over the course of a couple days. The National Multiple Sclerosis Society reports that common symptoms include fatigue, trouble walking, numbness and tingling, involuntary muscle spasms, weakness, vision problems, dizziness and vertigo, bladder and bowel problems, sexual dysfunction, pain, changes in thinking skills and depression. Less common symptoms include headache, hearing loss, itching, seizures, tremors and speech and swallowing problems. Who Are the Kinds of People Who Get MS? Data show women and smokers are more at risk, but other connections need more research. \nVarious combinations of those symptoms can be present in many other disorders. For example: \"The most common symptom of MS is fatigue. But there are dozens [of] other conditions that also cause fatigue,\" says Dr. Barbara Giesser , professor of clinical neurology and clinical director of the Multiple Sclerosis Program at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. \nOther conditions may also mimic MS in diagnostic testing. For example, many disorders show up as spots on a brain MRI, just like MS. \nThe National Multiple Sclerosis Society lists two dozen common and rare conditions that should be ruled out before making a diagnosis of MS. These include: \nVitamin deficiency , such as B12, which is crucial for red blood cell formation and neurological function. \"Too little B12 can cause the brain to look similar to multiple sclerosis. The white brain matter changes,\" says Sutherland. Symptoms of B12 deficiency similar to MS include fatigue, difficulty maintaining balance, depression and numbness and tingling in the hands and feet. \nLyme disease , a bacterial infection transmitted by ticks. \"It can cause spots on an MRI or spinal fluid abnormalities,\" Giesser says. Symptoms similar to MS include fatigue, weakness and muscle aches. \nHuman immunodeficiency virus, or HIV , which attacks the body's immune system. Similar symptoms to MS include weakness, spinal cord problems, fatigue, and spots on an MRI. \nAutoimmune conditions such as lupus , which attacks the organs, skin and nervous system; Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, which attacks the joints, nervous system and moisture glands; and sarcoidosis, which attacks the lungs, skin, lymph nodes, liver and nervous system. All of these disorders can present with debilitating fatigue and specific neurological symptoms, such as weakness, visual problems or sensory changes (such as numbness, tingling, prickling or burning sensations). \"These conditions can cause nerve damage in the same areas as MS, and give similar symptoms and findings, but the way the nerve damage is produced is different than in MS,\" Giesser says. \nCADASIL (aka Cerebral Autosomal-Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy), an inherited disease caused by a gene mutation that affects small blood vessels in the brain. \"I've seen this cause neurological symptoms similar to MS, such as migraine headaches, seizures, vision problems and depression,\" Sutherland says. \nBrain tumors, which can cause many symptoms similar to MS, including headaches; vision, hearing or speech problems; difficulty with balance; and seizures . Disproven Theories About the Causes of MS and Its Flare-ups Science may get closer to actual causes when it learns what doesn't trigger the disease. \nSpine conditions, such as cervical stenosis, a narrowing of the space around the nerves or spinal cord; or a herniated disk , when part of the soft disk material leaks out, irritates the nerves or presses against the spinal cord, and causes neurological symptoms. \"Anything that affects the spinal cord can cause weakness and affect bladder, bowel or sexual function,\"Giesser says. \n[See: 16 Health Screenings All Women Need .] \nMaking the Distinction \nWith so many overlapping symptoms, how do doctors narrow down the possibilities and figure out what's causing them? \nIt starts with a visit to a neurologist that includes a physical exam and a look at your medical history . Your doctor may order several tests including: An MRI of the brain and spinal cord. A spinal tap to check the fluid around your brain and spinal cord. An evoked potential, or EP, exam to measure electrical activity in the brain and electrical signals along the nerves. \nSince MS isn't the only thing that can cause abnormalities on these tests, it's up to your doctor to then pinpoint the cause of your symptoms. \"For example, I often see a patient with spots on an MRI. So I'll look at the size and shape and distribution of the spots to see if they're more suggestive of MS or more indicative of another condition,\" Giesser explains. \nOr your doctor will look at the pattern of MS symptoms. \"MS can cause attacks of weakness, blindness or sensory changes that happen over the course of a couple days, and then get better. Other conditions, like B12 deficiency , take a long time to cause damage, and don't cause acute attacks like MS,\" Sutherland says. \"Ruling out other causes is what helps us figure it out.\" \nDon't Jump to Conclusions \nIf you feel you have symptoms of MS, or if your primary care doctor suggests that you do, try to reserve judgment until you can talk to a neurologist . The actual diagnosis may be something else. \n[See: 10 Lessons From Empowered Patients .] \nSutherland has a long list of examples of patients he's seen whose initial MS diagnosis from a primary care doctor was wrong. There was the young woman who'd been backpacking along the northeastern Appalachian Trail, and came home and developed severe fatigue and weakness in her arm. \"She really had acute Lyme disease. She was treated and is now a triathlete,\" Sutherland says. And there was the 52-year-old man struggling with cognitive (thinking skills) changes and migraine headaches. He'd been told he had MS after a suspicious MRI. \"He actually had a rare type of migraine-like condition that ran in the family,\" Sutherland says. \n\"We don't have one slam-dunk test for MS,\" Giesser adds. \"We have to meet criteria for evidence of nerve damage in more than one place in the central nervous system, which occurs at more than one point in time, and make sure there's no other condition that could have produced similar symptoms. It's not MS until we satisfy these rules.\" 9 Foods That Can Keep Your Brain Sharp Slideshow Food for thought (iStockPhoto) \nWhat you eat isn\u2019t just about keeping your waistline small \u2013 it\u2019s about keeping your brain healthy as well. The foods you eat, especially foods high in antioxidants, can help ward off dementia and improve your brain health . As Stony Brook University registered dietitian Stephanie May tells students, choosing colorful fruits and vegetables \u2013 and avoiding processed foods \u2013 will fuel you for success. Get started with these nine options: Blueberries (iStockPhoto) \nA superfood rich in antioxidants, blueberries reduce oxidative stress on the brain and have been shown to improve learning capacity and motor skills. \u201cPhytochemicals give fruits and vegetables their color,\u201d says Kristin Kirkpatrick, an Eat + Run blogger and manager of wellness nutrition services at Cleveland Clinic\u2019s Wellness Institute. \u201cFoods high in these chemicals have the most effective means of improving your health, and blueberries have one of the strongest concentrations available.\u201d Citrus fruits (iStockPhoto) \nPucker up! Lemons, limes, oranges and grapefruits can all help your brain stay healthy, Kirkpatrick says. Whether you're including it in a salad dressing, sipping on lemonade or squirting it on tacos, get some citrus in your daily diet. \u201cStudies show that people who have citrus fruits every day are able to prevent cognitive decline by more than two years,\u201d she says. Nuts (iStockPhoto) \nAlmonds are high in vitamin E, monounsaturated fats and other vitamins and minerals, making them a snacking no-brainer \u2013 particularly when it comes to preventing cognitive decline and preserving memory. Walnuts are a powerful brain food, too, thanks to their high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Including them in your diet can improve brain cell communication and growth, according to a 2014 study in The Journal of Nutrition. May encourages students to enjoy nuts in homemade trail mix by combining 1/4 cup of nuts, 1/4 cup of whole-grain cereal and 2 tablespoons of dried fruit. Snacking on pistachios is a good choice, too. Fish (iStockPhoto) \nSalmon is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which helps prevent cognitive decline, but it\u2019s far from the only fish high in these beneficial fats. Sardines, anchovies and lake trout are all great sources of omega-3 fatty acids, meaning you can hit your quota of eating fish twice per week without getting bored of eating the same thing. \u201cOmega-3 fatty acids are anti-inflammatory, so they reduce inflammation in the body,\u201d says Marilyn Gordon, a registered dietitian with Nova Southeastern University in Florida. \u201cThey are good for cardiovascular health and have been shown to preserve brain function.\u201d Avocados (iStockPhoto) \nYes, avocados are high in fat \u2013 but it\u2019s a good fat that helps our brains function, Gordon says. The monounsaturated fat in avocados helps prevent high blood pressure , which is a risk factor for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. They're also a good source of lutein, a carotenoid related to better cognition. One 2015 study even found that people who ate one avocado every day for six months improved in several cognitive functions compared to people who ate a daily serving of chickpeas or a potato . Avocados are high in calories, however, so watch how much you eat. Coffee (iStockPhoto) \nYour morning cup might do more than just help get your day started, Kirkpatrick says. \u201cCoffee is high in antioxidants, which surprises people,\u201d she says. \u201cStudies have shown that regular coffee drinkers have a decreased risk of dementia.\u201d Just don't pile on the calories by adding loads of cream and sugar . Greek yogurt (iStockPhoto) \nInstead of reaching for that pint of ice cream when stress strikes, try Greek yogurt topped with fresh fruit and a handful of granola or another cereal made with whole grains, May suggests. The vitamins and minerals in Greek yogurt can help relieve stress and give your body and brain energy. What's more, research suggests probiotics (like those found in many yogurts) can help prevent cognitive decline and age-related memory loss, Kirkpatrick points out. Eggs (Getty Images) \nStop ordering egg whites and embrace the bright, round yolks , May says. \"When you eat eggs, your brain uses these vitamins to support memory and increase communication among brain cells,\" she says. Try them hard-boiled as a portable snack along with sliced veggies and hummus, or in an omelet made with spinach, tomatoes and onion, May recommends. Whole grains (iStockPhoto) \nSay hello to oatmeal, barley and quinoa \u2013 all great complex carbohydrates that help fuel the brain, May says. \"Oats contain soluble fiber, which removes cholesterol from the body and prevents plaque from forming in the arteries,\" she says. \"Clear arteries help ensure blood flows well and may help reduce the risk of developing stroke and dementia.\" Whole grains are also a staple in the Mediterranean diet \u2013 an eating style shown to improve cognition when compared with a low-fat diet.", "crawled": "2017-03-31T18:49:52.134+03:00", "published": "2017-03-31T18:49:52.134+03:00", "uuid": "ea2b4fa8e6847d4bba1fa3a7a296469743edbf43", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 941, "likes": 941}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "usnews.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.usnews.com/rss/usnews.rss", "uuid": "ea2b4fa8e6847d4bba1fa3a7a296469743edbf43", "section_title": "U.S. News", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 9, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWZG21x8JaDW3nvuHjU7RP_U_xEUGCOMeBMhqPe2Stmr3ttc5WGeRUaGBgJ37yg6EArHAfmhqNJLT01vwCfVr9ZE17.4X8UBMiWxM.xbn4KTdYeXomcSokspYhjSlS1mCdfqBZKGwGmXEw--", "domain_rank": 1027, "main_image": "https://www.usnews.com/cmsmedia/6e/8f/9a28cbe44b0f82377f7e78e167a9/150714-tabletdoctor-stock.jpg", "site_full": "health.usnews.com", "title_full": "Before an MS Diagnosis, Rule Out These Conditions First", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Before an MS Diagnosis, Rule Out These Conditions First", "published": "2017-03-31T18:49:52.134+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "mediterranean"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "florida"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "appalachian trail"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "dean sutherland"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "gordon"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "stephanie may"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "sj\u00f6gren"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "sutherland"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "marilyn gordon"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kirkpatrick"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "barbara giesser"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "giesser"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kristin kirkpatrick"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "nova southeastern university"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "salmon"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cleveland clinic\u2019s wellness institute"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ucla"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "florida state university college of medicine"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "national multiple sclerosis society"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "stony brook university"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "getty images"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "david geffen school of medicine"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/uBQNNiLKiWZG21x8JaDW3nvuHjU7RP_U_xEUGCOMeBMhqPe2Stmr3ttc5WGeRUaGBgJ37yg6EArHAfmhqNJLT01vwCfVr9ZE17.4X8UBMiWxM.xbn4KTdYeXomcSokspYhjSlS1mCdfqBZKGwGmXEw--", "author": "Heidi Godman", "external_links": [], "title": "Before an MS Diagnosis, Rule Out These Conditions First", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Trump meets with victims of opioid addiction: this is a total \u201cepidemic\u201d \nThursday, March 30, 2017 by: News Editors \n( Natural News ) President Donald Trump met on Wednesday with victims of opioid addiction and members of his committee who will address the growing crisis. \n(Article by Charlie Spiering from breitbart.com ) \n\u201cOpioid abuse has become a crippling problem throughout the United States,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is a total epidemic.
