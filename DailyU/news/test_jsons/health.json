It\u2019s the time of year when sleepless nights and anxiety-filled days all lead up to one 30- to 45-minute meeting that will determine the course of the next full year of your child\u2019s school career. That time when you sit alone at a table of teachers, therapists, and psychologists who all think they know your child\u2019s needs better than you do, while you fight to prove otherwise. A time when you struggle to maintain your composure while simultaneously jumping through hoops to make sure your child\u2019s educational requirements will be adequately met. \nI want you to know that you are not alone \u2014 that I am there, sitting right next to you. I feel your frustration when it seems that no one at that table can hear you. I, too, wonder how they are not really hearing me even though I can see them listening. Like you, I am fighting back the tears as they list my child\u2019s challenges but offer little in the way of support \u2014 this phenomenon perplexes me as well. I am your inner voice telling you to remain calm, reminding you that being strong and assertive does not mean having to yell. My palms also are sweating, and my heart is pounding. The constant refrain of \u201cAm I doing and saying enough?\u201d is beating through my mind too. \nI am here to tell you that you are doing enough. You need to know that you are a superstar, a fighter in a way many parents can\u2019t understand. I want you to shrug off the belittling comments you may hear from others \u2014 turn a deaf ear when someone says, \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? It\u2019s just a meeting.\u201d \nIt is a big deal. It\u2019s not just a meeting, and unless you are going through it, you absolutely cannot understand the depth of its importance. I, too, feel misunderstood sometimes \u2014 that many of my mom friends just don\u2019t understand my struggle. I also feel alone and exhausted from trying to explain it. \nDo you know how strong you are? That you are your child\u2019s single most important advocate, teacher, therapist, and psychologist? That you wear many different hats every day just to make sure your child gets from the morning to the night successfully. I know that, whether the teachers across the table from you see it or not. You have the strength of 10,000 men! \nYou alone sit at this meeting to make sure your child receives the educational support they need \u2014 the support that they are legally entitled to and will allow them to successfully navigate the least restrictive educational environment. I jump for joy right along with you when your child thrives and crumble silently inside when they fail. That\u2019s right, IEP Mom, you are a rock, a warrior, and a hero. \nI am right there fighting alongside of you. We all are. So, IEP Mom, go into that meeting with your head held high, your paperwork prepared, and your arguments rehearsed, as this is just another battle in the war that is your child\u2019s education. However, this time, know that I am in a similar room, in a similar school, just a town, state, or country away.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "title": "Dear IEP Mom: It\u2019s That Season Again, But You\u2019re Not Alone", "published": "2017-04-11T04:35:11.603+03:00", "author": "Laura Russin", "external_links": [], "language": "english", "crawled": "2017-04-11T04:35:11.603+03:00", "highlightText": "", "uuid": "6fe2182d5463f1cd9d6024ae6bc49e3392d36e70", "highlightTitle": "", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8C1Q610nHYYevCfzN9JDN6y4W.Oru7k2rp4EinWfVs0GdKHHXwNvUMJ4BF.xyb4vY-", "entities": {"organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "iep"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "laura russin"}], "locations": []}}, {"thread": {"site_categories": ["health", "education"], "main_image": "http://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2017/02/monsanto-e1456383207955.jpg", "domain_rank": 6416, "title": "Monsanto is an evil company that doesn't care about you or the environment", "published": "2017-04-10T19:28:00.000+03:00", "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "site_full": "www.naturalnews.com", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "NaturalNews.com", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 752, "shares": 752}, "gplus": {"shares": 18}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 13}, "linkedin": {"shares": 5}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "participants_count": 1, "site": "naturalnews.com", "title_full": "Monsanto is an evil company that doesn't care about you or the environment", "site_section": "http://www.naturalnews.com/rss.xml", "uuid": "30096d7cd4d03d6e3872ab86cd1221ac107c4433", "country": "US", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_sejtWCbZc4MoE7EUHucFe2XkQogjQWfl.53OzPTcMqyggdjVOdZAP4r7aFvvsKWH_5w7.73lYuCIirr_WCwzJ39vbaQkyb.GCjXI2LZ3DDabCtnnCW7eScMS.4d3fHjPfZuclUzpJEJbzNKfXrxA5", "performance_score": 7}, "rating": null, "text": "Monsanto is an evil company that doesn\u2019t care about you or the environment \n  Vicki Batts Tags: glyphosate , GMO crops , Monsanto \n( Natural News ) Recent lawsuits against Monsanto \u2014 arguably one of the world\u2019s most evil corporations \u2014 continue to highlight the company\u2019s wrongdoings and misdeeds.

And it appears Rowland\u2019s efforts worked, as the report on the herbicidal compound was never published. \nOther emails have revealed that Monsanto\u2019s William Heydens conspired to help ghostwrite a paper on glyphosate\u2019s safety. Specifically, Heydens suggested that Monsanto could author the portions of the paper on exposure toxicity and genotoxicity. In the email, Heydens even recalled how the same method of ghostwriting was used to handle a similar study in the year 2000. \nThen there is the letter from Marion Copley , a now-deceased former EPA scientist. Copley\u2019s letter outlines a number of different ways by which glyphosate can cause cancer and other harmful health effects, such as endocrine disruption and immune system suppression.

Over the course of the company\u2019s many years of existence, Monsanto has unleashed many a toxin into the world. Nary a decade goes by where the corporation isn\u2019t stricken with controversy over some new hazardous chemical they\u2019ve created. Their very first chemical was saccharin, an artificial sweetener, but it was soon followed by the development of PCBs. After 50 years, PCBs were banned due to their toxicity and devastating environmental effects. \nAfter developing their first hybrid seed, Monsanto decided to round-out their company by developing industrial chemicals such as detergents, along with synthetic rubbers and plastics. They also ventured into the agrochemical business with the development of dioxin, a toxic pesticide. Eventually, Monsanto would join forces with DOW Chemical to create Agent Orange \u2014 we all know how that ended: Thousands of American soldiers and Vietnamese citizens were harmed by the use of this toxic concoction. \nInternal memos revealed that Monsanto was well aware of how harmful Agent Orange would be to humans, even before it was sold to the US government. \nMonsanto\u2019s reign of terror doesn\u2019t end with their production of toxic chemicals though, now does it? The GMO giant has also been destroying the agricultural industry from the inside out. GMO crops have been attributed to the rising number of farmer suicides in countries like India. In 2008, it was estimated that some 125,000 Indian farmers had taken their own lives, after being tricked into buying GMO seeds they couldn\u2019t afford \u2014 and never getting the harvests they were promised. When unable to pay back their debts to the industry, these farmers were left with no recourse, and many resorted to unimaginable means to put their anguish to rest. And the number of farmer suicides has only continued to rise: In 2015, it was estimated that 300,000 farmers had taken their own lives in just the last 20 years. \nIn addition to all of this, the farming practices associated with GM crops and the chemicals that go along with them are destroying our environment and arable land at an unprecedented pace. Chemical fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides are not just contaminating our soil but our air and water supplies \u2014 as well as killing off wildlife in every arena. \nTo say Monsanto is evil is putting it mildly: This corporation, and others like them, are not just influencing our government, but destroying our planet and our food supply as we know it.

America, one of the wealthiest nations in the world, has one of the highest infant mortality rates among developed countries. According to the CDC, we lag behind at least 27 of the wealthiest nations in the world when it comes to keeping our infants alive for the first year of life. Finland and Japan are at the top, and the United States is at the very bottom, right under Slovakia. (Check out this chart for a striking visual.) \nIn America, for every 1,000 babies born, an average of 6 die. Yes, some infant deaths are simply going to happen no matter what we do, and this is a sad and tragic fact of life . But many deaths are preventable, as evidenced by the fact that so many other developed countries have a rate about half as high as ours. \nAmerica\u2019s infant mortality rate is embarrassing and unacceptable, especially in a country that is supposed to be on the cutting edge of life-saving medical expertise and treatments. As the CDC explains , a country\u2019s infant mortality rate says a lot about where that country is in terms of overall health and well-being \u201cbecause factors affecting the health of entire populations can also impact the mortality rate of infants.\u201d \nNow, as if this information weren\u2019t upsetting enough, let\u2019s look at the next statistic about infant mortality to come up, right there on the CDC\u2019s information page : \u201cThere are significant differences in infant mortality by race and ethnicity; for instance, the mortality rate for black infants is more than twice that of white infants.\u201d \nYep, you read that right. Black babies are twice as likely to die as white babies. That is a catastrophic difference, especially when you are talking about children \u2014 someone\u2019s baby, someone\u2019s child. It\u2019s a statistic that should anger you to the bone. \nBut even more than that, you should know that although the United States lags behind overall in terms of infant mortality, the rates of infant mortality for babies born to white, educated women is actually on par with that of other nations. As The Nation points out, in a piece published in February called \u201cWhat\u2019s Killing America\u2019s Black Infants?\u201d the babies who are most likely to die in their first year of life are those born to \u201cpoorer, less-educated families, particularly those headed by unmarried or black women.\u201d \nSo infant mortality is a huge, reprehensible problem in America, but black babies are the ones most affected and disproportionately so. The article in The Nation is an important, heartbreaking work of investigative reporting that should be required reading for all Americans, parents or not. Zo\u00eb Carpenter, the author, unpacks the major reasons why the infant mortality rate is so much higher for black babies. The conclusion she comes to is complex, but it boils down to this: Black babies are dying at higher rates than white babies because of racial discrimination \u2014 on economic, social, and psychological levels. \nCarpenter explains that it\u2019s a deep kind of racism that goes beyond the socioeconomic barriers that many people of color face. For example, even among highly educated black women, the rates of infant death are higher than their white counterparts of similar socioeconomic status. According to Carpenter, regardless of where they come from, what they have achieved, and what economic advantages they have garnered, black women are treated differently than white women, including in the arena of pregnancy and birth. \n\u201cA growing body of evidence points to racial discrimination, rather than race itself, as the dominant factor in explaining why so many black babies are dying,\u201d Carpenter explains. Carpenter believes that institutional racism, which she refers to as \u201cunequal treatment [that] has been baked into our social, economic, and political systems,\u201d is to blame here, and its effects have been felt in black communities for decades. \nCarpenter surmises that institutional racism may be affecting women and babies on a chronic level, affecting their response to stress, and overall health, especially during the childbearing years. \u201cThese various forms of discrimination, stacked up over a lifetime, can cause chronic stress, which in turn can damage the biological systems necessary for a healthy pregnancy and birth,\u201d says Carpenter. \nAround the time this article came out, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) released a statement about racial discrimination in the maternity care industry. The gist of their statement is that racial discrimination in maternity care exists, it\u2019s not okay, and healthcare professionals working with women of color need to be aware of their biases and the different kinds of obstacles black women and their babies face. \n\u201cRacial bias is an issue that affects our patients, either directly by subjecting them or their families to inequitable treatment, or indirectly by creating a stressful and unhealthy environment,\u201d the statement reads, going on to say that \u201c[i]t is critical that physicians are aware of this reality for patients of color regardless of the patient\u2019s financial position.\u201d \nStatements like this are a good start, though they will mean very little unless there is follow-up, dialogue, and efforts made to work through the deeply rooted racism inherent in our health care system, our country, and ourselves. I am someone who keeps up with health care issues as they pertain to women and children, and although I knew about the different rates of infant mortality between black and white babies, it wasn\u2019t until I read the article in The Nation that I fully understood how deep it really goes and how vital it is to address it immediately. \nI don\u2019t know what the solution is exactly, and I know it might take years to fully untangle it all and address it. As a white woman, I can\u2019t speak to the personal experience of my black friends and what they need most as women, as people, and as a community so their babies remain healthy and are able to thrive. But by god, it\u2019s about time we start talking about it , acknowledging how utterly unacceptable it is, and band together to fight the good fight for the moms and babies who deserve the simple promise of a good, healthy start in life.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "title": "Infant Mortality Rates Are Twice As High For Black Babies, And That Is A Big F*cking Deal", "published": "2017-04-11T04:35:08.200+03:00", "author": "Wendy Wisner", "external_links": [], "language": "english", "crawled": "2017-04-11T04:35:08.200+03:00", "highlightText": "", "uuid": "cf17434ae6c46f0f77ab8ead37b2b9b90cf9e430", "highlightTitle": "", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8C1Q610nHYYevCfzN9JDN6JVe_KRpdMe1apyEOe.wap2pn2MPo_QMeSsKyPLDtTiprlksSvuItY.VXWEevm6sY", "entities": {"organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "infant mortality rates are twice as high for black babies"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "congress of obstetricians"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "acog"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cdc"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "wendy wisner"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "zo\u00eb carpenter"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "carpenter"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "america"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "united states"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "slovakia"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "finland"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "killing america"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "japan"}]}}, {"thread": {"site_categories": ["health", "education"], "main_image": "http://www.naturalnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2017/02/monsanto-e1456383207955.jpg", "domain_rank": 6416, "title": "Monsanto is an evil company that doesn't care about you or the environment", "published": "2017-04-10T19:28:00.000+03:00", "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "site_full": "naturalnews.com", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "NaturalNews.com", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 752, "shares": 752}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 5}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}}, "participants_count": 1, "site": "naturalnews.com", "title_full": "Monsanto is an evil company that doesn't care about you or the environment", "site_section": "http://naturalnews.com/rss.xml", "uuid": "39a103dcd7229834e7a9d81ba299082dc7076a2a", "country": "US", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/snFTpiOKdJXUmbhBqaECsm7h5AXk2lXXiDlt6YSffExw4QClk3vm7RVwlpSlw5fEdAo9wEzxDC.XSObc27fqGniaaxRTxmORA1jrAlaoLbpfxefDiLOHJoSvvF9HecrVS2NHyxZYJKZDutDGZyrtGfyXClIG80Vv", "performance_score": 7}, "rating": null, "text": "Monsanto is an evil company that doesn\u2019t care about you or the environment \nMonday, April 10, 2017 by: Vicki Batts Tags: glyphosate , GMO crops , Monsanto \n( Natural News ) Recent lawsuits against Monsanto \u2014 arguably one of the world\u2019s most evil corporations \u2014 continue to highlight the company\u2019s wrongdoings and misdeeds.

The case of Poul Thorsen, for example, stands out in terms of shameless audacity\u2014stealing grant money meant for autism research. His actions only add to the questions of alleged corruption surrounding the Danish Studies designed to erase any association between vaccines and autism, sponsored by the world\u2019s premier public health agency: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \nOne might expect fraud and corruption in government, but many Americans will be surprised to hear of it inside the CDC, the same agency that fumbled the arrival of Ebola virus on US shores in 2014. The fact that the CDC would contract with the likes of Dr. Thorsen on crucial research of vaccines and autism, and never consider setting aside his findings after his twenty-two-count criminal indictment, speaks to the waning credibility of the world\u2019s premiere public health agency. \nINTRODUCTION BY ROBERT F. KENNEDY JR. \nStatistics don\u2019t lie, the saying goes, but statisticians do. As an environmental lawyer and veteran of hundreds of legal battles with some of the world\u2019s biggest polluters, I know that statistical\u2014or epidemiological studies\u2014are the go-to weapon of industry junk scientists. These hired guns\u2014so called tobacco scientists\u2014know that \u201cfixing the science\u201d or an epidemiological study is as easy as lighting up a smoke. For example, one could easily design an epidemiological study to \u201cprove\u201d that sex does not make one pregnant. The trick is simply to get rid of all the pregnant people before one analyzes the data. Now you have a study that shows lots of people having sex without consequence. Voila! That\u2019s one of the many tricks CDC\u2019s star biostitute, Poul Thorsen, used to deceive the public about the evidence linking mercury laced vaccines to autism. Prior to conducting his MMR study, Thorsen used \u201cexclusions\u201d to eliminate children with autism from the target population. Employing this and an inventory of other magician subterfuges, Thorsen authored a Danish study that CDC, for years, has been presenting as its gold standard evidence that thimerosal doesn\u2019t cause autism. \nThis is a story of how CDC used a con man to gull the public and ended up getting conned itself! Poul Thorsen is a world-class villain whose manipulation of health data gave CDC and big pharma what they wanted: a report clearing thimerosal of any possible role in the autism crisis. His story merits a book length expose because the fraud he casually helped orchestrate has had a monumental impact on the health of millions of children globally. \nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) most often cites Poul Thorsens crooked research as the final word on the controversy linking vaccines to autism. CDC rarely mentions that Poul Thorsen is the subject of a twenty-two-count, 2011 indictment by the U.S. Department of justice for wire fraud and money laundering in connection with more than $1 million in research grants that he pilfered from CDC while he ginned up fraudulent studies to \u201cprove\u201d that vaccines don\u2019t cause autism.1 His crimes have won him a mug shot on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) \u201cmost wanted\u201d list.2 Thorsen\u2019s former employer, Aarhus University\u2014Denmark\u2019s university hospital system\u2014permanently expelled him from practice in 2010.The fact that he is roaming free in Denmark and is easy to find, despite the federal indictment, indicates a lack of enthusiasm by HHS to file the necessary extradition papers and press for his capture. The agency has good reason to fear that a public trial would expose the pervasive corruption throughout CDC\u2019s vaccine division and the fragility of the science supporting CDC\u2019s claims about vaccine safety. \nDr. Thorsen is one of seven co-authors and the data manager for the two leading foreign studies offered by CDC as the foundation for its claims that vaccines do not cause autism. For nearly a decade, critics have pointed out that CDC\u2019s Danish studies are thinly veiled flimflam.3 Besides employing the threadworm gimmick of manipulating exclusions to selectively eliminate kids, on some studies, with autism diagnoses from the study pool,Thorsen and his co-author used another novel dodge to \u201cexculpate\u201d mercury-laced vaccines. Thorsen\u2019s trick was not even a sophisticated brand of junk science, but it was a devastatingly effective way to deliver the conclusion CDC wanted. Thorsen\u2019s Madsen et al. 2003 (\u201cMadsen 2003\u201d),4 purported to exonerate thimerosal\u2014the mercury-based vaccine preservative as the causative agent in the autism epidemic by showing that autism rates in Denmark increased after the Danish government removed thimerosal from vaccines in 1992.5 But even the most casual critic could see that the increase in Danish autism was illusory since it was not actually based on an increased incidence of the disease. It was simply an artifact of Denmark\u2019s new reporting protocols. \nHere\u2019s how Thorsen and his cronies pulled off this fraud: In 1993, the same year Denmark removed thimerosal-containing vaccines from distribution, it coincidentally required, for the first time, that outpatient autism cases be reported on the government s national disease registry. Prior to 1993, only inpatient cases were reported. These represented less than 10 percent of the total. Denmark\u2019s new reporting protocols increased the reported autism incidence cases by nearly 1300 percent. Dr.Thorsen and his pals took advantage of that artificial rise to suggest that real autism incidence had increased following thi-merosal\u2019s ban.The authors also violated established peer-review scientific protocols by deleting the entire 2001-year class of seven-year-olds from the final published version.6 That deletion was flagrant research fraud. The 2001 cohort was the first to be entirely free from thimerosal exposure in their vaccines. The subsequent analysis (Gronborg et al. 2013) of that data showed a steady decline in autism rates over a ten-year period following the removal of thimerosal in 1992. \nEmails obtained under the Freedom of Information laws show that Thorsen, his co-authors, and CDC officials were all aware of these frauds when they published the study. Responsible journals, including Lancet and JAMA, rejected the Madsen study. It took a letter from the CDC\u2019s Jose Cordero, then director of its new National Center for Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities (NCBDDD),7 to strong-arm a lesser journal, Pediatrics, to finally publish the study. Pediatrics has earned notoriety as a frequent publisher of vaccine industry junk science. Pediatrics raises a substantial portion of its operating budget from vaccine makers. Pediatrics is the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which is notorious for its conflicts with big donors. In 2016, the AAP was forced to drop its multi-million donor, Coca-Cola, as it\u2019s only \u201cgold sponsor.\u201d In exchange for $3 million over six years, AAP had been shilling for the sugary drink maker, which it called a distinguished company due to Coke\u2019s commitment to \u201cbetter the health of children worldwide. AAP only ended the mercenary romance when published exposes disclosed that Coke had been paying hired scientists to fix the science to \u201cprove\u201d that sugary drinks were not the culprit in the obesity epidemic. \nAt the 2007 National Academy of Sciences/Institute of Medicine (IOM) meeting, \u201cAutism and the Environment: Challenges and Opportunity for Research,\u201d Dr. Irva Hertz-Picciotti, an internationally renowned environmental epidemiologist from the University of California, Davis, criticized the Madsen 2003 study for deliberately blurring outpatient and inpatient data sets: \u201cThe study, therefore is not a rigorous design, because you cannot compare the before and after periods because of artifacts in how the database was constructed, and specifically how it changed over time.\u201d When CDC scientists finally took an authentic look at the Danish autism data a decade later, they demolished the conclusions in Madsen 2003. CDC\u2019s subsequent study, Gronborg et al. 2013, published in JAMA Pediatrics8 directly contradicted Thorsen and Madsen. Gronborg and her co-authors found a 33 percent drop in autism spectrum disorder incidence in Denmark following the withdrawal of thimerosal in 1992. \nThorsen was also data manager for Kreesten Madsen\u2019s companion study on the MMR vaccine, Madsen et al 2002.9 That study used similar deceptive statistical devices and flawed data to \u201cprove\u201d MMR safety.10 That study employed CDC\u2019s trademark ruse of including many children who were too young to receive the autism diagnosis, which at that point usually occurred at age four in Denmark. CDC epidemiologists have consistently used this ploy in their phony autism research to dampen the autism signal in various studies.The 2002 Madsen MMR study also included a substantial number of unvaccinated children and employed a suite of other statistical gimmicks to mask the association with the MMR vaccine and dampen the autism signal. \nHaving trained in CDC\u2019s sophisticated fraud during his apprenticeship with the two notorious Madsen studies, it\u2019s no wonder that Poul Thorsen felt so at ease stealing more than $1 million that CDC had directed Thorsen to spend on managing data for those and other studies. \nAs James Grundvig brilliantly points out in the pages that follow, without Poul Thorsen, there would have been no Danish studies for the CDC to misuse all these years as the spear tip for its propaganda campaign on vaccine safety. \nHowever, Grundvig gives us more; Thorsen was not a lone bad apple. Grundvig shows that CDC insiders, including Dr. Frank DeStefano (Director of the Immunization Safety Office); Dr. Marshalyn-Yeargin-Allsopp (Head of the Developmental Disabilities Branch); Dr. Diana Schendel, a CDC epidemiologist research scientist and Thorsen s longtime girlfriend, who in 2014 took a permanent position in the epidemiology department at Aarhus University, where Thorsen committed the theft of autism research money; and Dr. Coleen Boyle (Director of the National Center for Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities) fully supported and orchestrated Thorsen s fraud. Boyle made her bones at CDC as lead investigator of 1984-1987 Congressional investigation of Agent Orange. In that post, Boyle and her team reported \u201cno association\u201d between the jungle defoliant dioxin and the grim inventory of rare cancers and autoimmune diseases that sickened tens of thousands of U.S. troops who fought in the war. Her work allowed the government to deny benefits and treatment for sickened soldiers for five years. In 1990, the Pentagon admitted during congressional hearings that Agent Orange was indeed the culprit.Today, Boyle is the director of CDC\u2019s National Center for Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities. According to Dr. William Thompson, a seventeen-year CDC senior vaccine safety scientist and current CDC employee who recently filed for whistleblower status, Boyle and her team of researchers committed research fraud in a subsequent 2004 American study to conceal numbers suggesting that the MMR vaccine was associated with higher rates of autism in African-American children. \nPoul Thorsen, the Master Manipulator, is the dark wizard of a federal agency that is steeped in corruption and compromised by financial entanglements with the pharmaceutical industry. Thorsen participated in a criminal conspiracy with his CDC bosses to distort science and fleece the American taxpayer. He then turned on his cronies and stole the money CDC paid him to conjure up his phony research. Thorsen\u2019s greatest crime, however, is the epidemic of millions of children with developmental disabilities who are the legacy of his fraud. \nDr. Poul Thorsen should be arrested and brought back to the United States to stand trial and receive justice. If that happens, we might see those in the CDC who sponsored his fraud be held finally accountable. \n1 \u201cUnited States of America vs. Poul Thorsen\u201d indictment, U.S. DOJ, April 13, 2011. \n2 https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/fugitives/profiles.asp \n3 \u201cMethodological Issues and Evidence of Malfeasance in Research Purporting to Show Thimerosal in Vaccines Is Safe,\u201d Brian Hooker et ah, BioMed Research International,Vol. 2014. \n4 \u201cThimerosal and the Occurrence of Autism: Negative Ecological Evidence From Danish Population-Based Data,\u201d Kreesten Madsen etal., Pediatrics, September 1, 2003. \n5 Dr. M.

Share: FULL STORY Exercise enthusiasts often wonder whether it's better to eat or fast before a workout. A new study is the first of its kind to show the effects of eating versus fasting on gene expression in adipose (fat) tissue in response to exercise. This study highlights the different roles fat plays in powering and responding to exercise. The study is published ahead of print in the American Journal of Physiology -- Endocrinology and Metabolism . \nResearchers from the University of Bath in the U.K. studied a group of overweight males. The volunteers walked for 60 minutes at 60 percent maximum oxygen consumption on an empty stomach and, on another occasion, two hours after consuming a high-calorie carbohydrate-rich breakfast. The research team took multiple blood samples after eating or fasting and after exercising. The researchers also collected adipose tissue samples immediately before and one hour after walking. \nGene expression in the adipose tissue differed significantly in the two trials. The expression of two genes, PDK4 and HSL, increased when the men fasted and exercised and decreased when they ate before exercising. The rise in PDK4 likely indicates that stored fat was used to fuel metabolism during exercise instead of carbohydrates from the recent meal. HSL typically increases when adipose tissue uses stored energy to support increased activity, such as during exercise, explained Dylan Thompson, corresponding author of the study. \nThese results reinforce the view that \"adipose tissue often faces competing challenges,\" Thompson wrote. After eating, adipose tissue \"is busy responding to the meal and a bout of exercise at this time will not stimulate the same [beneficial] changes in adipose tissue. This means that exercise in a fasted state might provoke more favorable changes in adipose tissue, and this could be beneficial for health in the long term,\" he noted. \nStory Source: \nMaterials provided by American Physiological Society (APS) .

He doesn\u2019t read the directions; he is not overwhelmed by this stuff like I am. He unwraps everything, sorts the pieces (he has to sort the pieces), then he gets to work. \n\u201cWe can figure it out, Mom,\u201d he reassures me as he quickly looks at the pictures, picks up a few pieces from his piles, feels them, studies each one, then begins putting the cabinet together. He constantly cracks his knuckles as he pauses to think about what he needs to do next. It\u2019s his latest habit. Before that he would pinch his neck, leaving dark bruises. Before that, he sucked his fingers with one hand and played with his privates with the other \u2014 we\u2019ve come a long way \u2014 so I don\u2019t mind the constant cracking. \nHe saved my sanity once again by helping me put this monster together. I should not be allowed to buy anything with the \u201csome assembly required\u201d warning on the box, but I do it anyway when I fall in love with a piece of furniture online because I know he will help me, and he enjoys it. Together we have built a desk, a dresser, two cabinets, and a chair (with only minimal swearing on my part). \nThis boy, he amazes me every day with his quick wit and sense of humor. He is caring and so smart, but oh my lord, he is constantly moving. Constantly . And sometimes, it drives me bonkers , and I have to bite my tongue. \nHis teachers have helped me tremendously. They were they ones who approached me and said he needed movement in order to learn to his full potential. They gave him a big, bouncy ball to sit on in class. The students are also allowed to chew gum in class now, and they provide \u201cfidgets,\u201d also known as stress balls, so that the kids have a way to move and exert energy without creating a disruption. It has helped my son a great deal to have the support of his teachers, but it has also helped me too. He still needs a daily reminder to try to stay focused, but as he has grown, his impulse control has gotten stronger, and I owe so much to the teachers who helped me understand my son was not just being a brat \u2014 he has a difficult time controlling his urges to move. So I have taken what they taught me and implemented it at home as well, and it has made a huge difference. \nIf I take him to a sporting event \u2014 something we do all the time because his older siblings play \u2014 he dreads it. Sitting there for a few hours just watching something happen is torture for him. We never leave the house without a stress ball, gum, and a book. He still has to squirm a bit, but he chomps down on his gum and squeezes that ball like his life depends on it. Wearing a coat seems to help him too. He says it makes him feel comfortable and warm. It obviously has a calming effect on him, and sometimes he even wears his winter coat to bed. \nIf we go to the movies, even one he has been dying to see, he still needs a fidget to keep his hands busy along with his snack. I watch him stare at the screen in a daze while he goes to town squeezing the ball. The times we forget it, I can see how much harder it is for him to get comfortable, settle in, and enjoy himself, even if it is something he has been looking forward to. \nLong car rides when he was younger used to be total hell until I figured out he needs some way to move while strapped into his seat . \nWhile doing his homework, he sometimes has to walk around or swivel on the stool at our kitchen island in order to get it done. He loves sitting on the big bouncy balls too. \nI know now that a lot of kids are fidgety, and just because my son needs to do things differently than his older siblings, who have no problem sitting still, doesn\u2019t mean he is a \u201cbad\u201d kid. All children need movement \u2014 they crave twisting and turning their bodies. They love to roll down hills, climb on things, run, jump, and dance. My son is just needs more than most kids. \nIf you have a fidgety child who never sits still, you know how stressful it can be. I feel horrible that sometimes his squirming takes me to a bad place because I know he cannot help it. It doesn\u2019t matter if he has been on his bike for hours or played 10 games of tag \u2014 the kid just needs to move his body around while he is awake. \nMemory and movement are linked. My son learns better by doing than he does through reflection, and I need to be patient and allow him to learn in his own way. And the bonus here is I will always have a little helper when I make an impulse purchase at IKEA.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "title": "Life With A Fidgety Child: My Kid Never Stops Moving", "published": "2017-04-11T04:35:05.719+03:00", "author": "Katie Bingham-Smith", "external_links": [], "language": "english", "crawled": "2017-04-11T04:35:05.719+03:00", "highlightText": "", "uuid": "ecd3c90ddb432ba081066234aaeca606b3c5b3f3", "highlightTitle": "", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8C1Q610nHYYevCfzN9JDN66px.jqI3JcqEvzsBA0V8ohQ_3VZbYJ3vwSIMlbSsuNs-", "entities": {"organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "ikea"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "neutral", "name": "katie bingham-smith"}], "locations": []}}, {"thread": {"site_categories": ["health"], "main_image": "http://images.lifescript.com/Media/B/6/6/B661E1CD-55AD-4D0B-80A6-C32E329C6EE1vision-problems.jpg", "domain_rank": 3485, "title": "Migraine Relief: 10 Myths and Facts", "published": "2017-04-08T08:00:00.000+03:00", "site_type": "news", "spam_score": 0.0, "site_full": "www.lifescript.com", "replies_count": 0, "section_title": "Lifescript", "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 589, "shares": 589}, "gplus": {"shares": 105}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 48}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 1}}, "participants_count": 0, "site": "lifescript.com", "title_full": "Migraine Relief: 10 Myths and Facts", "site_section": "http://www.lifescript.com/rss/RSSHealth.aspx", "uuid": "54d282b06cd7cb9685b15f8d8638478d4dd9f08d", "country": "US", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9.8lin9IFOcnDqCkY8A.gPWV4ChcdOdb1cS1839USpTX54MbLzJCFm9X1NfnyvQ9VoTf4U2OrGynt6JC_BmzNSf0aZdRaqLfB3ICK.no2QOKmfioXaIQZC336tKmQY1YjSXVhjM_l6YQ--", "performance_score": 5}, "rating": null, "text": "NEXT M igraines are more than just bad headaches.

Read on as Lifescript\u2019s Health Detective reveals the truth behind 10 common migraine myths... You wake up to throbbing pain on one side of your head. The sun streaming through the bedroom window scorches your eyes like a lightning flash. Moving your head even slightly is excruciating. Like 35 million other Americans, you\u2019re in the throes of a migraine \u2013 the most common cause of disabling headaches. About 18% of women and 6% of men experience the brain disorder, according to the Migraine Research Foundation (MRF), a Manhattan-based nonprofit organization that provides information and support. Even some physicians don\u2019t recognize the cluster of symptoms that makes up migraines \u2013 such as headache, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances and sensitivity to noises and smells. As a result, they may dismiss a severe migraine headache and other symptoms as \u201cwomen\u2019s problems,\u201d such as premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or depression. \u201cBecause the problem is related to their head, patients sometimes feel that doctors think they\u2019re making the symptoms up, causing their own headaches, or overreacting,\u201d says Cathy Glaser, MRF co-founder and president. M igraines are more than just bad headaches. But many people \u2013 and even some doctors \u2013 don\u2019t fully understand this complex condition or what\u2019s required for migraine pain relief. Read on as Lifescript\u2019s Health Detective reveals the truth behind 10 common migraine myths... Lack of training is a pervasive problem, says neurologist Peter Goadsby, MD, PhD, director of the University of California, San Francisco Headache Program. \u201cIf physicians aren\u2019t exposed to current information, they have to fill in the blanks themselves,\u201d he explains. The result: Along with debilitating symptoms, migraine patients often endure a variety of myths about the condition. If you suffer from migraines, it\u2019s important to stay informed. Here, Lifescript\u2019s Health Detective separates fact from fiction. Migraine pain myth #1: Migraines are just bad headaches . Reality check: Not so! Migraine is a syndrome in which \u201cmultiple symptoms often occur simultaneously because of a cascade of brain events,\u201d says Joel R. Saper, MD, director of the Michigan Head-Pain & Neurological Institute in Ann Arbor, Mich. Those brain events release pain-producing inflammatory substances around the nerves and blood vessels of the head. The cause is unknown, but the result isn\u2019t: Disabling symptoms that often send sufferers to bed. Interestingly, some people don\u2019t have pain, though severe pain is the most common symptom of a migraine. In such cases, people often have visual auras and other migraine symptoms, such as nausea. \u201cBut if they do [have pain], it might be minor compared to the drama of nausea, stroke-like symptoms and memory changes,\u201d Dr. Saper says. Though ordinary headaches result from a narrowing of blood vessels and can often be eased with aspirin, migraines are caused by the expansion of blood vessels. Certain treatments may provide migraine relief, but there\u2019s no cure. M igraines are more than just bad headaches. But many people \u2013 and even some doctors \u2013 don\u2019t fully understand this complex condition or what\u2019s required for migraine pain relief. Read on as Lifescript\u2019s Health Detective reveals the truth behind 10 common migraine myths... Migraine pain myth #2: Migraines occur only in women. Reality check: Under age 12, an equal number of boys and girls have migraines, Dr. Saper says. After the onset of puberty, men still get them, but women with the condition outnumber them 3-1. The main reason is estrogen and progesterone, which play a significant role in the disorder, according to epidemiological and clinical studies. The two hormones help regulate pregnancy, during which migraines may \u201csettle down,\u201d Dr. Goadsby says. Menopause may also bring migraine relief, he adds. Higher estrogen levels sometimes improve migraines, while lower levels may make them worse, according to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. Some women get their first migraine headache after starting on birth control pills; for others, oral contraceptives improve the headache pattern, the clinic says. Migraine pain myth #3: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) causes migraines. Reality check: The two conditions are sometimes connected, but \u201cnot all women with periods have PMS, and not all women with migraines have PMS,\u201d Dr. Saper says. Migraines are sensitive to hormonal fluctuations, which occur before a woman\u2019s period. An attack that comes within two days before or three days after a period, known as a \u201cmenstrual migraine,\u201d is similar to other migraines but usually doesn\u2019t include an aura (visual disturbances). Women who experience menstrual migraines can sometimes get relief from continuous birth control pills, which reduce the number of periods to four per year. Here are other treatments for menstrual migraines . M igraines are more than just bad headaches. But many people \u2013 and even some doctors \u2013 don\u2019t fully understand this complex condition or what\u2019s required for migraine pain relief. Read on as Lifescript\u2019s Health Detective reveals the truth behind 10 common migraine myths... Migraine pain myth #4: Women get migraines because they\u2019re more emotional. Reality check: \u201cThat\u2019s nonsense,\u201d Dr. Goadsby says. \u201cThe \u2018hysterical female\u2019 argument is embarrassing.\u201d \u201cWomen, like men, get migraines because something\u2019s going on in their brains,\u201d says Glaser of the MRF. \u201cThey\u2019re usually born with that trait. The question is: If you have the trait, what triggers the migraine?\u201d For both men and women, emotional stress may release chemicals that provoke migraine-causing vascular expansion in the brain, according to Harvard Medical School\u2019s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC). \u201cIf life is stressful \u2013 you have a bad marriage, you\u2019re hurt \u2013 you may be more vulnerable to migraines,\u201d Dr. Saper says. The letdown after a stressful period also may be a migraine trigger. Remember, though, that \u201clots of women are stressed and don\u2019t get migraines,\u201d Glaser says. \u201cYou have to have the trait.\u201d M igraines are more than just bad headaches. But many people \u2013 and even some doctors \u2013 don\u2019t fully understand this complex condition or what\u2019s required for migraine pain relief. Read on as Lifescript\u2019s Health Detective reveals the truth behind 10 common migraine myths... Migraine pain myth #5: Painkillers are enough for migraine relief. Reality check: Because migraines can provoke multiple symptoms, one pain medicine won\u2019t necessarily sweep them away, Dr. Goadsby says. \u201cThere are more than 100 treatments and prevention methods for migraines,\u201d Glaser says. \u201cIf patients could pop just one pill, they\u2019d be doing it.\u201d Although painkillers often are prescribed for migraines, they\u2019re not the most effective treatment, experts say. They don\u2019t work, for example, against triggers such as movement or noise, which may exacerbate symptoms. Other medications can target symptoms in addition to migraine headache. But some have serious side effects, especially if patients also use painkillers regularly. \u201cThe more painkillers you take, the greater the potential for more headaches,\u201d Dr. Saper says. Called medication overuse headaches , or rebound headaches , these are more like tension headaches than migraines, Dr. Saper says. Using painkillers 2-3 times weekly over several months may make patients more vulnerable to them. There are serious health dangers from painkiller overuse . Pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil) and acetaminophen (Tylenol) help relieve mild migraine symptoms, but they shouldn\u2019t be used to treat moderate or severe migraines, according to the Mayo Clinic. Synthetic narcotics known as opioids, such as hydrocodone (Vicodin), can be more effective, but they \u201cchange the nervous system and make it easier to get the next attack,\u201d Dr. Saper warns. They also can be addictive. M igraines are more than just bad headaches. But many people \u2013 and even some doctors \u2013 don\u2019t fully understand this complex condition or what\u2019s required for migraine pain relief. Read on as Lifescript\u2019s Health Detective reveals the truth behind 10 common migraine myths... Other drugs may help patients with more severe symptoms, including: Triptans : They work with brain chemistry to constrict blood vessels, helping relieve migraine pain, nausea and sensitivity to light and sound. Ergot : These combine caffeine with ergotamine, another blood-vessel constrictor, and work best in patients who have pain lasting more than 48 hours. Dexamethasone : This corticosteroid reduces inflammation and may be used with other medications for migraine pain relief; it\u2019s taken infrequently because of the risk of side effects. Tricyclic antidepressants : This form of antidepressant medication may help prevent migraines by altering brain chemistry, whether or not you have depression. Beta blockers : Commonly used to treat high blood pressure and coronary heart disease, these drugs reduce the frequency and severity of migraines. Anti-nausea medications : These help with the migraine symptoms of nausea and vomiting. There\u2019s another drug treatment that you may not be aware of \u2014 one popularly known to fight wrinkles: Following two clinical studies published in the medical journal Cephalalgia in 2010, the FDA approved Botox (OnabotulinumtoxinA) for the treatment of chronic migraine headaches. The studies were double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled with more than 1,300 study participants. At the end of the two clinical trials, the researchers concluded that Botox is safe and effective for the prevention of chronic migraines in adults. Multiple studies since have shown the continuing effectiveness of Botox treatment for chronic migraines. New treatments for migraine sufferers are emerging all the time. In 2014, the first medical device was approved by the FDA to prevent migraines in adults, providing an alternative to medication. According to the FDA, Cefaly is a small, portable, battery-powered, prescription device that resembles a plastic headband worn across the forehead and atop the ears. The user positions the device in the center of the forehead, just above the eyes, using a self-adhesive electrode. The device applies an electric current to the skin and underlying body tissues to stimulate branches of the trigeminal nerve, which has been associated with migraine headaches. The user may feel a tingling or massaging sensation where the electrode is applied. It is directed for use once per day for 20 minutes. M igraines are more than just bad headaches. But many people \u2013 and even some doctors \u2013 don\u2019t fully understand this complex condition or what\u2019s required for migraine pain relief. Read on as Lifescript\u2019s Health Detective reveals the truth behind 10 common migraine myths... Migraine pain myth #6: Migraines aren\u2019t hereditary. Reality check: The child of one parent with migraines has a 50% chance of having them too, and the risk climbs to 75% if both parents experience them, according to BIDMC. The risk is 20% if even a distant relative has the disorder. A boy may inherit the gene, but is less likely to get migraines, Dr. Goadsby says. But he can pass the trait on to his daughters, who are more likely to experience symptoms. Migraine pain myth #7: Migraines are caused by psychological problems. Reality check: Migraines, depression and anxiety often travel together. The causes may overlap \u2013 a risk of depression , for example, can also be hereditary \u2013 but one condition doesn\u2019t lead to the others. Not everyone with depression gets migraines, and vice versa, Dr. Saper says. \u201cYou can treat someone with depression with antidepressants, but that doesn\u2019t mean it will help the migraine,\u201d Dr. Goadsby says. And \u201cyou can give anti-migraine medications to a migraine patient, but she\u2019ll still have depressive disorder.\u201d \u201cThe two are related only by shared brain chemistry,\u201d he says. Migraine pain myth #8: Caffeine helps relieve migraines. Reality check: It helps some people \u2013 but for others, it\u2019s a migraine trigger, according to BIDMC. Caffeine can help relieve a mild or moderate migraine headache if you don\u2019t consume much of it daily, Dr. Saper says. But 4-5 cups of coffee per day may foster a caffeine dependency, and overnight withdrawal from the stimulant could trigger a migraine the next morning. To help determine whether caffeine affects your condition, keep a headache diary to note if you get migraine symptoms after consuming caffeinated beverages, BIDMC suggests. M igraines are more than just bad headaches. But many people \u2013 and even some doctors \u2013 don\u2019t fully understand this complex condition or what\u2019s required for migraine pain relief. Read on as Lifescript\u2019s Health Detective reveals the truth behind 10 common migraine myths... Migraine pain myth #9: Certain foods trigger migraines. Reality check: Some migraine patients are sensitive to: Cheese, which contains a natural compound called tyramine Chocolate, which has caffeine Processed meats made with nitrates But many others never suffer a migraine headache from food, Dr. Saper says. \u201cIt could be 100 different triggers,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to identify them.\u201d If you often get symptoms after eating a particular food, keep a diary to track what you\u2019ve eaten when you develop symptoms, Glaser advises. These 5 foods can ease migraines . It also matters when you eat. Inconsistent mealtimes can set off migraines. \u201cEat at the same time every day,\u201d Dr. Saper advises. \u201cMissing or delaying meals are often a key migraine trigger.\u201d Exercising and going to bed at the same time daily is also wise, he adds. M igraines are more than just bad headaches. But many people \u2013 and even some doctors \u2013 don\u2019t fully understand this complex condition or what\u2019s required for migraine pain relief.

Reality check: Stress can be a migraine trigger, but \u201cit doesn\u2019t matter whether a woman is under stress in an office or at home with kids,\u201d Dr. Goadsby says. Stress-reducing techniques , such as meditation, may help manage migraines. It isn\u2019t just a women\u2019s issue either. \u201cIt\u2019s a myth that stress applies to women more than men,\u201d Dr. Saper says. Don\u2019t let this, or any other migraine myth, deter you from living your life and getting proper treatment, Dr. Goadsby says. \u201cYou\u2019re not crazy, weak or second-rate if you have migraines,\u201d he says. \u201cYou have a genuine, biologically determined problem.

Opinions about their safety are divided. While one site suggests a strong link between neonicotinoid use and local pollinator collapses combined with adverse health effects in other animals, another site, consisting of agricultural research, contests the insecticides\u2019 notorious bee-killing reputation. \nThis class of agricultural chemicals is one of the most commonly used insecticides across the country. Since neonics, as they are nicknamed, were released in the 1990s as the more environmentally-friendly pesticides on the market, nobody has ever questioned their safety on human health, until recently. Past research found that neonics not only wreak havoc on the nervous systems of insects, but they may also cause developmental or neurological problems in humans too. \nIn 2015, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) first started to detect neonicotinoid pollutants in more than half of the samples taken from streams and rivers throughout the United States. Alarmed by these findings, chemists and engineers at the USGS and University of Iowa wanted to investigate if neonicotinoids also end up in the tap water millions of Americans drink or use for cooking. Are there dangerous insecticides lurking in your drinking water? \nFor the very first time, Gregory H. LeFevre, a University of Iowa environmental engineer, and his colleagues have identified neonicotinoids in treated tap water. Touted as being safer than other chemicals on the market, some experts found that chronic, low-level exposure to neonicotinoids can attack cells in the human nervous system, which could result in memory loss, according to Japanese researchers. \nFurthermore, these nicotine-like insecticides bind and activate receptors in cells located in the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system. Overstimulation of these receptors can cause paralysis and even death, reported the Daily Mail Online . \nCo-author Dr. Gregory LeFevre told The Washington Post that while these findings are important, they are not a reason for immediate alarm. The samples were taken over a seven-week span, just after the region\u2019s farmers planted maize and soy seeds, which are often coated with neonicotinoids. \nThe scientists tested water that went through two different water treatment systems. One system, serving Iowa City, using granular activated carbon filtration that dissolves organic compounds, removed 100 percent of clothianidin, 94 percent of imidacloprid, and 85 percent of thiamethoxam. The rapid sand filtration system serving the University of Iowa, however, was only able to remove about one percent, eight percent, and 44 percent of the same neonics. These results prompted the university to install a similar water filtration system on its campus. No regulations of neonicotinoid levels in our drinking water \nSince there are no conclusive research papers available linking neonics to adverse health effects in humans, regulators and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA ) have not yet identified safe levels of neonicotinoids in drinking water. \nIn an email to the Washington Post , Dr. Melissa Perry, a public health researcher at George Washington University, said that there is currently no national effort being made to measure the level of neonics that are ending up into our bodies, be it through water or food. \nShe added that more comprehensive assessments are needed to detect if common neonics are also contaminating public water supplies in other parts of the country. The new study provides further evidence that neonics are present in our daily environments and, in order to protect public health, should not be ignored. \nNot sure if your tap water is fit for human consumption?
