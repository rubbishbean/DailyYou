I just received mine today, and it only took 5 days to arrive here. It comes with the Console, Wireless Controller, and both the Cords it needs. It's black (Looks very sleek and pretty.) You should note ONE thing. You cannot go on the internet with it, unless you have a Xbox 360 Internet Adapter. But otherwise, saving up for for 4 months was SOOO worth it! I 100% say go for it! I promise you, you will NOT regret it!!! Very happy with what I got! :D <3 :3 <3 Date published: 2017-01-10 Rated 5 out of 5 by TheMegamanFan from best console Ever this is probably my most favorite system ever only one thing how many gb does this thing have?d:lol! Date published: 2016-11-27 Rated 2 out of 5 by ChrissyAddams13 from Highly dissapointed First off let me start by saying I don't know much about gaming systems because this is the first one I've purchased. Ok, so my package came in a fair amount of time I was excited to get it and was telling my boyfriend how I had been wanting an Xbox for the longest. It arrives late at night and I start to unbox it. once I've plugged everything in and popped in the game I had purchased along with it I notice it isn't allowing me to play. Come to find out there was no hardrive provided with the console. Nowhere on the page did it say it did not include a hardrive, you'd think it would just be included yeah? Well sadly it wasn't and my entire mood was ruined. I wouldn't recommend buying this unless you have the extra money to go and purchase all the extra things for it. It would just be easier to save yourself the trouble and go buy a brand new one, less dissapointment and sadness to deal with. Date published: 2015-12-02 Rated 4 out of 5 by Carley from You get what you pay for I guess When I ordered it I paid about $13 for next day shipping and of course it came 4 days later. When the box was left on my front porch it was upside down and half the tape on the bottom half was peeled off. The warranty sticker almost fell out of the box. The box didn't even say fragile...When I opened it, the power brick was the one from the white xbox, just fixed to fit this one. The AV cable came with 6 prongs, 5 of which you need plugged in for a complete picture. The power button was a little pushed it so you have to press hard for it to work. When I turned it on it was loud. It played an game when I put it in. At least the console is working but I just hope it doesn't freeze every half hour like the one I bought and returned at the store last week. Date published: 2015-08-11 Rated 2 out of 5 by howtobasicstarwarsbatman from disappointed I finally got an xbox 360 and went to the next generation of gaming when i saw Batman Arkham City. And to be honest i had a lot of fun for a long time i would play for hours on end. I also had a bunch of fun playing games like forza and halo (both are xbox exclusives) my favorite however was gears of war. but in less than 6 months the system had problems reading discs. I knew that it wasn't anything to do with disc quality they always went straight to the case after use and my fingers never came in contact with the side that was read. it also didn't even read brand new games fresh out of the plastic wrap. This is an inexcusable fault i paid for a console that was going to stop working in less than half a year. On top of the systems faultiness there are a few other issues such as how the older models don't even have an hdmi hookup. Also unless you purchase a separate batter pack and charger you will be buying your own batteries for the controller(which is an awesome controller btw). This is also inexcusable the xbox 360 main competitor the playstation 3 comes with a rechargeable controller with the necessary cable. And i don't have a problem with paying for multiplayer as long as the experience is improved which it was. but i do have a problem with having to pay to use netflix which i already pay for and i also have to pay to use youtube. fortunately they fixed this a while ago but only after i converted to using ps3 which i don't have to pay to play on. overall my experience with xbox was a fun but short one i had two xbox 360s and both broke the first had a glitch where it stopped reading discs the second got the rrod. overall i honestly wouldn't recommend an xbox 360 to any of my friends unless it is the later model.

I'm Competetive Gamer that plays 7+ hours a day all day playing GTA, 2K Crew, UFC n CoD. i've owned the White Version before this n had 3rings of death, damaged discs etc withn 3yrs. so if you're looking for a new 360 get the XB360 - Black Original trust me this Console will outlast ur Warranty lol it's that Durable. Date published: 2015-05-15 Rated 4 out of 5 by Zahl from Not Terribly Elite The Xbox 360 in and of itself is a pretty meh console. Its properties are exceptional for its era but its operating system is not so great. The hubs and friend features are a nice change but aren't really mastered here. Then again this is much better than an Xbox One. The games supported on 360 are some of the best that have ever been released but sadly Microsoft no longer holds some of those as exclusives so it's become a somewhat obsolete console...

With summer just around the corner, you might think the most popular hue would be a bright pink or coral. Instead the most saved nail polish color of 2017 thus far is a soft, neutral beige. And it seems like nude nails are having a moment: Pinterest reports that searches for these shades are up almost 800 percent. 6 Ways to Make Your Hands Look 10 Years Younger \nWe can understand why the neutral hue has become so popular. A simple search for it on Pinterest brings up a multitude of skin tones and nail shapes wearing the flattering milky color\u2014proving that just about anyone can pull it off. While it\u2019s simply chic all on it\u2019s own, it also acts as a great blank canvas for nail art. Whether it\u2019s a rose gold half moon along the cuticle or a simple dot of silver at the base of the nail, Topless and Barefoot pairs well with just about anything.

After all, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ both have the tough task to deal with large, high-res displays and they have a very powerful system chip (for this test, we have the Exynos 8895 version of the phones, we will test the Snapdragon 835 model at a later point in time), both factors that could potentially consume a lot of power. We have tested the Exynos Galaxy S8 and S8+ model To find out about the Galaxy S8 and S8+ battery life, we put them through our standard test that allows us to compare all phones on equal grounds: with the screen set to the same level (200 nits of brightness, comfortable for typical indoor use). Luckily, the Galaxy S8+ does very well in this test and even though it is not the number one battery performer, it is certainly above the average for flagships these days. Note that we have tested using the Full HD+ resolution that our phones came set to by default (1080 x 2220 pixels). Samsung Galaxy S8+ battery test result Battery life (hours) Samsung Galaxy S8+ 8h (Excellent) Samsung Galaxy S8 8h 22 min (Excellent) Samsung Galaxy S7 edge 7h 18 min (Good) Samsung Galaxy S7 6h 37 min (Average) Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9h 5 min (Excellent) Apple iPhone 7 7h 46 min (Good) LG G6 6h 20 min (Average) Google Pixel XL 7h 19 min (Good) OnePlus 3T 5h 41 min (Average) Huawei P10 7h 42 min (Good) View all The Galaxy S8 and S8+ get similar, but not equal battery life test results. The Galaxy S8+ Exynos model that we tested scored exactly 8 hours , while the more compact S8 Exynos version topped this with a score of 8 hours and 23 minutes. Interestingly, the Snapdragon model of the Galaxy S8 scored less than the Exynos version: it went 10 minutes short of 8 hours. Compare this with the 7 hours and 18 minutes that the already very good Galaxy S7 Edge scored, and you see that Samsung has managed to improve on their last year's phone. The S8 and S8+ also best the Google Pixel XL, the OnePlus 3T, but fall a bit short of the battery life on the iPhone 7 Plus. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ battery will last you through even a very busy day In a nutshell, both the Galaxy S8 with its 3,000 mAh cell, as well as the S8+ with its 3,500 mAh battery run a long time. On a separate note, we have recently noticed that more affordable phones, especially ones with the 14nm Snapdragon 625 system chip, do remarkably well in terms of battery life . In fact, we often get envy-worthy 2-day battery longevity on these phones, while the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are not quite in that territory. Still, when we speak about flagship grade devices, the Galaxy S8+ is definitely among the best out there. With a phone like this, you can be assured that you will get through a busy full day and still have juice left, even if you are a power user, and that is definitely reassuring.

The S8 is viewed as an opportunity for Samsung to demonstrate it can produce a fault-free handset, and yet, it looks as though there is a problem. This time it isn't the battery, it's the much more visible display.\nAccording the The Korea Herald , which shared the image you see below, consumers who preordered the S8 and S8 Plus in Korea have taken delivery of their new phones. But the complaints are already starting to appear regarding a reddish tint visible across the display.\n\nSamsung was quick to respond to complaints and claims this is not a display fault. The company advises S8 owners experiencing the reddish tint to adjust the display settings on the phone. However, this apparently isn't working in all cases, so Samsung is allowing an exchange to happen at service centers.\nAs to the cause of the color balance problem, the culprit is thought to be 'deep red' OLEDs. Samsung uses two subpixels in the S8's OLED display, which break down to red-green and blue-green. So as to offset the potential color balance problem of too much green, Samsung strengthened the red color. The red tint suggests they overdid it."}, {"crawled": "2017-04-19T03:57:21.000+03:00", "title": "Samsung Galaxy S8 unboxing and first look", "external_links": [], "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "dda6573a711f8a25f8aff620d6d3d9586112785f", "author": "Victor H.", "thread": {"section_title": "PhoneArena", "title": "Samsung Galaxy S8 unboxing and first look", "site_full": "www.phonearena.com", "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 521, "likes": 521}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "title_full": "Samsung Galaxy S8 unboxing and first look", "site_type": "news", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_uBcn5s23N.EYCeGhnaa9n2GfsXnKwoRrjMiSxJVlhG49Mdf6hKQj_.R24b8IrFP4Rd4EH29o1YbEjTqr9NITsBwAqZZkFen8x2LfDEmdu2A--", "uuid": "dda6573a711f8a25f8aff620d6d3d9586112785f", "participants_count": 1, "replies_count": 0, "domain_rank": 1728, "spam_score": 0.0, "country": "US", "site": "phonearena.com", "main_image": "http://i-cdn.phonearena.com/images/article/92989-image/Samsung-Galaxy-S8-unboxing-and-first-look.jpg", "site_section": "http://www.phonearena.com//feed", "published": "2017-04-18T23:00:00.000+03:00", "performance_score": 5, "site_categories": []}, "highlightText": "", "rating": null, "ord_in_thread": 0, "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "samsung"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "t-mobile"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "verizon"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "samsung galaxy s8"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "sprint"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "at&t"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_uBcn5s23N.EYCeGhnaa9n2GfsXnKwoRrjMiSxJVlhG49Mdf6hKQj_.R24b8IrFP4Rd4EH29o1YbEjTqr9NITsBwAqZZkFen8x2LfDEmdu2A--", "published": "2017-04-18T23:00:00.000+03:00", "text": "Samsung Galaxy S8 unboxing and first look Samsung Galaxy S8 unboxing and first look Posted: Tags : T-Mobile - T-Mobile + AT&T - AT&T + Verizon - Verizon + Sprint - Sprint + Samsung - Samsung + Android - Android + The Samsung Galaxy S8 has dropped by to say hello and - first things first - it's time for an unboxing. The Galaxy S8 ships in a stylish all-black box with nothing, but the letters 'S8' in luscious, glossy blue at the front. Open the box and inside we find one of the most comprehensive and richest sets of mobile gear available. No wonder, this is one truly premium flagship (with a truly premium price). The first thing that you see when you open the box of the Galaxy S8 is the phone itself. We have the Midnight Black version and it looks stunning, with a thin, elegant profile and a much taller and narrower body and display. It's surprising how its 5.8-inch display in this taller body results in a phone that is not as wide as traditional phablets, and is still easy to hold in one hand and to use. We take the foil off and start up the phone, but while we wait, let's take a look at what is inside the box... Pair of AKG ear-buds with 2 additional silicon pads (L and M size) Samsung 'Adaptive Fast Charging' wall charger (9V at 1.67A, or 5V at 2A) USB-C to USB-A cable SIM ejector tool User manuals A cool new detail with the Galaxy S8 is that everything inside the box is black: you have a black wall charger, black cables, even black adapters (it's a glossy black, not matte, in case you are wondering). This is a change from earlier Samsung devices where all these accessories were white. Of course, the coolest new accessory in the Galaxy S8 box is the pair of AKG ear buds, a much higher quality set of headphones than the ones that usually come with phones. You get two additional rubber silicone pads with a large and a smaller size to better fit your ear. The buds have a weird, alien-like form and fit comfortably in the ear, and you also have a controller on the chord with a mic. We will take a separate look at these headphones in a separate post, but we're definitely happy to find them in the box. Samsung also include a handy USB-C to traditional USB-A adapter that is useful if you want to transfer data from a flash drive to your phone, and you get a microUSB to USB-C adapter that ensures that you can use an older microUSB cable or an older power bank with a microUSB cable. The 'Adaptive Fast Charging' wall brick is conveniently small and powerful. It starts by delivering 15 watts of power to your phone (9V at 1.67A), and towards the end of the charge switches to a 10-watt output (5V at 2A). Using this charger you will be able to top up your battery quicker than with a regular charger. The rest is manuals and other technical literature that you probably won't even open, but for what it is the Galaxy S8 is a very comprehensive package and comes with all the necessary accessories that we can think of. Great job, Samsung.
