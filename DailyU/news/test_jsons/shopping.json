How do we deal with the continued lynching of Muslims by gau rakshaks? \nIn the 17 months since Mohammed Akhlaq was beaten to death in UP on suspicion of having cooked beef, eight Muslim men have been killed, two Muslim women raped, and almost 40 persons, including two women and seven non-Muslims, assaulted by gau rakshaks. \nOne of the eight victims, 22-year-old Minhaj Ansari, died in police custody in Jharkhand, after his arrest over a WhatsApp message on beef. \nThat's a rate of over two lynchings a month. \nOn Wikipedia, the topic 'Lynching in the US' informs us that an average of five lynchings a month took place there over a 73-year period. \nIt is time now to create a similar topic for India, with advisories for tourists on areas with the most lynchings, and a warning that if they must visit these beautiful locales, eating meat should be strictly avoided. \nOne reality we have to face is that the State will not stop such lynchings. The silence of The Leader has once again been deafening. Ironically, he was busy welcoming Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh's prime minister, when a 55-year-old dairy farmer Pehlu Khan's lynching was playing out on our television screens and being debated in Parliament. \nThe smuggling of our cattle to Bangladesh has long been an irritant for the ruling party. One of the first things Home Minister Rajnath Singh did was urge the Border Security Force to crack down so hard on cattle smugglers that Bangladeshis would have to give up beef! The Bangladeshi PM must surely have heard that remark. What would she have thought about Pehlu Khan\u2019s lynching? If nothing else, it must have reassured her that her country was not alone in letting violent fanatics run amok against minorities. \nIn Pakistan, there's open rejoicing that finally, their founder's Two-Nation theory is being proved right in India. \nThat's just not true. Yet, can we who reject that poisonous theory convince the Pakistanis otherwise? \nDo the powers that be consider these lynchings wrong? \nWhen pushed by a media outcry, the police arrest a few gau rakshaks, but it is obvious that for them, the survivors of such attacks are the real offenders. The filing of charges against Pehlu Khan's companions, who were also attacked, follow a pattern that began in October 2015, in Congress-ruled Himachal Pradesh. For the police, whoever is in power, Hindutva rules, and no Congress state government has done anything to make the police feel otherwise. \nFive Muslims were attacked in Himachal Pradesh's Lavasa village, Sirmaur district, in October 2015, for ferrying cows; of them, 20-year-old Noman died. The police arrested the Muslims and a few assailants, but the latter quickly got bail. \nSimilarly, an FIR was lodged against Mohammed Akhlaq's family members when the Samajwadi Party ruled UP, though this happened under court orders. \nToday, the lower courts, the government and the police, treat Muslims dealing with cows, be they dairy farmers or cattle traders, as offenders. Meat-eating Muslims are similarly treated because today, the BJP has defined all meat eaten by Muslims as beef. \nThis was demonstrated not only in Akhlaq's case, but also in the recent raid on a Jaipur restaurant where workers were thrashed for discarding chicken bones near a garbage bin where a cow was standing. Given these ground realities, what should the rest of us do? By 'us' is meant those repelled by this kind of murderous religious zeal. This zeal repels us as human beings; but surely it also repels us as Hindus. \nThese public killings of unarmed Muslims and the whipping of unarmed Dalits are being done in the name of Hindu belief in the sanctity of the cow. \nThe cow is sacred to many of us, but these killings are definitely not part of the Hinduism we know and practise. Yes, physical ill-treatment of Dalits is part of some Hindu texts, but today, few Hindus would justify it. \nSince March 12, 1993, when the first major act of terror was executed in the country by a group of angry Muslims in Mumbai, we have been asking Muslims to speak out against the terrorist acts of a few of their co-religionists. \nA similar demand was made a decade earlier from Sikhs, because sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and his followers were creating mayhem in Punjab. Indeed, the late Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray humiliated Mumbai's Sikh leaders at a press conference on this very demand. \nBut Hindu intellectuals have always condemned the likes of Thackeray, Pravin Togadia, and RSS/BJP leaders, including ex-deputy PM L K Advani and current PM Narendra Modi. That's as it should be -- wherever one community is in an overwhelming majority, its intellectuals act as conscience keepers when minorities are attacked. \nBut the climate of violent intolerance brought in by the new government at the Centre must force even ordinary Hindus to speak up against the way their religion is being projected by the ruling party. 'Not my Hinduism' should become our slogan, and we should be marching on the streets to proclaim it. \nNot only to reassure non-Hindus that the Hindu majority regards them as equal citizens -- an assurance which is urgently necessary -- but also to reassure ourselves that the religion we practise is not a murderous one. \nLike Muslims are being told to reclaim Islam from ISIS, Hindus must now reclaim Hinduism from the version being projected today. \nThose who led us through Independence realised the damage done by the Hindu caste system and the need to compensate, hence they included reservations in the Constitution. \nBut those who govern us today show no signs of acknowledging the crimes being committed in the name of Hinduism by their followers. Instead, there's unabashed approval of this savagery. \nThis makes it all the more important for ordinary Hindus to proclaim their disapproval of this terror, even to express regret to those attacked in the name of Hinduism. \nThere is a very recent precedent for this: After Coach S-6 of the Sabarmati Express was burnt at Godhra on February 27, 2002, the religious head of Godhra's Muslims, Maulana Umerji, publicly apologised for this act by members of his community. \nWhy should only minorities have to bear this burden of guilt for the misdeeds of their co-religionists? The majority bears much more responsibility. What can those bearing the brunt of the attacks do? \nAfter Una, Dalits in Gujarat abandoned dead cows on the streets, refusing to skin them. Can Muslims give up anything to do with cows, even rearing them? That would be difficult, given that often their livelihood depends on them. But it might just be worth the suffering. \nBecause the ultimate sufferer of the gau rakshak violence and the rapidly spreading bans on meat eating is the farmer, for whom cattle, be it cows/bulls, become a burden after a certain age. A majority of our farmers are Hindus. Let them protest. \nAs business goes down in cattle fairs, let those who can no longer find buyers for their cows protest. There have been reports from across the country of Hindu cattle traders and farmers being angry with the drop in their business and the risks involved. \nIn Karnataka, a BJP worker ferrying cows was killed by gau rakshaks last year, and many Hindu traders have reported attacks on them. Let them pressurise their governments; after all, the BJP has made it clear in its electoral campaigns and strategies that it is a party only of and for Hindus. That, however, may be an impractical solution. An immediate solution to end the impunity with which gau rakshaks attack their prey, in daylight and in full view of passersby, is to petition the courts. \nA public interest ligitation filed by Congressman Tehseen Poonawala asking for a ban on gau rakshaks is currently being heard by the Supreme Court. But bans work only when the State wants them to. \nInstead, why can't rights activists -- most of them happen to be Hindu -- ask that the court set up a mechanism to monitor the action taken after attacks by gau rakshaks? \nA list of such assaults, the inadequate response of the police, justifications of these assaults by those in power, and the effect of these assaults on the lives of the survivors can be presented to the court in support of such a demand. \nIf there can be an National Investigation Agency to deal exclusively with terrorist acts, why can't courts set up Special Investigative Teams to monitor gAU rakshak terror? \nDO READ the features in the RELATED LINKS below... \nIMAGE: Gau rakshaks on the prowl to catch alleged smugglers.

In fact, it has nothing to do with beauty. The latest craze to sweep the industry is all about saving the earth: beauty companies are finally hopping aboard the green train and trying to make their product packaging more sustainable. For just about as long as there\u2019s been a commercial market for beauty products, those products have been stored and sold in elaborate plastic packaging. Think about it: when you come home with a haul from Sephora , you typically have to peel off layers of cellophane and plastic just to get to the box, which is made up of two-to-three parts. Then, after you\u2019ve used every last drop, you throw the mascara tube or night cream jar right into the trash. Little of the plastic used to house makeup and skincare products is recyclable, and most of it ends up in landfills. There, it will sit for years and take nearly 1,000 years to decompose. (And noo, I\u2019m not exaggerating .) It\u2019s a grim picture. But the fact is plastic packaging makes up an enormous percentage of the trash that ends up in landfills, or elsewhere, and the the beauty industry has historically been a significant contributor. Some estimates say personal care and beauty products account for a third of all landfill waste . Beauty companies have tried to mitigate their impact on the environment for years. In 2010, a handful of companies helped make eco-friendly packaging a trend . Yet as many do, the trend passed, and overall the beauty industry has still struggled to become truly eco-friendly. However, it\u2019s not simply that beauty companies don\u2019t care enough to help the pollution crisis: it\u2019s largely due to the fact that beauty products have unique packaging needs that make sourcing earth-friendly materials a serious challenge. What makes packaging sustainable? Before you can understand these challenges, it\u2019s important to comprehend what it really means for packaging to be \u201csustainable\u201d in the first place. There\u2019s actually no strict definition or criteria , and there are myriad earth-friendly factors that can make a product somewhat more sustainable than average. What a product\u2019s packaging is made of is the most obvious factor. Whether a can of hairspray or tube of lipstick is made from renewable, recycled, or biodegradable materials (or if it is itself recyclable) can easily affect how \u201cgreen\u201d the packaging is. The simple shape of a product can also make it more environmentally friendly, too. If packaging is designed so that when packed in a box, there is no leftover space, it is better for the environment because it\u2019s more efficient. That\u2019s why, for example, Kevin Murphy uses square packaging. \u201cSomething as simple as using a square shape has a huge environmental benefit,\u201d founder Kevin Murphy explained, \u201csince tightly-packed, boxy bottles use up to 40 percent less resin than standard round packaging and take up less shipping space and packing materials when it leaves our LEED certified distribution facility.\u201d More efficiently packed goods ultimately means less gas will be needed to transfer a shipment. For this same reason, lighter packaging is often more sustainable as well. Other green factors include how much energy it takes to manufacture the packaging, whether any toxic materials are included, and what impact the manufacturing has on the planet. Why do beauty brands have trouble going green? Because sustainability is so dynamic, there are lots of small things companies can do to make their packaging more earth-friendly. Nevertheless, the beauty industry finds itself in particularly tough spot. Though it\u2019s easy to take for granted, many beauty products are delicate, and packaging them properly \u2014 even without taking the pollution into account \u2014 is no easy feat. Combined with the fact that selling any product en masse comes with certain packaging rules, it makes sense why the beauty industry has struggled to become sustainable. One of these challenges has to do with retail, or selling a product at stores like Sephora and CVS . Retailers often put restrictions on package sizing to help maximize shelf space in a store (which makes sense: if they can fit more products on the shelves, they can easily sell more). If a brand wants to sell their product at one of these locations, they have to follow the store\u2019s guidelines when designing their packaging. Another consideration involves the beauty products themselves. Though we don\u2019t often think of them this way, beauty products are a bit like food. That is, they can go bad (yes, you need to throw away that year-old mascara ). That deterioration process goes much faster if a product is not stored correctly. The color, odor, and shelf life of a product are all affected by packaging, and many products need air-tight packaging to stay in tact. Many skincare ingredients are finicky (a notorious example is vitamin C ). When not properly packaged, the nutritive ingredients that promise to keep you ageless can be destabilized and rendered useless. In other words, brands trying to make sustainable beauty packaging can\u2019t simply dump their products into recyclable bottles. They have to consider how their products will be affected. Of course, as with any business consideration, cost plays a huge factor as well. \u201cCheap plastics are exactly that: inexpensive, mass produced and wasteful,\u201d says Lori Leib, the creative director at Bodyography Professional Cosmetics , a company that recently overhauled its products to use half as much plastic and incorporate more recyclable cardboard. \u201cThey do not use good quality materials therefore they are able to make the cost of goods next to nothing,\u201d she says. \u201cSustainable packaging goes through a process that can make the packaging more costly, however the plants and labs that manufacture these goods use environmentally friendly water and electricity systems as well as recycle all goods. One lab we use to manufacture our skincare went totally green a few years ago, slightly raising our cost of goods, but as a conscious brand we added this to our budget.\u201d Hannah Choi/ Allure Why now? With all these factors, getting the entire beauty industry to take on the sustainable challenge seems a nearly impossible task. While brands like Tata Harper , Aveda, Lush , and Juice Beauty have been committed to sustainability for years, in 2017 even more big name brands are stepping up to the plate. Dior recently launched a line of skincare called Hydra Life, and its packaging is \u201c designed to remove any unnecessary elements (such as the leaflet, corrugated card and cellophane), with a reduced glass weight and inks predominantly of natural origin.\u201d Meanwhile Garnier, whose packaging is now made from 50 percent post-recycled materials, has teamed up with recycling company TerraCycle, DoSomething.org, and Remi Cruz to launch a campaign to increase awareness about beauty product recycling (see video below). Why now? There are a number of reasons, but a big reason is that in 2017, consumers care more than ever about the effect the consumption is having on the planet. \u201cOver the years we have become aware that overpopulation and industrialization have created harmful changes on all these elements we depend on,\u201d says Murphy. \u201cWe, as industrialized cultures have just recently become aware of this imbalance and the negative effects it has on the environment based on the dramatic changes we see in our world\u2019s climate and in nature.\u201d Bodyography\u2019s Lori Leib adds, \u201cJust like we live our lives more clean, clothing, products and all goods follow suit.\u201d \u201cWhy spend money to decrease your use of gas or electricity while simultaneously purchasing products that are wasteful?\u201d she says. \u201cConsumers are more aware of what goes into their products these days both ingredient wise and packaging, claiming that your brand uses eco-friendly packaging is both ethical and a talking sales point.\u201d Continue to read up on the state of green beauty, below:", "uuid": "13c7453ef5bb727d66c4bb2e90bee79f10162a39", "thread": {"title": "Why Eco-Friendly Beauty Packaging is on the Rise in 2017", "performance_score": 7, "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 709, "shares": 709}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 18}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "published": "2017-04-11T01:50:26.469+03:00", "main_image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/58ebededfcca3040ee1776c0/master/pass/eco-friendly-packaging.jpg", "site_full": "www.allure.com", "uuid": "13c7453ef5bb727d66c4bb2e90bee79f10162a39", "site_section": "http://www.allure.com/services/rss/feeds/video.xml", "section_title": "Allure", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "title_full": "Why Eco-Friendly Beauty Packaging is on the Rise in 2017", "domain_rank": 7365, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8e.8tiVFFD4dtrwKiTAza9USRNd_qQXRj7w_sjkLFmuelxOv8JDexYYFkmEtnfXJmyENeDMlbpioEZOOFdyyup", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "site": "allure.com"}, "author": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [{"name": "hannah choi", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "lori leib", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "kevin murphy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "remi cruz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "murphy", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "garnier", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "tata harper", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bodyography", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "sephora", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "aveda", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bodyography professional cosmetics", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "cvs", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "highlightText": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8e.8tiVFFD4dtrwKiTAza9USRNd_qQXRj7w_sjkLFmuelxOv8JDexYYFkmEtnfXJmyENeDMlbpioEZOOFdyyup", "crawled": "2017-04-11T01:50:26.469+03:00"}, {"title": "10 Apps Every Lazy Person Needs - Slideshow from PCMag.com", "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-10T03:30:17.671+03:00", "text": "10 Apps Every Lazy Person Needs 10 Apps Every Lazy Person Needs Click To View Slideshow \u00bb Transform yourself into an immobile lump of flesh that has forgotten how to do basic tasks. \nIt's the year 2017, and we're feeling a little cheated.

Pick up your phone and let's slack off to the future. \n( Stephanie Mlot contributed to this story. ) ", "uuid": "4cf6a82442f013a513ab2e953545a7d7793a0abc", "thread": {"title": "10 Apps Every Lazy Person Needs - Slideshow from PCMag.com", "performance_score": 7, "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 746, "shares": 746}, "gplus": {"shares": 10}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 99}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 20}}, "spam_score": 0.023, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "published": "2017-04-10T03:30:17.671+03:00", "main_image": "https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/538359-apps-for-lazy-people.jpg?thumb=y&width=810&height=456", "site_full": "www.pcmag.com", "uuid": "4cf6a82442f013a513ab2e953545a7d7793a0abc", "site_section": "", "section_title": "", "site_categories": ["news", "shopping", "tech"], "title_full": "10 Apps Every Lazy Person Needs - Slideshow from PCMag.com", "domain_rank": 793, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_EldM0hkfg7y710hjQqoBV2Xs_176oXpJxBtJHJlEkiqQLPO2GY5Z43Z2HQs_C2._9VSr_6ZNsZFdsb9J59m7BXSX6.6mT4ak-", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "site": "pcmag.com"}, "author": "K.

HMD official explains how Android will help Nokia return to former glory Posted: Tags : Nokia - Nokia + Android - Android + \nThe Nokia 6 in Arte Black Simplicity, ease of use, build quality. These were some of the main attributes that made Nokia phones so popular in the pre-iPhone era. Although the Finnish firm went through some very tough times in the past 10 years, its recent Android revival through HMD Global has undoubtedly delighted fans of the brand across the globe. As you may know, HMD Global secured the rights to produce and sell Nokia-branded handsets for the next 10 years, and according to one official from the company, a bright future lies ahead for the new Android-powered Nokia smartphones.Speaking to Gulf News, HMD Global\u2019s vice president for the Middle East and North Africa Per Ekman promised that the latest handsets will retain the same brand qualities which consumers loved in older Nokia products, while also giving details on how a new strategic partnership with Google will help propel the company back to its former glory: Most of the smartphones in the market do not have the Android OS in the way it should be. Vendors are adding a skin on top of the OS. Consumers have the right to have the latest version of the OS and we will be pushing the latest version and the patches as soon as it is available from Google ... We and Google will jointly enhance the Nokia brand to put the right kind of inputs into the phone, including Google Assistant HMD has been very keen on emphasizing that the Nokia 3 , Nokia 5 , and Nokia 6 will run the most clean, unaltered version of Android possible. This was officially announced back at MWC, where the company surprised everyone by stating that the three handsets will roll out with Android 7.1.1 out of the box, along with monthly security updates, and all of the latest software features from Google. This gives the trio a major advantage over its competitors, as the number of Android phones that run the latest version of the OS is extremely small (less than 1% of Android devices are on Nougat 7.1). According to Ekman, the results that HMD achieved with this year's January launch of the Nokia 6 in China are more than promising. Labeling the East Asian country as \"the toughest market\", he stated that more than one million units were sold in pre-registration within 23 seconds of the announcement. The handset will have a global launch alongside three other Nokia models, and although Ekman did not share any information about an exact release date, industry experts predict that the new phones will hit the shelves at the end of May or in early June.

Now, she has found herself on the receiving end of conservative criticism: after declaring herself \u201cpro-choice\u201d during an appearance on The View , she was suspended from Glenn Beck\u2019s right-wing media network The Blaze. Lahren is now suing Glenn Beck and The Blaze for wrongful termination, claiming they tried to fire her for her stance on abortion. Using the law in a way that was made possible by feminists before her, Lahren is positioning herself as the female victim of male oppression. You May Also Like Lifestyle Caitlyn Jenner Opens Up About Gender Affirmation Surgery in Her New Memoir Some feminists have defended her. They are wrong to do so. \"I\u2019m for limited government, so stay out of my guns, and you can stay out of my body as well,\" Lahren said during her appearance on The View . Mind you, this is the same woman who mocked women\u2019s marches and strikes as part of a \" victimhood narrative ,\" and who decried modern feminism as \"man-bashing\" and about \"free birth control.\" She supported Donald Trump, a man who bragged about sexual assault, for president, denouncing Republicans who distanced themselves from him rather than a man who violated women. Not only that, but Lahren has promoted and profited off of overt and unapologetic racism. She has called Black Lives Matter the equivalent of the KKK and demanded that President Obama bomb the Middle East to \"put the fear of God in their desert.\" She has criticized the Democratic Party for supporting free birth control, because she \" can take care of herself \". Apparently, Lahren supports reproductive rights, but only for herself. She supports abortion, but not any effort to extend access to those who are denied it. She supports bodily autonomy, but only for those who are able to afford to access it on their own. This isn\u2019t feminism. It\u2019s blatant hypocrisy and callous selfishness. Since 2010, over 300 abortion restrictions have been enacted in states across the country. Some 90% of U.S. counties have no clinics providing abortions, and according to the Guttmacher Institute, the majority of reproductive-age U.S. women live in states that are hostile to reproductive rights. Limits on abortion access are hitting low-income women and women of color , for whom barriers of distance and cost may be insurmountable, especially hard. This is a direct result of the harmful and oppressive policies put forth by Republicans in state legislatures, far-right Republicans that Tomi Lahren herself has lionized and supported in front of huge audiences. Media personalities like Lahren aren\u2019t just supportive of the erosion of abortion rights; they are complicit in it. They share responsibility. Stating your support for legal abortion is good and important, but it means little if you refuse to support any other fundamental aspect of reproductive justice. It means even less if you actively work against any systemic or structural support for safe and accessible abortion for all. Tomi Lahren is perfectly content to tell the world to \"stay out of my body\" while working to deny bodily autonomy for people of color, Muslims, and anyone who isn\u2019t a wealthy white woman like her. In being fired for stating her support for legal abortion, Lahren has become a victim of the punitive, misogynist worldview from which she previously benefited. The real victimhood narrative comes from believing that the only rights that matter are yours. #", "uuid": "096dd7ed2baaf998f803cbf2d2554d51dcaf739b", "thread": {"title": "Tomi Lahren May Be Pro-Choice, But She Doesn't Deserve Your Pity", "performance_score": 6, "social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 637, "shares": 637}, "gplus": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "spam_score": 0.0, "site_type": "news", "country": "US", "published": "2017-04-11T01:50:24.089+03:00", "main_image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/58ebea66e45ed465b769cae4/master/pass/tomi-lahren.jpg", "site_full": "www.allure.com", "uuid": "096dd7ed2baaf998f803cbf2d2554d51dcaf739b", "site_section": "http://www.allure.com/services/rss/feeds/video.xml", "section_title": "Allure", "site_categories": ["shopping"], "title_full": "Tomi Lahren May Be Pro-Choice, But She Doesn't Deserve Your Pity", "domain_rank": 7365, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8e.8tiVFFD4dtrwKiTAza9fZErvsldMioZuyNDgIL4803xF1N717CkrIr8E_3TtA9UjbjBrctIgfeYulwwTg_g59wPUOtc3V4-", "participants_count": 0, "replies_count": 0, "site": "allure.com"}, "author": "", "external_links": [], "entities": {"locations": [{"name": "u.s.", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "middle east", "sentiment": "none"}], "persons": [{"name": "tomi lahren", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "caitlyn jenner", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "donald trump", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lahren", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "glenn beck", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "obama", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "kkk", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "guttmacher institute", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "democratic party", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "rating": null, "highlightText": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8e.8tiVFFD4dtrwKiTAza9fZErvsldMioZuyNDgIL4803xF1N717CkrIr8E_3TtA9UjbjBrctIgfeYulwwTg_g59wPUOtc3V4-", "crawled": "2017-04-11T01:50:24.089+03:00"}, {"title": "A Reddit User Used Too Faced Born This Way Foundation to Cover Up Her Sunburn", "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-11T01:50:41.307+03:00", "text": "April 10, 2017 Getty Images Too Faced is known and loved in the beauty community for its holographic lip products (ahem, Unicorn Tears ), peachy palettes , and deliciously named products (Chocolate Brow-nie brow pencils, anyone?).

But it should be noted that no matter how well a foundation conceals sun damage, as tryingwithmarkers proved, it's actually not the first step you should take to help soothe sunburnt skin. As New York City-based dermatologist Debra Jaliman suggests, if you have a sunburn, your first concern should be treating said damage \u2014 not concealing it. \"It's important to treat the inflammation from the sunburn first,\" she says. Her top treatment tip? Slathering on the OG of sun-soothing treatments: aloe vera, for its anti-inflammatory properties. But if you're strapped for resources, Jaliman also recommends a few DIY treatments, including baking soda mixed with water. \"The mix has has a pH level of 5.5 just as your skin, which means it would balance the pH of burned skin,\" she says. \"You can use a milk compress or apply plain full fat yogurt along the area.\" Suffice it to say, there are a number of expert-approved sunburn ailments out there \u2014 and not one of them involves a full face of foundation.

That's only two days after pre-orders initially opened. That's a massive 150,000 more than the Note7 before it, and whooping 5.5 times more than the Galaxy S7 .This is probably thanks to the high potential demand of the phone, as retail stores have received many pre-orders as well. Additionally, the country's three big carriers have launched massive marketing campaigns alongside Samsung, boosting pre-orders even further.What must be kept in mind here is that, although the Galaxy S8 performs pretty well in South Korea, that doesn't guarantee the same reception in Western markets.

Sadly, The Hollywood Reporter brings word that the late comedian Don Rickles, who passed away at the age of 90 this past Thursday , had not yet recorded his lines for the role of Mr. Potato Head, which he has voiced since the first film in 1995. Toy Story 4 is reportedly in the middle of rewrites and Rickles had yet to be called in. \nToy Story 4 will be a love story with Woody and Bo Peep, and will pick up where Toy Story 3 left off, when Woody, Buzz Lightyear and the rest of the series\u2019 toy chest of characters were handed down to a little girl named Bonnie. That\u2019s all we know about the story so far, though more could be revealed at this July\u2019s D23 Expo in Anaheim, California. It\u2019s certainly possible that earlier takes of Rickles voice could be used for the role. Just this past Friday, it was reported that Carrie Fisher\u2019s brother Todd Fisher and her daughter Billie Lourd had given permission for earlier footage to be used for the role of Princess Leia in Star Wars: Episode IX . \nToy Story 4 stars Tim Allen, Tom Hanks, Annie Potts, Patricia Arquette and Joan Cusack. The film was written by Rashida Jones and Will McCormack who both wrote and starred in Celeste and Jesse Forever . They\u2019re working from a story idea by Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter, and Lee Unkrich. It\u2019s directed by Lasseter and Josh Cooley. Are you guys excited for Toy Story 4 ?

Think $300 less, or more! We are talking about OnePlus and the upcoming OnePlus 5. Skipping a number to prevent the bad fortune the Chinese associate with 4, the handset is rumored to be spec'd to the nines and comparatively design-conscious. Here are 5 things about the OnePlus 5 that give it true \"flagship killer\" potential \u2013 at least figuratively. For its unbeatable performance-to-ratio advantage in Western markets, let's remember that OnePlus can't pull off Samsung's billion dollar marketing to get comparable sales volume, doesn't partner with carriers, and is going to remain an \"underdog\" for the foreseeable future.But these are technicalities. Let us focus on the great potential at hand \u2013 even if it's all rumors at this point! 1. A new design with slim bezels and no Home button, ready to tackle Samsung's You may have thought OnePlus needs to freshen it up for the follow-up to the rather basic-looking OP 2 and OP 3. Apparently, so does the company! Leaks from China suggest very thin side bezels, or possibly an \"all-screen\" type design as a major change coming to the OnePlus 5. What's more, OP is supposedly doing away with the physical home button, too, and moving the fingerprint scanner to the back panel \u2013 hopefully in a more sensible place than Samsung's camera-smudging placement. 1. OnePlus 5 design concept 2. OnePlus 5 design concept 3. OnePlus 5 design concept While we doubt OnePlus has the resources to make a phone quite as sleek and meticulous as the Galaxy S8 right now, it can certainly generate a looker that's on par with the Xiaomi Mi Mix or another eye-grabbing model. Which would be a huge advantage, combined with other strong sides the OP5 is rumored to have! Such as... 2. More RAM memory than any other smartphone in 2017 Look, we all know RAM isn't the be-all, end-all of smartphone performance. But the OnePlus 5 is rumored to feature a whopping 8GB of the stuff, and OP knows darn well how to sell the extra memory put in its handsets. The OnePlus 3 is still a big deal for having 6GB RAM anywhere in the world. The few 6GB handsets today are China-exclusives.Additional RAM might not give them any considerable speed advantages, but it sure makes a smartphone appear more powerful and cutting-edge! And with 8GB of RAM, the OnePlus will easily make the Galaxy S8 , which hovers between 4GB and 6GB in different markets, seem a tad underpowered.Said excess of RAM is expected to be packaged with the Snapdragon 835 processor and a 2K-resolution display (a first for OnePlus), evening out the playing field between the \"flagship\" and its killer-candidate in these regards. 3. A supercharged camera with possible dual-lens setup OnePlus may be bulletproofing the OP5's spec sheet to the largest extent possible at the time of launch. This includes rumors of a 23MP rear camera and 16MP front camera. Chances are the rear cam will be a dual-lens module with optical image stabilization, but alas, we haven't been clued in to any other goodies that may be in store.Single or dual-lens, a 23MP camera is almost twice as generous as what Samsung offers with the Galaxy S8's 12MP camera in terms of raw megapixel count. But it's perfectly possible that the S8 will end up beating the OnePlus 5 \u2013 and probably most new Android phones \u2013 in terms of photo quality. \nOnePlus 5 design concept OnePlus may have the bigger sensor, but as a smaller company, it may not have what it takes to make the absolute most out of it. With that said, OP always shipped decent cameras, and we expect adequate shots from the upcoming OnePlus 5. 4. Better battery life than most Rumored to stand at between 3500mAh to 4000mAh, the OnePlus 5's large battery capacity and its power-efficient Snapdragon 835 chipset will probably make for excellent battery life, surpassing that of the Galaxy S8 and, possibly, the Galaxy S8+'. They ship with 3000mAh and 3500mAh units, respectively, and are rated around the same as their predecessors, the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge . The line is clear for OnePlus to come up with one of the longest-lasting Android smartphones this year... if it really wants to. 5. A price that's hard to resist! The price is going to be the biggest kicker. Word is, OnePlus is going to sell all the aforementioned goodness for less than $500! This is very affordable for a handset this up-to-date, easily up to $300-$350 less than what any competitor on the Western market has to offer.Unfortunately, OnePlus doesn't have the advantage of working with carriers anywhere in Europe or the US, and warranty or customer support may be spotty, depending on where you purchase from. Moreover, OnePlus has trouble keeping its aging models up to date \u2013 the OP2 and OnePlus X are yet to receive Nougat updates, and no one at the company's up to explain why. Well, we know why \u2013 it's a small company doing small company things! \nOnePlus 5 design concept There's still very little to lose from purchasing a handset like the OP5 unlocked, so unless it ships with some deadly flaws, the new OnePlus could be the phone to beat in price-to-performance ratio this year. OP's product quality and sales get better with each year , so we are generally optimistic about its latest effort.

We've been hearing rumors of its newest flagship, the Mi 6, for quite some time now, but a recent string of posts on Xiaomi's official page on Chinese social networking site Weibo suggests the device will be unveiled tomorrow, April 11. Starting April 6, Xiaomi has been publishing daily posts dedicated to each of its Mi flagships on its Weibo page, and today it has posted the last of them, the one for the Mi 5. While this isn't an outright confirmation that the Mi 6 will be announced tomorrow, the timing is weirdly coincidental with a press conference that will be held tomorrow. Moreover, Xiaomi has apparently sent a WeChat message to its fans saying they should expect something tomorrow at noon, further confirming there is a big reveal coming up. \nA purported photo of the Mi 6's back panel, showing off its dual camera While it may not be as leaky as the Samsung Galaxy S8 , we still know quite a lot about the Mi 6. Its processor will most likely be Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835, though we have also heard rumors of a 821 version as well. The rear camera of the device is said to be a 12 MP dual-camera module with Sony's IMX 386 sensor, while the front will be a regular 8 MP shooter with IMX 268. There will also apparently be two options memory-wise: a 4GB RAM + 64GB internal memory one and another with a 6 GB + 128 GB combo. The screen is said to sport a 5.2-inch panel, though there's also apparently two versions of that as well: one will have a Quad HD resolution, while the other will top at Full HD instead. It's not entirely clear whether there will be just two versions of the device, or if Xiaomi will be playing mix-and-match with the specs, but we surely won't have to wait for long to see. The phone is said to also run Android 7.1.1 and will reportedly be IP68-certified. The press conference is set for noon Hong Kong time on April 11, which translates to midnight Eastern Time. We'll make sure to keep you updated if the Mi 6 really does get unveiled tomorrow, though we're almost certain it will.

For the past few weeks, the online mega star who basically invented the concept of the beauty blogger has teased the second coming of her eponymous makeup line, Em Cosmetics. She even threw a launch party in Los Angeles last week to give her YouTube community a chance to preview the products before anyone else. And while the collection officially becomes available on April 17th, Phan gave us the low-down on the launch when she stopped by the office for an exclusive interview (and a tour of our beauty closet). This time around she's doing everything on her own terms. For starters, the hundreds of product SKUs from last time has been whittled down to just two well-edited, extremely well thought out products: A collection of lip creams and liquid liners. (Although Phan promises there are more products in the works.) \"When I took this brand back, I wanted to keep it more timeless and elegant,\" says Phan. \"I could have done the more trendy things like the highlighters and stuff, but then I was like, No, I want to focus on the things that I wear all the time and that my viewers want to wear.\" You May Also Like Makeup 5 Ways to Use a Lighter With Your Makeup And one of the things Phan can't go without is liner, which is why she's launching two liquid formulas, one with an angled tip and one with a tip that's tapered and pointy. \"The pointed tip is inspired by comic book pens that allow you to create thin, dynamic lines with an ease,\" explains Phan, while the angled liner is based on old calligraphy pens. Called the Illustrative Eyeliner, both will retail for $15. Hannah Choi/ Allure As for her second product \u2014 the Infinite Lip Clouds \u2014 they might look like the matte liquid lipsticks that everyone's obsessed with these days, but in this case, looks are deceiving. \"These are like the antithesis of liquid lipsticks,\" she says of her lip creams. \"These are more buildable and lived in, so at the end of the day you're left with a nice stain because they're not drying in any way.\" The impetus for the product came from requests she received YouTube community who wanted something with the staying power and opacity of a liquid lipstick, but that wasn't matte and, most importantly, wouldn't feel like shrink wrap on their lips. And Phan formulated her lip creams with comfort in mind, using a \"hi-tech nylon fabric\" that's flexible, allowing it to move and stretch as you move and stretch your mouth. And while many people use liquid lipsticks to overdraw their lips, these are meant to stay within the lines. \"I tell people to follow their natural lip line when using this product,\" she says. \"It's my way of telling people it's nice to work with what they have.\" The lip creams, which retail for $16, come in eight shades, all of them inspired by the oil paintings Phan saw on a trip to Amsterdam. \"I was so inspired by all the vividly-colored paintings I saw there. So we took some of the best oil paints on the market and mimicked the shades,\" she explained. \"And we've been inclusive of all undertones, meaning if you're warm, cool, or neutral you can wear these shades, which is something we tested with our muses, the people who star in the campaign for the products.\" Hannah Choi/ Allure With the aid of a graphic designer, Phan helped design the geometric logo and the packaging, which looks incredibly chic for the under $20 price point. \"When I was constructing everything, I made sure we had the best of the best,\" says Phan. \"For example, when it comes to the lip creams, this is the best doe-foot applicator on the market, we didn't just stick with a stock piece.\" And while very little resembles the original Em line , Phan did stick with the black-and-white outer packaging. \"It is so hard to make a brand from scratch, but then to redo it is even harder because of the expectations that people have, and the fact that you have to revamp it but still keep elements from the old.\" Hence the similar color scheme of the boxes. The revamped Em Cosmetics is certainly a reflection of Phan's personal beauty evolution. Surprisingly, she no longer wears eye shadow on a regular basis (it began to cause irritation on her lids) and she's now completely foundation free, using only concealer to spot treat blemishes. \"I don't even cover up my under eye circles,\" she says, \"I think it looks cooler and more real.\" Additionally, she's noticed a huge improvement in her skin since dropping foundation cold turkey, which was one of her hopes when making the decision to cut the product out of her beauty routine; that, and to embrace a more natural look in general. \"When I first stopped wearing it, my skin got really bad and I experienced a lot of breakouts,\" she says. \"But after a while it finally balanced out and now I don't even have to wear a ton of concealer.\" But her evolution goes beyond just the makeup she does and doesn't wear. Phan's perspective on beauty in general has shifted since she started out. \"When I was a teenager, makeup was a form of confidence; I felt like I needed makeup to feel beautiful. Then in my twenties, makeup became this art, it became an outlet for me to be creative, for me to express myself, for me to find different facets of who I was,\" she explains. \"But now \u2014 and I'm turning 30 this year \u2014 I do feel like I'm different, I'm changing. I'm more simplified. I know the type of eyeliner I need to wear to look how I want to look. So things have become more refined, and I think that's how my perspective on beauty in general has changed \u2014 it's become more refined.\" Watch this 27 second beauty transformation (inspired by old silent movie screen tests): Collections The March Allure Beauty Box HERE'S A SNEAK PEEK OF WHAT'S INSIDE.
