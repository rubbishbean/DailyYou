As part of a mid-month update, drone pilot Duncan Sinfield has shared a new video of Apple Park, this time getting some gorgeous nighttime shots of the campus lit up at night. In the evenings, the lights on the ring-shaped main building stay on, and it's an impressive sight. The nighttime shots are towards the end of the video, which also shows the completed parking structures, landscaping work with hundreds of trees being planted, final construction on the main building, furniture installation, and more. While employees are set to start working at Apple Park at some point in April, landscaping and construction on auxiliary buildings will continue into the summer. jclo 1 day ago at 05:17 pm I live near Cupertino and it's hard to grasp the scale from the drone video. It looks straight up amazing at night. Rating: 4 Votes coolfactor 1 day ago at 04:53 pm remember HP also had a massive campus and they are not the same company anymore. This all started happening 7 years ago with the purchase of land from HP http://www.mercurynews.com/2010/11/24/apple-makes-big-land-purchase-in-cupertino-2/ But was HP's campus inspiring, designed and built with the planet and people in mind? Or was it just a boring corporate box surrounded by pavement? I think that's a very important distinction. Apple has always had unique values from the very beginning, and I think that influences their course. Rating: 3 Votes zoetmb 1 day ago at 04:46 pm With just 11 days left to the month, I doubt very much that any employees are moving into the main building this month. Employees may start moving in in May, but there's tons of work left to do. Just getting the construction equipment off of the site would take several weeks. I bet it would take days just to get that orange safety netting off the top of the building. All those very large cartons sitting inside the building must be office modules and the like. All of that has to be put together. This place is huge. Lots of work still to do and the place will need to be cleaned top to bottom to get rid of construction dust before employees move in. And I don't know specifically what California's laws are, but I would assume the place needs a certificate of occupancy. I can't see the authorities granting that until most of that interior space is cleared of construction and packaging debris. All of these videos have shown very light traffic on the highways, so I assume they're shot on Sundays, probably early Sunday mornings. And so we also see relatively few construction workers. Anyone familiar with the site during the week? Are there a thousand construction workers there? Because it seems to me that's what it would take to get it ready for move-in if it's happening before June.

I love how they designed to minimize light pollution, as well. Truly an impressive building. Now what will come out of Apple over the next 15 years? That's what this was all for, after all, right?

Apple says the company is working on a \"closed-loop supply chain\" that would allow it to stop mining the earth for rare minerals and metals. \"One day, we'd like to be able to build new products with just recycled materials, including your old products,\" Apple says on its updated Environment site. In an interview with VICE , Apple vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives Lisa Jackson commented on the mining plan, saying \"it's where technology should be going.\" \"We're actually doing something we rarely do, which is announce a goal before we've completely figured out how to do it,\" Apple's Vice President of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives and a former head of the EPA, Lisa Jackson, told VICE News during an exclusive visit to Apple's environmental testing lab on Monday. \"So we're a little nervous, but we also think it's really important, because as a sector we believe it's where technology should be going. Much of what goes into an iPhone isn't recycled, but Apple wants to change that by more aggressively using components taken from old iPhones and combining that with \"high quality recycled metals\" purchased from suppliers. Apple will double down on investments like Liam , the robot that breaks iPhones down into component parts, and it plans to continue to encourage customers to return products through the Apple Renew recycling program. While Apple plans to source more of its materials from recycled goods, Jackson says that though a \"product that lasts is really important,\" the company doesn't have plans to make its devices easier to repair to increase longevity. Jackson also defended Apple's history of making products that are hard to repair. Allowing customers to repair Apple products themselves \"sounds like an easy thing to say,\" she said. But \"technology is really complex; it is sophisticated to make it work, to ensure that you have security and privacy, [and] that somebody isn't giving you bad parts.\" Because of this, Apple won't be taking a \"right to repair\" approach to meeting its environmental goals. \"All those things mean that you want to have certified repairs,\" Jackson said. Other environmental milestones are also outlined in Apple's report. 96 percent of the power used by Apple facilities around the world comes from clean energy sources, and as has been the case for several years, 100 percent of the electricity that powers Apple data centers comes from solar, hydro, and wind energy sources. Apple now has seven suppliers that have committed to using renewable energy, and the company plans to help suppliers bring 4 gigawatts of renewable power online by 2020. When it comes to packaging, more than 99 percent of the packaging used for Apple products is responsibly sourced. Virgin paper is sourced from protected sustainable forests, and the company has successfully protected or created enough working forests to cover all of its packaging needs. Lisa Jackson's full comments on the 2017 environmental report can be read over at VICE , and Apple's full Environmental Responsibility Report, which goes into much more detail on its recycling efforts, packaging, water usage, and carbon footprint, is available here . 1 day ago at 05:17 pm \"Climate change\" Even if you don't believe in climate change or are dead set against \"the liberal agenda,\" why are you against humans being resourceful instead of wasteful?
