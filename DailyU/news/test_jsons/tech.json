As part of a mid-month update, drone pilot Duncan Sinfield has shared a new video of Apple Park, this time getting some gorgeous nighttime shots of the campus lit up at night. In the evenings, the lights on the ring-shaped main building stay on, and it's an impressive sight. The nighttime shots are towards the end of the video, which also shows the completed parking structures, landscaping work with hundreds of trees being planted, final construction on the main building, furniture installation, and more. While employees are set to start working at Apple Park at some point in April, landscaping and construction on auxiliary buildings will continue into the summer. jclo 19 hours ago at 05:17 pm I live near Cupertino and it's hard to grasp the scale from the drone video. It looks straight up amazing at night. Rating: 4 Votes coolfactor 20 hours ago at 04:53 pm remember HP also had a massive campus and they are not the same company anymore. This all started happening 7 years ago with the purchase of land from HP http://www.mercurynews.com/2010/11/24/apple-makes-big-land-purchase-in-cupertino-2/ But was HP's campus inspiring, designed and built with the planet and people in mind? Or was it just a boring corporate box surrounded by pavement? I think that's a very important distinction. Apple has always had unique values from the very beginning, and I think that influences their course. Rating: 3 Votes zoetmb 20 hours ago at 04:46 pm With just 11 days left to the month, I doubt very much that any employees are moving into the main building this month. Employees may start moving in in May, but there's tons of work left to do. Just getting the construction equipment off of the site would take several weeks. I bet it would take days just to get that orange safety netting off the top of the building. All those very large cartons sitting inside the building must be office modules and the like. All of that has to be put together. This place is huge. Lots of work still to do and the place will need to be cleaned top to bottom to get rid of construction dust before employees move in. And I don't know specifically what California's laws are, but I would assume the place needs a certificate of occupancy. I can't see the authorities granting that until most of that interior space is cleared of construction and packaging debris. All of these videos have shown very light traffic on the highways, so I assume they're shot on Sundays, probably early Sunday mornings. And so we also see relatively few construction workers. Anyone familiar with the site during the week? Are there a thousand construction workers there? Because it seems to me that's what it would take to get it ready for move-in if it's happening before June.

Apple says the company is working on a \"closed-loop supply chain\" that would allow it to stop mining the earth for rare minerals and metals. \"One day, we'd like to be able to build new products with just recycled materials, including your old products,\" Apple says on its updated Environment site. In an interview with VICE , Apple vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives Lisa Jackson commented on the mining plan, saying \"it's where technology should be going.\" \"We're actually doing something we rarely do, which is announce a goal before we've completely figured out how to do it,\" Apple's Vice President of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives and a former head of the EPA, Lisa Jackson, told VICE News during an exclusive visit to Apple's environmental testing lab on Monday. \"So we're a little nervous, but we also think it's really important, because as a sector we believe it's where technology should be going. Much of what goes into an iPhone isn't recycled, but Apple wants to change that by more aggressively using components taken from old iPhones and combining that with \"high quality recycled metals\" purchased from suppliers. Apple will double down on investments like Liam , the robot that breaks iPhones down into component parts, and it plans to continue to encourage customers to return products through the Apple Renew recycling program. While Apple plans to source more of its materials from recycled goods, Jackson says that though a \"product that lasts is really important,\" the company doesn't have plans to make its devices easier to repair to increase longevity. Jackson also defended Apple's history of making products that are hard to repair. Allowing customers to repair Apple products themselves \"sounds like an easy thing to say,\" she said. But \"technology is really complex; it is sophisticated to make it work, to ensure that you have security and privacy, [and] that somebody isn't giving you bad parts.\" Because of this, Apple won't be taking a \"right to repair\" approach to meeting its environmental goals. \"All those things mean that you want to have certified repairs,\" Jackson said. Other environmental milestones are also outlined in Apple's report. 96 percent of the power used by Apple facilities around the world comes from clean energy sources, and as has been the case for several years, 100 percent of the electricity that powers Apple data centers comes from solar, hydro, and wind energy sources. Apple now has seven suppliers that have committed to using renewable energy, and the company plans to help suppliers bring 4 gigawatts of renewable power online by 2020. When it comes to packaging, more than 99 percent of the packaging used for Apple products is responsibly sourced. Virgin paper is sourced from protected sustainable forests, and the company has successfully protected or created enough working forests to cover all of its packaging needs. Lisa Jackson's full comments on the 2017 environmental report can be read over at VICE , and Apple's full Environmental Responsibility Report, which goes into much more detail on its recycling efforts, packaging, water usage, and carbon footprint, is available here . 21 hours ago at 05:17 pm \"Climate change\" Even if you don't believe in climate change or are dead set against \"the liberal agenda,\" why are you against humans being resourceful instead of wasteful?

At the event in Beijing, the company highlighted a few new features of the Mi 6 such as its premium 3D glass design, powerful Snapdragon 835 SoC, 6GB of RAM, and dual rear cameras, among other things. Priced at CNY 2,499 (roughly Rs. 23,500) for the 64GB storage and 6GB RAM variant, the smartphone looks to improve on its predecessor, and we take a look at six key Xiaomi Mi 6 features that stand out for the new flagship. Xiaomi Mi 6 design \nXiaomi in recent years has managed to package its smartphones with attractive design elements that please the eyes. With the Xiaomi Mi 6 standing as the flagship smartphone for 2017, the company has gone all out to make a good-looking handset. One of the main highlights of the Mi 6 is its four-sided 3D curved glass with an ultra reflective mirror finish being offered in Blue, Black and White options. Xiaomi has also paid a lot of attention to symmetry. The card slot and volume keys on either sides are perfectly aligned, while the antenna lines are aligned to the display. The bottom sees speaker grilles on either side of the USB Type-C port and no 3.5mm headphone jack. Xiaomi has also kept the back as clean as possible for a mirror-like effect with only a dual camera setup on the top left and the 'Mi' logo on the bottom. The sides of the phone are made from stainless steel for a high-gloss outline. There is also a Ceramic variant. Xiaomi Mi 6 processor \nAs one would expect from a flagship smartphone, the Xiaomi Mi 6 is powered by the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC based on the 10nm manufacturing process. The smartphone is also offered with 6GB of RAM which is large enough to handle multitasking, gaming and pretty much anything you want to throw at it. The latest SoC consumes 25 percent less power as compared to the Snapdragon 820, which translates to a longer battery life for the Mi 6. The SoC also provides Gigabit LTE speeds. Xiaomi Mi 6 dual camera \nThe Mi 6 is touted as the first 5.15-inch smartphone to sport a dual camera setup on the back. The rear sees a pair of 12-megapixel lenses, one wide angle and one telephoto that allows you to have 2x optical lossless zoom. This essentially means that you will be able to capture clear, detailed images even with 10x digital zoom. The rear also features a 4-axis OIS stabilisation system so you won't have to worry about shaky hands getting in the way of that perfect capture. Notably, the dual camera also promises to deliver great depth-of-field captures and uses binocular imaging system and deep learning algorithm to clearly define what needs to be focused and what should be blurred out. Xiaomi Mi 6 fingerprint sensor \nXiaomi has once again managed to push the fingerprint sensor under the glass of the fingerprint sensor front, which is something it had done for the Xiaomi Mi 5s , using ultrasonic technology. According to the company, this implementation will help ensure the fingerprint scanner will not get damaged with use and wear and tear. Bluetooth 5.0 \nBluetooth 5.0 is the next generation in Bluetooth technology. Xiaomi's Mi 6 joins Samsung's Galaxy S8 as being the only two smartphones currently to support Bluetooth 5.0. Xiaomi may not have stressed on this particular feature much but the technology is pretty impressive when compared to the fourth generation Bluetooth technology. Bluetooth 5.0 gives 4x the range, 2x the speed and 8x broadcasting capacity compared to the previous generation. Notably, the new technology is also strong enough to connect the phone to two speakers simultaneously. Stereo speakers \nLastly, Xiaomi took some time to highlight the Mi 6's dual speakers on the top and bottom that the company promises will help deliver immersive stereo effect. The dual speakers aims to deliver a surround sound experience while playing music, video or games.", "crawled": "2017-04-19T23:11:23.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-19T23:11:23.000+03:00", "uuid": "2b04c14693b8f1e156364b4e5b3370fa9eac1a27", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 724, "likes": 724}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "ndtv.com", "participants_count": 0, "site_section": "", "uuid": "2b04c14693b8f1e156364b4e5b3370fa9eac1a27", "section_title": "", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 7, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFqrSjjxZMR.q.3TCKlPESxTUNYSpcwGQZ9kxNKc8d8N9MMgcYQAp5H8bN1x2q.SuefI.ludx0MJwWkjXs0sUeEjWVOsc_AfF7e4dOkFy2rd1FpjEHKWcaXkU0j0KkkbYOA-", "domain_rank": 306, "main_image": "https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/mi_6_1492606379510.jpg", "site_full": "gadgets.ndtv.com", "title_full": "Xiaomi Mi 6: Top 6 Features of New Xiaomi Flagship Smartphone | NDTV Gadgets360.com", "spam_score": 0.629, "title": "Xiaomi Mi 6: Top 6 Features of New Xiaomi Flagship Smartphone | NDTV Gadgets360.com", "published": "2017-04-19T23:11:23.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "beijing"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "xiaomi"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "xiaomi"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "xiaomi mi"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "ndtv"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "xiaomi mi 5s"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "samsung"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFqrSjjxZMR.q.3TCKlPESxTUNYSpcwGQZ9kxNKc8d8N9MMgcYQAp5H8bN1x2q.SuefI.ludx0MJwWkjXs0sUeEjWVOsc_AfF7e4dOkFy2rd1FpjEHKWcaXkU0j0KkkbYOA-", "author": "Sanket Vijayasarathy", "external_links": [], "title": "Xiaomi Mi 6: Top 6 Features of New Xiaomi Flagship Smartphone | NDTV Gadgets360.com", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Apple to Dismantle Iconic Glass Cube at Fifth Avenue Store Wednesday April 19, 2017 12:58 pm PDT by Juli Clover Apple will soon dismantle and remove the iconic glass cube entrance at its Fifth Avenue Apple Store in Manhattan, New York, which is in the process of being renovated and expanded. On March 16, Apple filed a permit for the \"full removal of the glass cubical structure at the Apple Store entrance,\" which, according to BuildZoom, was granted on April 17. The removal of the cube will cost Apple $2 million, and according to a second source, could commence on May 9. Apple is planning to expand its Fifth Avenue store to double the size of the original location. The store is growing from 32,000 square feet to 77,000 square feet, giving Apple more space at its flagship New York location. It is not yet clear what Apple is planning to do with the cube. It could be temporarily removed to allow for construction underneath, or the company could have bigger cube renovation plans in mind. This will be the second time the cube has been dismantled -- it was torn down in 2011 to allow Apple to reconstruct it from larger, more seamless glass panes. Prior to 2011, the cube was made up of more than 90 glass panes, but the new cube uses just 15. While construction is underway at the new location, Apple has temporarily relocated the store to a nearby empty storefront that formerly housed the FAO Schwarz toy store. Apple has not announced when the new store will be complete, but rumors suggest it will have some notable improvements, including a unique area for a Beats 1 radio station that will enable live in-store Beats 1 broadcasts. 13 hours ago at 01:09 pm How does the removal of the cube cost $2 million?

Rating: 3 Votes 13 hours ago at 01:11 pm Are people really obsessed with badges and emojis? Jeebuz! When I was in business school we did a case study on a company where the manager would give one employee every week a cash bonus of one penny. Office morale and productivity went up not because of the monetary value, but because everyone wants to be recognized. Badges and emoji gives you a tangible short term goal to work toward and a reward for achieving it. That's all it takes to motivate some people, including myself.

The Mi 6 is the latest flagship from Xiaomi, and is their first device with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. \n\nThe Xiaomi Mi 6 features a design that incorporates both glass and metal. The stainless steel mid frame of the device is sandwiched between four-sided curved glass on the front and back. There is also an exclusive variant which comes with a ceramic back and comes with 18K gold rims around the two rear camera lenses . The front of the device also sports the 5 .15\u2033 FHD display , which Xiaomi claims comes with 4096 levels of brightness which allows for finer control of display brightness. The Mi 6 also comes with an under-glass fingerprint sensor . Xiaomi also claims that the device is splash-resistant with the SIM tray sealed against splashes, but fails to provide any IP-level protection on the device.\n\nOn the inside, the Xiaomi Mi 6 sports the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, along with 6GB LPDDR4x RAM by default across all variants. For internal storage, the Mi 6 comes in a 64GB variant and a 128GB variant , but there is no microSD expansion to be found on this phone. The device comes with a decently-sized 3,350 mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0 functionality. Given the screen size, resolution and the Snapdragon 835 with its 10nm process, the Mi 6 should be able to provide some good battery life. The Mi 6 also comes with full NFC functionality and Bluetooth 5.0 , but lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack . Xiaomi was also strangely silent on the MIUI version and Android version that the device will ship with.\n\nThe Mi 6 also comes with a dual camera setup on the back. This setup consists of a 12MP wide angle camera with 4-ais OIS and a 12MP telephoto camera that helps in capturing photos with background \u00e0 la Portrait Mode on the iPhone 7 Plus. The front camera on the device is a 8MP shooter. \nThe Mi 6 will be available from April 28, 2017 in China through Mi.com, Mi Home stores and other partner sites. The 64GB variant of the device will cost CNY 2,499 (~$363; \u20b923,500), the 128GB variant of the device will cost CNY 2,899 (~$421; \u20b927,200) while the Ceramic edition will cost CNY 2,999 (~$435; \u20b928,200) . The Mi 6 comes in Black, Blue, White and Silver colors .\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the Xiaomi Mi 6? Do you look forward to purchasing the device?

Xiaomi Mi 6 specifications \nThe big highlight of the Mi 6 is said to be the latest Snapdragon 835 processor integration.

It will feature a 5.1-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixel) display. Xiaomi has confirmed that there will be 6GB of RAM on board, however it will be available in several RAM/ storage bundles listed above.

The Galaxy S8 ships in a stylish all-black box with nothing, but the letters 'S8' in luscious, glossy blue at the front. Open the box and inside we find one of the most comprehensive and richest sets of mobile gear available. No wonder, this is one truly premium flagship (with a truly premium price). The first thing that you see when you open the box of the Galaxy S8 is the phone itself. We have the Midnight Black version and it looks stunning, with a thin, elegant profile and a much taller and narrower body and display. It's surprising how its 5.8-inch display in this taller body results in a phone that is not as wide as traditional phablets, and is still easy to hold in one hand and to use. We take the foil off and start up the phone, but while we wait, let's take a look at what is inside the box... Pair of AKG ear-buds with 2 additional silicon pads (L and M size) Samsung 'Adaptive Fast Charging' wall charger (9V at 1.67A, or 5V at 2A) USB-C to USB-A cable SIM ejector tool User manuals A cool new detail with the Galaxy S8 is that everything inside the box is black: you have a black wall charger, black cables, even black adapters (it's a glossy black, not matte, in case you are wondering). This is a change from earlier Samsung devices where all these accessories were white. Of course, the coolest new accessory in the Galaxy S8 box is the pair of AKG ear buds, a much higher quality set of headphones than the ones that usually come with phones. You get two additional rubber silicone pads with a large and a smaller size to better fit your ear. The buds have a weird, alien-like form and fit comfortably in the ear, and you also have a controller on the chord with a mic. We will take a separate look at these headphones in a separate post, but we're definitely happy to find them in the box. Samsung also include a handy USB-C to traditional USB-A adapter that is useful if you want to transfer data from a flash drive to your phone, and you get a microUSB to USB-C adapter that ensures that you can use an older microUSB cable or an older power bank with a microUSB cable. The 'Adaptive Fast Charging' wall brick is conveniently small and powerful. It starts by delivering 15 watts of power to your phone (9V at 1.67A), and towards the end of the charge switches to a 10-watt output (5V at 2A). Using this charger you will be able to top up your battery quicker than with a regular charger. The rest is manuals and other technical literature that you probably won't even open, but for what it is the Galaxy S8 is a very comprehensive package and comes with all the necessary accessories that we can think of. Great job, Samsung.

The S8 is viewed as an opportunity for Samsung to demonstrate it can produce a fault-free handset, and yet, it looks as though there is a problem. This time it isn't the battery, it's the much more visible display.\nAccording the The Korea Herald , which shared the image you see below, consumers who preordered the S8 and S8 Plus in Korea have taken delivery of their new phones. But the complaints are already starting to appear regarding a reddish tint visible across the display.\n\nSamsung was quick to respond to complaints and claims this is not a display fault. The company advises S8 owners experiencing the reddish tint to adjust the display settings on the phone. However, this apparently isn't working in all cases, so Samsung is allowing an exchange to happen at service centers.\nAs to the cause of the color balance problem, the culprit is thought to be 'deep red' OLEDs. Samsung uses two subpixels in the S8's OLED display, which break down to red-green and blue-green. So as to offset the potential color balance problem of too much green, Samsung strengthened the red color.

After all, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ both have the tough task to deal with large, high-res displays and they have a very powerful system chip (for this test, we have the Exynos 8895 version of the phones, we will test the Snapdragon 835 model at a later point in time), both factors that could potentially consume a lot of power. We have tested the Exynos Galaxy S8 and S8+ model To find out about the Galaxy S8 and S8+ battery life, we put them through our standard test that allows us to compare all phones on equal grounds: with the screen set to the same level (200 nits of brightness, comfortable for typical indoor use). Luckily, the Galaxy S8+ does very well in this test and even though it is not the number one battery performer, it is certainly above the average for flagships these days. Note that we have tested using the Full HD+ resolution that our phones came set to by default (1080 x 2220 pixels). Samsung Galaxy S8+ battery test result Battery life (hours) Samsung Galaxy S8+ 8h (Excellent) Samsung Galaxy S8 8h 22 min (Excellent) Samsung Galaxy S7 edge 7h 18 min (Good) Samsung Galaxy S7 6h 37 min (Average) Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9h 5 min (Excellent) Apple iPhone 7 7h 46 min (Good) LG G6 6h 20 min (Average) Google Pixel XL 7h 19 min (Good) OnePlus 3T 5h 41 min (Average) Huawei P10 7h 42 min (Good) View all The Galaxy S8 and S8+ get similar, but not equal battery life test results. The Galaxy S8+ Exynos model that we tested scored exactly 8 hours , while the more compact S8 Exynos version topped this with a score of 8 hours and 23 minutes. Interestingly, the Snapdragon model of the Galaxy S8 scored less than the Exynos version: it went 10 minutes short of 8 hours. Compare this with the 7 hours and 18 minutes that the already very good Galaxy S7 Edge scored, and you see that Samsung has managed to improve on their last year's phone. The S8 and S8+ also best the Google Pixel XL, the OnePlus 3T, but fall a bit short of the battery life on the iPhone 7 Plus. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ battery will last you through even a very busy day In a nutshell, both the Galaxy S8 with its 3,000 mAh cell, as well as the S8+ with its 3,500 mAh battery run a long time. On a separate note, we have recently noticed that more affordable phones, especially ones with the 14nm Snapdragon 625 system chip, do remarkably well in terms of battery life . In fact, we often get envy-worthy 2-day battery longevity on these phones, while the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are not quite in that territory. Still, when we speak about flagship grade devices, the Galaxy S8+ is definitely among the best out there. With a phone like this, you can be assured that you will get through a busy full day and still have juice left, even if you are a power user, and that is definitely reassuring.

It\u2019s exciting. You can tell, because Facebook isn\u2019t launching another one-point-something version. This is Messenger Platform 2.0. \nSo, what does Messenger Platform 2.0 look like? One theme is Messenger not merely as a tool for social interactions, but a tool for business. David Marcus said that there are 65 million businesses on Messenger. \nMessenger Platform 2.0 emphasizes discovery, with an aim to make it easier to discover those businesses. It aims to be the Yellow Pages of chat apps. A tangible step forward towards this is the Discover Tab, which is populated with relevant bots and businesses. \nIn the same spirit, Facebook is also overhauling Messenger Codes. These launched last year as a way to connect different Messenger users, but didn\u2019t really catch on in the west. That\u2019s a cultural thing. We\u2019re not particularly used to scanning QR codes and the like on a routine basis. \nThese are now easier to use. The company\u2019s Parametric QR codes can be placed anywhere, and can be scanned with Messenger to engage with bots and companies. \nBots also made an appearence, with chat extensions. Previously, bots were things you engaged with one-on-one. Now, you can drag them into group conversations. Spotify is an early adopter here. You can now use it to share tracks within group conversations. \nAlready, there are several major companies signed up, including Uber, the Wall Street Journal, Hipmunk, Kayak, and more. \nAnother major announcement is Smart Replies, which allows small businesses to launch their own intelligent autoresponders. These can answer questions when the social media team are off duty, allowing customers to find out basic details like locations, pricing, and opening hours at any time. \nAlthough announced a little bit earlier, a component of Messenger Platform 2.0 is M Suggestions. This is found in M \u2014 the company\u2019s virtual assistant platform \u2014 and is used to make recommendations about things to do, stickers to use, and so on. \nGames also seen a major overhaul. According to David Marcus, 1.5 billion games have been played over Facebook Messenger, so now the company is introducing rich, real-time and turn-by-turn games. It\u2019s also introducing a games tab, which makes it easier to discover new titles. \nIt\u2019s clear where Facebook is going. It wants Messenger to be a one-stop-shop for everything you do. Work. Play. Social. Cupertino desperately wants Messenger to do it all. \nAnd given what we saw in San Jose, it\u2019s clear to see they\u2019re on the right track.", "crawled": "2017-04-19T00:04:31.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-19T00:04:31.000+03:00", "uuid": "3ae23172e320b285695452c9620f27da327f670c", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 12, "shares": 695, "likes": 695}, "gplus": {"shares": 23}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 106}}, "country": "US", "site": "thenextweb.com", "participants_count": 0, "site_section": "", "uuid": "3ae23172e320b285695452c9620f27da327f670c", "section_title": "", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 6, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPWplkn0Wwwy0buwGT2AQ2Y7uxlU91dFmzaY7SFZ1gDZ8MG7k3hd0FT3JcpWPrifijRYGrNk1G5bYJROVK1Wlc8PKww4J7kWjGiNh3lVo5UfEzA_3fxmV0T.RAQtPJmQQMWE2R9YoVAs_HcUYlt.67", "domain_rank": 1761, "main_image": "https://cdn3.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/04/Messenger20featured.png", "site_full": "thenextweb.com", "title_full": "Facebook\u2019s Messenger Platform 2.0 will be your one-stop-shop for work, play and social", "spam_score": 0.147, "title": "Facebook\u2019s Messenger Platform 2.0 will be your one-stop-shop for work, play and social", "published": "2017-04-19T00:04:31.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "mcenery convention center"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "san jose"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "david marcus"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "facebook"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "parametric"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPWplkn0Wwwy0buwGT2AQ2Y7uxlU91dFmzaY7SFZ1gDZ8MG7k3hd0FT3JcpWPrifijRYGrNk1G5bYJROVK1Wlc8PKww4J7kWjGiNh3lVo5UfEzA_3fxmV0T.RAQtPJmQQMWE2R9YoVAs_HcUYlt.67", "author": "Matthew Hughes", "external_links": [], "title": "Facebook\u2019s Messenger Platform 2.0 will be your one-stop-shop for work, play and social", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "New 'Server-Grade' iMac With Next-Gen Xeon Processor Coming End of 2017   3:49 am PDT by Tim Hardwick Apple's new range of iMac s will launch in the second half of 2017 and will include a \"server-grade\" model to cater for the high end creative professional market, according to Taiwan-based supply chain sources. Apple has already confirmed it is working on new iMac models for release later this year, but today's report offers another hint at what could be in store for creative pros and puts a more specific timeframe on those plans. According to the report, production of two new iMacs is said to begin next month, with a view to launching the consumer desktops between August and October and a \"server-grade model\" at the tail end of 2017. Apple currently has a 21.5-inch and a 27-inch iMac available in the market and the new products are expected to be the upgrades of the two models and are expected to hit the market in the third quarter to catch up with the year-end holiday season. The report comes from DigiTimes , which has a mixed track record when it comes to rumors, but with Apple already having taken the unusual step of confirming it is working on new iMac models for a late 2017 release, this latest information presents a reasonable timeline. In addition, the technical details from the supply chain line up with previously leaked specs for Apple's upcoming upgrades. According to Tuesday's report, the high end iMac will feature Intel's as-yet-unreleased Xeon E3-1285 v6 processor, options for 16 to 64GB error-correcting ECC RAM, up to 2TB NVM Express PCI-e solid-state storage, and more ambiguously, a \"latest discrete graphics card\". Typically, iMacs include a mobile-class GPU rather than a desktop-class card, so this last spec could refer to either, while AMD has a contract with Apple to supply the discrete graphics chips for future high-end 27-inch iMacs. The new iMacs for 2017 are said to be manufactured by Quanta Computer, which is expected to remain the largest all-in-one PC maker in 2017. The earlier report detailing identical tech specs claimed Apple's new iMacs would be accompanied by a brand new keyboard. A previous report said Apple was exploring a standalone keyboard with a Touch Bar and Touch ID , but its release is said to depend on how well those features have been received on the latest MacBook Pro. The original source of the iMac tech specs, Pike's Universum , also claimed Apple is working on an 8K external display, which would presumably feature as part of the company's highest end iMac offering.

According to a Variety report, CEO Evan Spiegel said the app was \"only for rich people\" and not for \"poor countries like India and Spain\". The Snapchat app has since received massive outrage on Twitter as hashtag \"UninstallSnapchat\" and \"BoycottSnapchat\" have been trending. \nVariety report had cited a former Snapchat employee who claimed that CEO Evan Spiegel had no interest in expansion in different markets , and allegedly said that the \"app [Snapchat] is only for rich people,\" adding that he didn't want to \"expand into poor countries like India and Spain.\" \nThe remark claims has put a dent on Snapchat's App Store ratings which dropped to a single star .

Just a day ahead of the launch, the Mi Max 2 render images have been leaked, and it gives us a fair idea on the design details of the device. \nThe images were leaked on Weibo, and they unfortunately do not reveal the front of the device. The Mi Max 2 is seen sporting a full-metal body, with the camera and flash situated on the top left corner at the back. Furthermore, the images reveal dual speaker grilles at the bottom edge of the device and a USB Type-C port. The 3.5mm audio jack is seen on the top of the device, and the fingerprint scanner is situated in the centre at the back, just like its predecessor. Apart from the Micro-USB to USB Type-C port change, there's hardly any design difference from its predecessor. Notably, the camera and flash placement has been reversed. \nPast leaks suggest that the phone will come in variants 4GB RAM + Snapdragon 626 SoC and 6GB RAM + Snapdragon 660 SoC and will be priced between CNY 1,499 (roughly Rs. 14,000) and CNY 1,699 (roughly Rs. 15,900) respectively. \nThe rumour mill also tips that the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 will run Android 7.1.1 Nougat out-of-the-box and will sport a 6.44-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) display. The phone is expected to house a large capacity 5000mAh battery. In terms of optics, the smartphone has been tipped to feature a 12-megapixel rear camera with Sony IMX378 sensor and a 5-megapixel camera at front for taking selfies.

As is typical with new smartphone releases, there are often minor OTA updates available to fix some bugs that weren\u2019t caught in the Q&A process. However, it seems that this time an OTA update is being used to rework how a certain feature on the device works \u2013 the Bixby Button. Apparently, this update is removing the ability to remap the Bixby Button . We knew this was possible, but we didn\u2019t expect Samsung to actually go ahead and do it.\nTo recap, we learned that it was possible to remap the Bixby button to perform pretty much whatever action you wanted back on April 4th. This was made possible due to the fact that, when pressing the Bixby button (or any other hardware button for that matter), the system generates a key up and key down event which can be intercepted by Accessibility Services. Hence why the All in one Gestures application requires you to enable its Accessibility Service in my tutorial.\nAs you might guess, all Samsung would have to do to remove the ability to remap Bixby is to prevent Accessibility Services from intercepting this key event. Which, apparently, is exactly what they are now doing, at least according to XDA Recognized Developer flar2 who is the developer of Button Mapper .\nFlar2 was in the process of updating his Button Mapper application to support remapping the Bixby button soon after he received his Samsung Galaxy S8 from Telus in Canada. He was able to get the application working initially, but after he downloaded the latest system update from Samsung (build version NRD90M.G950WVLU1AQD9), he discovered that his application was no longer working. It turns out that Samsung has modified the system to consume the Bixby button\u2019s key events before it reaches the Accessibility Services, effectively making it impossible to remap the Bixby button as of now ( at least without root access ).\nWe are very disappointed in this development. We understand Samsung\u2019s motivations in wanting to make users use the Bixby button for its intended purpose, but the many tutorials available to remap the Bixby button are simply there for those users who wanted it. If Samsung didn\u2019t want the press to report on the fact that users are seeking the remap the Bixby button, perhaps they should work to get the feature fully working out of the box first .\nUpdate: Samsung Representative Confirms Philip Berne, who heads the reviews program at Samsung U.S.A, has confirmed that Samsung has indeed pulled the plug on the ability to remap the Bixby button.\n@geoff5093 @Lostatsea1923 @One3OneKing @droid_life It was exploiting a system-level behavior. That behavior has been changed. Can't say it will never happen, but we won't officially support.\n\u2014 Philip Berne (@philipberne) April 17, 2017 \n\nAlthough Mr. Berne later states that he can\u2019t say for sure why the behavior has changed (we think the reason is fairly obvious), we disagree with the characterization that the method used to remap the Bixby button is \u201cexploiting a system-level behavior.\u201d Enabling an Accessibility Service to intercept KeyEvents is a perfectly legitimate feature that many applications are built around, there is nothing involving an exploit when a user uses one of these applications.\nMany thanks to flar2 for this scoop! \n", "crawled": "2017-04-17T20:28:02.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-17T20:28:02.000+03:00", "uuid": "847f759a6a4eeb4e104ab1d726ef4a15e8eddff9", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 834, "likes": 834}, "gplus": {"shares": 60}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "xda-developers.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.xda-developers.com/feed/", "uuid": "847f759a6a4eeb4e104ab1d726ef4a15e8eddff9", "section_title": "xda-developers", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 8, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKgnpY5MzwjdcGqTx8jyT88WlK_DeaiOTka7zbSCHRgO2tE7f_7YLHheyLjn5OFr.xDLm8GaUpgdCx8fgiTE5.9Fq5RmbBAPWCLGaVXoifsP7UTjXzwIvsJO3GK.J4H8Mrw15WzyvdiQ--", "domain_rank": 544, "main_image": "https://www1-lw.xda-cdn.com/files/2017/04/apps_bixbyoverview_feature01_pc.jpg", "site_full": "www.xda-developers.com", "title_full": "Samsung has Removed the Ability to Remap the Bixby Button on the Galaxy S8/S8+", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Samsung has Removed the Ability to Remap the Bixby Button on the Galaxy S8/S8+", "published": "2017-04-17T20:28:02.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQKgnpY5MzwjdcGqTx8jyT88WlK_DeaiOTka7zbSCHRgO2tE7f_7YLHheyLjn5OFr.xDLm8GaUpgdCx8fgiTE5.9Fq5RmbBAPWCLGaVXoifsP7UTjXzwIvsJO3GK.J4H8Mrw15WzyvdiQ--", "author": "Mishaal Rahman", "external_links": [], "title": "Samsung has Removed the Ability to Remap the Bixby Button on the Galaxy S8/S8+", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Click To View Slideshow \u00bb Before Atari hit it big with the 2600, these consoles kept the firm's home business alive. \nWhen it comes to home Atari game consoles, many people know and treasure the Atari 2600\u2014and a few may even remember home Pong. But between the launches of those two pioneering gadgets, Atari created several interesting dedicated video game consoles that few people remember today. Predictably, many of those obscure consoles were variations on Pong, but a few others will no doubt surprise and delight anyone not familiar with this early period of home video game history. \nFirst, a little background. Atari first released Pong in the arcade in late 1972, and it spawned dozens of imitators, launching Atari and the coin-op video game industry in a big way. Meanwhile, Pong itself had been modeled upon the earlier Magnavox Odyssey (1972), the first home video game console, which played a similar but more primitive game of video ping pong. \nAfter the modest success of the Odyssey (which, aside from pioneering the video sports concept, had proven the home video game market was viable) and the breakthrough success of arcade Pong, Atari developed its own home console version of Pong that first launched in December 1975 through Sears. \nAfter the success of home Pong, dozens of home console ball-and-paddle clones came on the market. That kept Atari on its toes as the firm tried to continually outdo its earlier versions of the game\u2014and to create entirely new home consoles, some of which were based on Atari's other landmark arcade titles like Breakout, Video Pinball, and Stunt Cycle. \nIn the slides ahead, we'll take a look at some of these classic but mostly forgotten consoles from Atari's early era. \nFor Further Reading: If you're interested in the history of Atari computers , check out ExtremeTech EIC Jamie Lendino's new book Breakout: How Atari 8-Bit Computers Defined a Generation , which is now available in paperback and Kindle for $17.99 and $14.99, respectively. \n( This story was originally published on April 8, 2016. ) ", "crawled": "2017-04-17T19:33:08.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-17T19:33:08.000+03:00", "uuid": "62f70bf1b4b8c984f9396f873bb6bfe8c09022a9", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 847, "likes": 847}, "gplus": {"shares": 8}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 4}}, "country": "US", "site": "pcmag.com", "participants_count": 0, "site_section": "", "uuid": "62f70bf1b4b8c984f9396f873bb6bfe8c09022a9", "section_title": "", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 8, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_EldM0hkfg7y710hjQqoBV2Xs_176oXpK8n2qmFMkc2DOQNyUzmSg2SHk.JVSEj3NArrX7jioNI8mnNvB4.h47PyBVZC9znTJ_Y6JQKFm1N2Z7SXZZs4dK", "domain_rank": 793, "main_image": "https://assets.pcmag.com/media/images/501847-children-of-pong-the-forgotten-early-atari-consoles.jpg?thumb=y&width=810&height=456", "site_full": "www.pcmag.com", "title_full": "Children of Pong: The Forgotten Early Atari Consoles - Slideshow from PCMag.com", "spam_score": 0.663, "title": "Children of Pong: The Forgotten Early Atari Consoles - Slideshow from PCMag.com", "published": "2017-04-17T19:33:08.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "pong"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "sears"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "jamie lendino"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "atari"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_EldM0hkfg7y710hjQqoBV2Xs_176oXpK8n2qmFMkc2DOQNyUzmSg2SHk.JVSEj3NArrX7jioNI8mnNvB4.h47PyBVZC9znTJ_Y6JQKFm1N2Z7SXZZs4dK", "author": "Benj Edwards", "external_links": [], "title": "Children of Pong: The Forgotten Early Atari Consoles - Slideshow from PCMag.com", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "In a bit of breaking news this morning, it appears that Intel has decided to cancel their Intel Developer Forum tradeshow going forward, including this summer\u2019s expected IDF17.\nIn an announcement posted on the IDF website , Intel has announced that IDF is no more, and that the entire IDF program is ending.\nIntel has evolved its event portfolio and decided to retire the IDF program moving forward. Thank you for nearly 20 great years with the Intel Developer Forum! Intel has a number of resources available on intel.com, including a Resource and Design Center with documentation, software, and tools for designers, engineers, and developers. As always, our customers, partners, and developers should reach out to their Intel representative with questions.\nPreviously, Intel had stated that there would not be an IDF in China this year. However an IDF was still expected in the US, albeit with a \u201cnew format.\u201d Prior to today\u2019s update, Intel\u2019s IDF page stated the following (as can be seen on this cached copy of the page ).\nWe are making changes to the Intel Developer Forum. This fall the event in San Francisco will have a new format and we will not be hosting an event in China. More details to come soon.\nMeanwhile the official Moscone Center Calendar had (and still has) Intel reserving Moscone West from August 15 th through the 17 th .\nIDF has been Intel's yearly home to major product announcements. This has spanned from CPU announcements like Skylake and Kaby Lake, to storage products like Optane, to networking fabrics like Omni-Path. So the cancellation of IDF means that Intel no longer has a (currently scheduled) venue to announce new products and update the public and investors on their plans. Though what's more interesting is how this will affect developers (both presenting and attending), who were the heart and soul of the show.\nWhile it seems highly unlikely that Intel is doing away with trade shows and launch events entirely, it\u2019s clear that something is afoot at Intel, and that as a result the traditional IDF is gone. With Intel's product roadmap becoming increasingly elongated and less aligned to a yearly cadence, a yearly tradeshow is obviously a harder event to hold and justify. But what will replace their combination trade show and venue for product announcements remains to be seen.\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Intel for more information, and will update this story if we hear anything further.\nUpdate 13:26 ET (Ian): I just got off the phone with Intel, discussing why IDF is being cancelled. The main reason I was given is that Intel has been changing rapidly over the last two-to-three years, especially as they are changing from a PC-centric company to a data-centric company. With the rise of AI, FPGAs, Optane, IoT, wireless comms, automotive, and the other new areas that Intel is moving into, Intel felt that IDF no longer fills the need when it comes to giving out information. As a result, the decision has been made to find new ways to communicate with the audience (media, developers and companies) and the ecosystem with targeted events. These will be like the recent AI Day or Manufacturing Day, or be connected to partner events, or involve separate geocentric events. So rather than have one big melee on everything, Intel is set to split its message across several different areas in the hope that it accurately digs deep enough into every area. I was told that Intel wants to find a better way to present the experiences in each of the fields, and this is the way to do that.\nPersonally, I feel the loss of an event like IDF is frustrating. Here was an annual event, usually held around the same time each year, that went deep into how Intel is pushing their portfolio in the PC space. In the last couple of years, the event expanded into IoT and automotive, and attendances kept rising (despite some of the hardware talks being attended by six people - trust me it was a fun talk nonetheless). With Intel deciding to move to a multitude of different events, I can understand the need to focus on specific parts at each event - if you want to deep on AI, hold an AI event; if you want to go deep on cloud computing, hold a Cloud Day. However, this gives Intel more opportunities to have a disconnected message, and not speak as one, especially if a particular event is split based on region. It also makes it harder to plan from our side, because undoubtedly we have to travel to an event at a few weeks notice that might occur the same time as a holiday that was paid for six months ago. IDF ensured regularity - there were keynotes on the important topics, and it was a chance for Intel to lay all the high-end cards on the table (and have everyone there to talk to). As noted, Intel also removed IDF Shenzhen from the event schedule. If Intel now plans to have something like an 'x86 developer conference' and have it held on the same day at different global locations, that only adds to the logistical complexity, and splits the key members of the team giving the talk(s) or answering the questions. Again, I can see Intel's reasoning for wanting to focus given the spectrum of markets it is now moving into, but IDF will be missed.", "crawled": "2017-04-17T18:20:35.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-17T18:20:35.000+03:00", "uuid": "8cd0e49164a4e0cf6e679f1ad2a4c677489daa83", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 533, "likes": 533}, "gplus": {"shares": 21}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 189}}, "country": "US", "site": "anandtech.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.anandtech.com/tag/memory/5", "uuid": "8cd0e49164a4e0cf6e679f1ad2a4c677489daa83", "section_title": "Page 5 - Latest Memory Articles and Reviews", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 5, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Ah0a2Ya3Lyh_9lfnEIn8WN_6oUaLDKwbIG15uDyFkdA9K5auKWGokZCNvMOH4n1jXmQfFp5h7s4ZaGINcrRhZmaGzobLFtkB_WfuqwYI0Y5MiMIGHT3Dw11Wvfsr..1g-", "domain_rank": 3377, "main_image": "http://images.anandtech.com/doci/11279/ssp_210_678x452.jpg", "site_full": "www.anandtech.com", "title_full": "Intel Discontinues the Intel Developer Forum; IDF17 Cancelled", "spam_score": 0.001, "title": "Intel Discontinues the Intel Developer Forum; IDF17 Cancelled", "published": "2017-04-17T18:20:35.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg9Ah0a2Ya3Lyh_9lfnEIn8WN_6oUaLDKwbIG15uDyFkdA9K5auKWGokZCNvMOH4n1jXmQfFp5h7s4ZaGINcrRhZmaGzobLFtkB_WfuqwYI0Y5MiMIGHT3Dw11Wvfsr..1g-", "author": "Ryan Smith", "external_links": ["https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20170410071832/http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/intel-developer-forum-idf/san-francisco/2017/idf-2017-san-francisco.html", "http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/intel-developer-forum-idf/san-francisco/2017/idf-2017-san-francisco.html", "https://www.moscone.com/site/do/event/view?id=926&nav.type=0&nav.base=1704&nav.filter=1708"], "title": "Intel Discontinues the Intel Developer Forum; IDF17 Cancelled", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "We've seen the Internet Archive publish classic software collections for MS-Dos , Amiga , Apple II , Windows 3.1 , and classic arcade games .

The update will include improved fingerprint swipe gestures performance, Bluetooth connectivity improvements, new battery usage alerts, and other general software fixes. For those who may fear that the performance of the fingerprint scanner may be affected by this update like what happened to some Pixel smartphones updated to Android 7.1.2, Sony has clarified that the fingerprint scanner performance fix will not be a part of the update pushed to its Xperia X units. The company, however, has warned all Xperia X owners participating in the Concept program to prepare for other possible bugs in the software. Aside from the aforementioned new features, the new software package also changes the setup wizard for the Sony Xperia X that will now only work when Wi-Fi is available, though the manufacturer thinks only a small number of users who constantly use this feature will be affected by the change. \nFor those unfamiliar with Sony\u2019s Xperia X Concept for Android, the Concept initiative, which was launched in 2015, allows users to get a sneak peek of the newest software features Sony will add to its smartphone lineup. Akin to the beta programs of other software manufacturers, Sony\u2019s Xperia X Concept program allows users to provide feedback to Sony, aiding the smartphone manufacturer in improving the software features before it is released to a wider audience. However, the Sony Xperia X Concept program is only available in Europe, specifically to owners of the European single-SIM variant of Sony Xperia X with the model number F5121. \nThe Sony Xperia X is one of the smartphones released by Sony last year and is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 chip featuring the Adreno 510 GPU. The smartphone has 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage, though the storage can be expanded using a microSD card. The Sony Xperia X has a 5-inch 1080p display and a 2,620mAh battery. Sony also equipped its Xperia X with a 23-megapixel rear camera, which has predictive autofocus and FullHD video recording capabilities, as well as a 13-megapixel front-facing camera.

Ahead of the launch, the device has been leaked on several occasions, and teasers from the company have confirmed few specifications as well. The flagship device is said to sport dual rear cameras, thin bezels, will probably bear 6GB of RAM, and is expected to launch alongside a larger variant - Xiaomi Mi 6 Plus . \nPrice The Xiaomi Mi 6 will allegedly be launched in 4GB of RAM + 64GB storage and 4GB + 128GB variants priced at CNY 2,199 (roughly Rs. 20,500), and CNY 2,599 (roughly Rs. 24,300), respectively. The bigger Xiaomi Mi 6 Plus, on the other hand is tipped to be offered in 6GB of RAM + 64GB, 6GB + 128GB, and 6GB + 256GB variants, which will reportedly be priced at CNY 2,699 (roughly Rs. 25,000), CNY 3,099 (roughly Rs. 28,990) and CNY 3,699 (roughly Rs. 34,600), respectively. \nDesign Xiaomi Mi 6's press renders have also been leaked on several occasions, but now, fresh images have surfaced online giving us a full look at the front and back. Sketch leaks on Weibo reiterate the dual camera setup that has already been confirmed by Xiaomi, chamfered edges at the back, and thin bezels in the front. The Home Button is visible in the front, underneath which the fingerprint scanner will presumably be housed. More images leaked by a user named Reviewer on Weibo reveals that the power and volume buttons are housed on the right edge, and there are dual speaker grilles on the bottom edge of the device. At the bottom edge, a USB Type-C port is also visible. Weibo/Reviewer \nSpecifications The big highlight of the Mi 6 is said to be the latest Snapdragon 835 processor integration. It is said to be a big upgrade from the Xiaomi Mi 5, and it is also tipped to sport a dual-edge curved display - at least on one premium variant. \nFrom what we know so far , the Xiaomi Mi 6 runs on Android 7.1.1 Nougat - based on a heretofore unreleased version of MIUI, the company's custom ROM. It will feature a 5.1-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixel) display. Xiaomi has confirmed that there will be 6GB of RAM on board, however it will be available in several RAM/storage bundles listed above. As for camera, the Mi 6 is tipped to sport a 12-megapixel rear camera with 4K video recording support and an 8-megapixel front snapper capable of 4K recording as well. \nMeanwhile, the Mi 6 Plus flagship has been tipped to sport a Quad HD 2K OLED display with dual curved edges and dual rear camera setup, while the Mi 6 will allegedly sport a flat display. Both the flagships are expected to come with Qualcomm's Quick Charge 4.0 technology for fast charging support. The smartphone is also expected to house a 4000mAh battery, although this will likely be for the Mi 6 Plus.

Now however, Reliance Jio is going to continue offering Jio Prime (and the Dhan Dhana Dhan offer) for the near future, though it's unclear for how long.", "crawled": "2017-04-17T14:41:31.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-17T14:41:31.000+03:00", "uuid": "b013146b9d2d68daf6d979b604110e82d255baa3", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 696, "likes": 696}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}}, "country": "US", "site": "ndtv.com", "participants_count": 0, "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/NDTV-LatestNews", "uuid": "b013146b9d2d68daf6d979b604110e82d255baa3", "section_title": "NDTV News  -  Special", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 6, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFqrSjjxZMR.q.3TCKlPESxTXML.Y0uJxAXOiicptW2YTX6NVlxNJi1qrWnSw0cyZLMQPPG_ElHhYfxNfmQyKKxMe.ZTKHwVKp7cS6xszFzsnbAZ_RtG0sHIZO5SnxgFunacVvK8vRfzWqyVaTCGgR.8wK0ITs29D8TviF_Wb5wvfYie0Qz4kBgn.9qRmldh4fw-", "domain_rank": 306, "main_image": "https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/jio_colours_ndtv_1491551459277.jpg", "site_full": "gadgets.ndtv.com", "title_full": "Reliance Jio Starts Disconnecting Those Who Haven't Recharged Yet", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Reliance Jio Starts Disconnecting Those Who Haven't Recharged Yet", "published": "2017-04-17T14:41:31.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "jio"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "reliance jio"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "dhan dhana dhan"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "reliance jio starts"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "trai"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "reliance jio"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "jio dhan dhana dhan"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFqrSjjxZMR.q.3TCKlPESxTXML.Y0uJxAXOiicptW2YTX6NVlxNJi1qrWnSw0cyZLMQPPG_ElHhYfxNfmQyKKxMe.ZTKHwVKp7cS6xszFzsnbAZ_RtG0sHIZO5SnxgFunacVvK8vRfzWqyVaTCGgR.8wK0ITs29D8TviF_Wb5wvfYie0Qz4kBgn.9qRmldh4fw-", "author": "", "external_links": [], "title": "Reliance Jio Starts Disconnecting Those Who Haven't Recharged Yet", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Sunday, April 16, 2017 Wang Wei Image by New York Times The Internet just lost one of its most prominent innovators. Robert W Taylor, a computer scientist who was instrumental in creating the Internet as well as the modern personal computer, has died at the age of 85. Mr. Taylor, who is best known as the mastermind of ARPAnet (precursor of the Internet), had Parkinson's disease and died on Thursday at his home in Woodside, California, his son Kurt Kurt Taylor told US media . While the creation of the Internet was work of many hands, Mr. Taylor made many contributions. As a researcher for the US military's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in 1966, Taylor helped pioneer the concept of shared networks, as he was frustrated with constantly switching between 3 terminals to communicate with researchers across the country. His frustration led the creation of ARPAnet \u2014 a single computer network to link each project with the others \u2014 and this network then evolved into what we now know as the Internet. In a legendary 1968 essay , Mr. Taylor correctly predicted ARPAnet would become an efficient and necessary utility for the public in the future: a vast, decentralized grid of interconnected devices that would reshape communication at every level. \"In a few years, men will be able to communicate more effectively through a machine than face to face,\" Taylor wrote in the 1968 paper. Besides this, Mr. Taylor also played a key role in the creation of the computer Mouse . While working as a project manager for NASA in 1961, he learned of research into the direct interaction between humans and computers being conducted by computer scientist Douglas Engelbart (who died in 2013) at the Stanford Research Institute. Mr. Taylor directed much funding to Engelbart's research, which led to the invention of the mouse, that became an essential element of both Macintosh and Microsoft Windows-based PCs. After almost a decade, Taylor moved on to Xerox's legendary Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in Northern California, where he oversaw the creation of the Alto , a pioneering personal computer. The Alto was the first PC designed to support an operating system based on a graphical user interface with icons, windows, and menus instead of typing text commands in computer language \u2014 a concept that's copied by the operating systems that would follow. Taylor's engineering team also helped develop the networking technology Ethernet and a word processing program called Bravo that became the basis for Microsoft Word. Born in Dallas on 10 February 1932, Mr. Taylor was awarded the National Medal of Technology and Innovation in 1999 for \"visionary leadership in the development of modern computing technology, including computer networks, the personal computer, and the graphical user interface.\" Mr. Taylor, along with other PARC researchers, was also awarded the National Academy of Engineering's Draper Prize in 2004 for the development of \"the first practical networked personal computers.\" Mr. Taylor retired in 1996.

If you\u2019re a gamer, video artist, or media streamer, that\u2019s a useful, no-cost upgrade. Read on if you want your PC to go faster!\nWhat is overclocking, anyway? Overclocking is a technique for tweaking various types of PC hardware, so that it runs faster than the manufacturer\u2019s intended specification. Many processors, RAM modules, and graphics cards can be overclocked, usually by adjusting their settings via your motherboard\u2019s UEFI BIOS.

Images that surfaced earlier this month weren\u2019t particularly good, but this time around we get to see really clear real life shots of the Galaxy S8 Plus prototype with a dual camera setup on the back, along with its whole back side. As you can see, the phone\u2019s heart rate sensor and an LED flash are placed below the dual camera setup, and interestingly enough, the two cameras are aligned vertically and are centered in the middle, they\u2019re not pushed to the side. \nNow, the front side of the device also surfaced, and that part seems to be identical to the one that actually got released. You\u2019ll notice that a fingerprint scanner is not placed on the back of this phone, or the front either, as Samsung originally planned to include a fingerprint scanner below the phone\u2019s display, but they did not have enough time to implement that in partnership with Inventec, at least that\u2019s what recent reports have been saying. The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus would be even more interesting to buyers if they sported a dual camera setup on the back and an in-display fingerprint scanner, but it seems Samsung will have to wait until next-gen Galaxy S devices arrive before they implement something like that, unless the company opts to include both the dual camera setup and an in-display fingerprint scanner in the Galaxy Note 8 later this year, which is possible. \nThe Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus had been announced at the end of last month, and have been available for a pre-order for quite some time now. The two devices will become available really soon, and it seems like quite a few consumers are interested in getting one of the two phones from Samsung. This Korea-based company managed to rake in 600,000 pre-orders for the Galaxy S8 (Plus) in only a couple of days of pre-order availability in their homeland, and that number rose significantly in the following days. All in all, it seems like the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus might outsell the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge, but it\u2019s way too early to make such assumptions, so we\u2019ll have to wait and see what happens.

Do you feel like spending extra for a better phone, but don't want to spend a bomb either? We looked at the best phones under Rs. 20,000 that are available right now, and realised that all the best options are actually much closer to Rs. 15,000 - the most expensive phone among our picks is priced at Rs. 16,999. \nSo let's dive in to our list, and pick out the five best phones on the market under Rs. 20,000, arranged by price. All the phones are devices we've reviewed ourselves so that we can give you our first-hand views, based on the numerical scores assigned in our review process, cross-checked with what actual users are saying online. Devices we haven't reviewed yet, no matter how good they look on paper, will not be on this list. \nHere are the top phones you can buy under Rs. 20,000 right now: Nubia z11 mini S One of the newer phones on this list, the Nubia z11 mini S ( Review ) is priced at Rs. 16,999, going up against the new Moto G5 Plus ( Review ), which has similar pricing and specifications for its top-end variant. The phone has a good build and aesthetics, along with decent cameras, and snappy performance, backed up by all-day battery life. The lack of a fast charge is a problem though - it took an hour to charge just 36 percent. Moto G5 Plus Also priced at Rs. 16,999, the Motorola Moto G5 Plus ( Review ) is a worthy new entry from Motorola and lives up to its predecessors. On the downside, the loudspeaker is not very good, and the low-light camera performance could also be better. It also heats up a bit - however, the near-stock Android Nougat experience, coupled with turbo-charging support, make it a very enticing option. Add to that Motorola's design chops, and general build quality, and you can see why the company remains a major player in this price segment despite the increasing competition. If you're on a tighter budget, then you can also definitely consider the Moto G4 Plus . The last generation phone is still a winner, and it's also around Rs. 2,000 cheaper online. It scores almost as well in all departments, although the newer Moto G5 Plus does have some software improvements that make it a worthy upgrade. That said, if you're on a tight budget, the Moto G4 Plus is not a bad idea. Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime Samsung doesn't have the same presence at lower price points, but over Rs. 15,000 it comes in strong with the Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime ( Review ). The phone scores well on all fronts, particularly battery life and software. The fingerprint scanner can be finicky, which is a surprising problem in 2017, but the phone makes up for this with a superb screen, S Power power management, and overall design and build quality. Lenovo Z2 Plus Along with Motorola, its sibling Lenovo has also had a number of really successful - and really good - phones in the under Rs. 20,000 segment. With the Lenovo Z2 Plus ( Review ), this continues with a phone that is loaded with features and high-end specifications at a decent price. The design and build, along with performance and battery life make this a phone o buy, along with a number of interesting home-button tweaks. It's also fast charger capable, which is pretty important. However, the bundled charger is - very disappointingly - not a fast charge. Also, the camera performance could've been better as well. A more budget friendly alternative is the previous generation Lenovo Zuk Z1 , which is cheaper by Rs. 1,500 - it's a worthy alternative to the Z2 Plus. Xiaomi Mi Max The last pick on this list is less a phone and more a phablet - we feel sorry for ever having found the original Galaxy Note too big - but if you're at peace with that, then the Xiaomi Mi Max ( Review ) is actually a great option, at a really good price. Despite the huge size, this 6.44-inch phone actually looks really good. It also has a striking display, and performs like a champion. And as you can guess, thanks to the large size, it also does swimmingly well on the battery front, with a 4850mAh battery in there. \n\nThere's also the Xiaomi Mi Max Prime which is priced at Rs. 19,999, barely making it in for this list. However, we have not reviewed that variant, so can't say if it lives up to its specs. The Mi Max Prime has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 652 SoC against the SD 650 in the Mi Max, 4GB of RAM against 3GB, and 128GB storage against the standard 32GB. On paper it sounds like an upgrade, but perhaps not one worth the extra Rs. 5,000. If you're on a budget, the better choice would be to check out the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 - its price starts under Rs. 10,000, but we'd suggest the 4GB variant, with 64GB storage, which is priced at Rs. 12,999. Like most budget phones, the camera is a little disappointing, but in other areas it does not disappoint, and it does particularly well in terms of build quality and battery life. \n\nThat's it for our top five picks for phones under Rs. 20,000. Apart from the five picks, we've already given you three budget-friendly alternatives you can buy instead, but let's round that out to an even 10, by mentioning two of our best under-Rs. 10,000 phones available on the market, the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime , and the Lenovo K6 Power . \nThe two phones are very similar, although the Lenovo has a higher resolution full-HD display, and although both are based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 430, the Lenovo is clocked at a slightly higher speed. It also has a slightly better selfie camera. Beyond that, there's a lot to like about both phones, which are sturdy and good looking, reliable performers with great battery life, and are both priced ridiculously cheaply. \nThat said, they do fall short when compared to some of the other phones on this list, but if you're on a budget, they offer options you can consider. \nTell us which of these phones you like, and also let us know about phones you feel should be added to the list, via the comments.

Rating: 16 Votes 1 day ago at 11:18 pm I truly don't see Apple putting the touch ID on the back . Exactly! I am actually quite surprised how quickly people forget what Apple is really known for. Known for taking it's \"forever\" time to try and arguably perfect something before giving it to costumers. And just like they have on the past, they would take their time to make the on screen touch ID work. One thing they will not do is, place it temporarily on the back to have it removed again the following year and put it on the screen. That is more Samsung like kind of strategy.

Unless you have a suction cup for a hand that can grip the back, your fingers need something to hold on to that won't be an issue if its partly obstructed, SOME amount of bezel is a good thing. 2. No bezel means NO CASE THAT CAN WRAP AROUND, this is also a terrible design idea because it means dropping the phone is more dangerous. 3. Non-square screens like this are a TERRIBLE IDEA. They are a *PITA* to program for and place all sorts of odd constraints on what can effectively be displayed there. Even worse? Having a freaking HOLE in the middle of the screen for the speaker and front facing camera parts. Expanding the screen/reducing the bezel is one thing, but its clear the people putting together these mock-ups haven't thought through the engineering and usage constraints. I'm also not sure why eliminating the physical home button is seen as ideal, unless they can incorporate the touch sensor into the screen its going to mean awkwardly sticking the sensor on the back of the phone (ala Samsung). Not to mention you'll have to dedicate that part of the screen to the home button anyway, so you might as well leave it there. Again, there are a LOT of engineering and useability reasons to stick with a physical hardware button (even if its no longer a mechanical switch one, ala the iPhone 7, MacBook Pro trackpad. Rating: 7 Votes odedia 1 day ago at 11:55 pm I think the purpose of the vertical camera to to finally end the disease known as VVS (Vertical Video Syndrome). My guess is that in addition to rotating the pair of lenses, the lens itself is also rotated 90 degrees. Practically all regular users take videos in Portrait mode which is just a bad, bad idea. When you move the video to your TV it looks like a joke. That's why all first person video news reports look so silly and the networks have to add that moving background. If the camera is landscape when you hold your phone in portrait mode, you solved that problem. The UI will need to indicate that but it shouldn't be too hard. Video will be shown in landscape but smaller during recording. People who used to shoot in landscape will be able to accommodate (It is definitely easier to hold the phone in portrait mode while filming).

As a techie, you covet the best gadgets. So when it comes to legging it, you naturally want top-notch gear to play your music clearly and unobtrusively. That means a pair of earphones that fit as snugly as your sneakers, deliver rich sound, and perform well in buckets of sweat. And if a flailing arm has sent your iPhone tumbling down the treadmill one too many times, you know you want something wireless as well. \nBut before you sprint to the store, read our tips on finding The Best Headphones . You'll want to consider which features are most important to you as an athlete. Is comfort, fit, price, sound quality, or style your priority? Earphones for Exercise \nFor the gym, you'll generally want earphones over headphones. They're lighter, more resilient, and are often built for exercise. Even if you prefer the sound headphones offer, you'll find that a good sweat can eat through most earcup pads quickly, and the extra bulk on your head is uncomfortable during a workout. \nBluetooth earphones let you listen to your music without running a wire to your smartphone. They're pricier than wired earphones, but the convenience can be worth it. However, they need power to work, so you'll want to keep an eye on battery life. Of course, if you keep your workouts to a few hours at most and charge your earphones when you get back from the gym, that won't be a problem. Cut the Cord \nThere's a new breed of completely wireless earphones out there, including the Bragi Dash and Samsung Gear IconX. Like Apple's AirPods , these are t ruly wire-free Bluetooth earphones, in that there's no cable connecting the earpieces, which are separate from each other. But the Dash and Gear IconX are far more secure in your ears than the AirPods, making them better for exercise. They also double as fitness trackers, with sensors to track your activity and heart rate while you work out, another trend we're starting to see more of. We're including the IconX on this over the Bragi Dash as they cost $100 less. See How We Test Headphones \nSpeaking of price, as with most enticing tech, quality can cost you. The priciest pairs on the list can be found for upwards of $300. But costs are coming down, and you can still get a very good inexpensive pair for around $40. \nEven if you're averse to the intensity of running, walkers may reap similar benefits to runners , according to a study published in Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology , at least when it comes to blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, and heart disease.

This might seem like a great money-saving idea, but there are some drawbacks you need to think about, as I explained in this valuable Tip . However, one drawback I haven't covered yet is a problem with cellphones themselves. How strong is your provider's cell signal INSIDE your home? \nDo your calls drop out, text messages get stuck and never send or perhaps your internet browsing slows to a crawl? I've heard of some people who have great reception in some rooms at home and virtually none in others. Someone else had excellent coverage with one provider, but then switched carriers for a new plan. Only then did she find out that her new phone rarely connected inside her home. If you are going to use your cellphone as your primary phone, you really need better reliability than that. \nSome buildings seem like they were designed to block your reception. It might be a particular room, a certain spot or anywhere you stand. There's not much you can do about poor reception when using your phone at the store or work, but at home, you don't have to put up with it. \nThat's why I researched ways you can actually boost your cellphone signal inside your home. With a stronger signal, you can feel free to walk from one room to another while talking or be confident that your text messages will actually send. Before you decide to dump your landline, see if these ideas will work for you to ensure you have dependable cell service at home.", "crawled": "2017-04-17T01:26:12.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-17T01:26:12.000+03:00", "uuid": "87c1ba1099c73afbe41fc61cd94a5dec0c9d01a6", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 9, "shares": 855, "likes": 855}, "gplus": {"shares": 14}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 29}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 12}}, "country": "US", "site": "komando.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "https://www.komando.com/feed", "uuid": "87c1ba1099c73afbe41fc61cd94a5dec0c9d01a6", "section_title": "Komando.comKomando.com", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 8, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_I7jQ.eEQtZyYMY22EQWqAHq7BJ_mmhuK7Tgaph1eLsPIuyTFc0PfBpmjK61KtyCE2QGgeKZa8NCKxr41OOg7QL7JdHyDV_N0-", "domain_rank": 8638, "main_image": "https://www.komando.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/phone-breakfast.png", "site_full": "www.komando.com", "title_full": "How to boost cell signals inside your home", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "How to boost cell signals inside your home", "published": "2017-04-17T01:26:12.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [{"sentiment": "neutral", "name": "antonio guille"}, {"sentiment": "neutral", "name": "komando"}], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_I7jQ.eEQtZyYMY22EQWqAHq7BJ_mmhuK7Tgaph1eLsPIuyTFc0PfBpmjK61KtyCE2QGgeKZa8NCKxr41OOg7QL7JdHyDV_N0-", "author": "Komando Staff", "external_links": [], "title": "How to boost cell signals inside your home", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Snapchat CEO allegedly called India a poor country Users are unhappy about the remarks and uninstalling Snapchat Some, it seems, are confused between Snapchat and Snapdeal \nSnapchat has been in the news since Saturday due to alleged remarks by CEO Evan Spiegel. A report in Variety shares the account of ex-Snapchat employee Anthony Pompliano who says that back in 2015 he asked Spiegel about Snapchat's relative lack of growth overseas. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis app [Snapchat] is only for rich people,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Spiegel said, according to Pompliano. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t want to expand into poor countries like India and Spain.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Reaction to Snapchat CEO's alleged 'Poor India' comment \nAs you would expect, Indians on social media have been up in arms since Snapchat CEO's alleged comments came to light. Users on Twitter and Facebook are reacting angrily against Snapchat and its CEO, and leaving negative reviews, while many are also uninstalling the Snapchat app. In fact, at the time of filing this report, Snapchat has an average of 1-star rating in Apple's App Store in India. \nNow, it may not be your preferred method of 'protest', but all this is understandable, and something we've seen before, most notably when users left 1-star reviews for Snapdeal when they were unhappy with remarks made by Snapdeal brand ambassador Aamir Khan. Interestingly, Snapdeal has found itself at the receiving end of more 1-star reviews this week thanks to Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel's remarks, possibly because some people can't seem to differentiate between Snapchat and Snapdeal. Snapdeal caught in backlash against Snapchat CEO \nSample some of these reviews for the Snapdeal app in Google Play, which have been left since Snapchat CEO's alleged remarks came to light. Some of these have been edited to remove profanity. \n\"Ceo u told that india is a poor country... I bought countless products from snapdeal.. Dont say like that... Now m gonna delet my account from SD ... Hate u and hate your apps...,\" said one user on Google Play while leaving the Snapdeal app a 1-star review. \"I think Evan Thomas Spiegel is having very poor intelligence. Pathetic service n attitude,\" said another while doing the same. \n\"How dare you call Indians as poor. Tell your angrez ceo to pack his bags.. I am uninstalling\u00e2\u0080\u008b your app.. I will never put any orders.. Flipkart is better than you. They have better delivery system.. And they don't call their customers poor,\" said another reviewer of the Snapdeal Android app, while giving a 1-star rating. \nSome others, all left while giving the Snapdeal app 1-star rating: Because of the statement about india I am gonna un install snapdeal too! Ceo said india is poor b b \nWe could go on and on, but we are sure you get the idea. \nThankfully, people seem to have realised that many are confused between Snapdeal and Snapchat and giving the former 1-star reviews, so they are leaving the Snapdeal app 5-star reviews in an attempt to, what they say, is 'balance' things out. Here are a few: Snapdeal and snapchat both are different apps. Please stop the stupid propoganda of giving 1 star. Giving 5 stars to nullify 1 star rating. Just for balancing. This is snapDEAL not snapCHat. Do not confuse.

The update, which has the build number 00CN_3_170, is a quite hefty update at 369 MB, so downloading the update through Wi-Fi is recommended. The update contains the Android 7.1.1 software update, which adds some new features like additional emojis, directly sending GIFs from the smartphone keyboard to supported apps, and app shortcuts direct from the home screen. This update makes Nokia 6 one of the few smartphones that currently run Android 7.1.1. Nokia 6 users will also experience improved background apps management and power saving features once they download the update. There will also be improvements in the connectivity features of Nokia 6, with the update adding support for 4G/3G dual-SIM dual-standby and improvements on the Nokia USB driver. Along with these new features and improvements is the installation of April 2017 security patch for Nokia 6, the latest security patch available from Google. \nThe update, which includes the latest security patch and an OS update, shows HMD Global\u2019s commitment to supporting the smartphones it manufactures once they are released. HMD Global, the company producing the Nokia-branded smartphones, highlighted its commitment to monthly updates when it was asked by an interested consumer regarding its software update timeline through its official Twitter account. Owners of Nokia smartphones can expect updates each month, securing the smartphones against any recently discovered vulnerabilities in the Android operating system as well as updating the smartphones to support the latest features of the Android OS. \nFor those interested in the specifications of Nokia 6 , the smartphone sports a 5.5 inch full HD (1920 x 1080) display and is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 SoC, which is comprised of a 64-bit octa-core chip and Adreno 505 GPU. Nokia 6 is available with either 3GB or 4GB of RAM and either 32GB or 64GB of internal storage, with an option to expand the storage using a microSD card. The device is powered by a 3,000mAh non-removable battery and supports Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 for quick top-ups of the internal battery. Nokia 6, at this point, is currently available only in China and other select markets. However, HMD Global has committed to launching not only the Nokia 6 but also its other smartphones Nokia 5 and Nokia 3 simultaneously in 120 markets in the 2nd quarter of 2017.

Which means it is a bit thicker than most other smartphones, and that also means no more camera bump here. The Moto E4 Plus has what appears to be mostly a flush backside with the camera looking the same as the Moto G5 Plus , with a rather large module on the back. \nFrom these CAD renders, we can also see that Motorola is sticking to micro USB on their non-flagship smartphones, and there is a 3.5mm headphone jack on this one, which is nice to see. There\u2019s a physical button on the front, it\u2019s unclear if this will just be a home button with gestures like what we see on the Moto G5 Plus or if it will also be a fingerprint sensor. Since the Moto E lineup has always been a rather low-end set of smartphones, this may not have a fingerprint sensor. We\u2019ll find that out when the device goes official, which looks to be fairly soon. The source has told Android Authority that the device will have a 5-inch display and is using 2.5D glass here, allowing for a pretty great looking front on a pretty cheap device. The resolution of the phone has not been mentioned though. \nThe Moto E4 Plus appears to be a pretty good device for those wanting something to last them a couple of days. Motorola\u2019s parent company Lenovo, has been making phones like the Moto E4 Plus for quite some time. Something with low-end specs, and a huge battery, which means that the device is going to last quite a while, since it\u2019s using a lower-end processor and it has less processes going on in the background. Making for a great experience. Right now it\u2019s unclear where the Moto E4 Plus will be available when it is announced and launched. But it\u2019s worth nothing that the Moto E3 was only available in a few markets, mostly in Europe and Asia, and that could be the case this time around as well.

It is the best smartphone in the world and offers several enhancements over the iPhone 7. | Topic: Mobility VIDEO: Samsung Galaxy S8 vs Apple iPhone 7: Things to consider before choosing \nAfter attending the Samsung Galaxy S8 launch event, I put together my best 10 smartphones post for the first part of 2017. The Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus were selected for the top spot. \nNext week the S8 and S8 Plus arrive into the hands of buyers. Read More \nReports from Samsung indicate it has already pre-sold more than 728,000 units with a target of 1 million prior to the April 21 launch date. \nI previously posted eight reasons the Galaxy S8 is good for business. As a supplement to that list, here are 10 reasons to consider the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus, check out my full review , instead of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus, which was selected in the second spot of my 10 best smartphones. \n1. Display : The Galaxy S8 Plus has a 6.2-inch display with no side bezels and small top and bottom bezels. It is also narrower than the Apple iPhone 7 Plus, which has a 5.5-inch display. Independent testing also shows the Galaxy S8 has the highest rated display of all smartphones. \n2. Fast charging and wireless charging : Actual battery life testing remains to be conducted for the Galaxy S8. However, if you do need to top off, it only takes a few minutes via USB Type-C or a wireless dock. It's a bit frustrating to charge up an iPhone 7 Plus, which explains why there is such a large market for slap on battery packs. \n3. microSD expansion : The iPhone 7 Plus has three memory configurations available, with the largest capacity 256GB being more than enough for most people. The Galaxy S8 Plus offers 64GB internal memory with a microSD storage card slot so you can pop inexpensive storage cards in and out as you please. \n4. Gorilla Glass 5 : Apple has glass on the front and metal on the back while the Galaxy S8 has glass on the front and back. However, this glass is Gorilla Glass 5 that is designed for increased drop protection over previous glass panels, surviving 1.6 meter, shoulder height drops. \n5. Multiple security options : With the Galaxy S8, you can set it up to unlock via facial recognition, iris scanning, fingerprint, pattern, PIN, or a password. The iPhone 7 Plus has a fast fingerprint scanner with options for a password or PIN, but Samsung's iris scanner may be a more convenient and secure option. \n6. Samsung DeX : People use their smartphones for everything today and with Samsung DeX , users now have the option to leave the laptop behind, by connecting their smartphone to a monitor and using it in place of a desktop computer. I'll be testing this exact capability on two upcoming business trips. Apple has no ability to extend the iPhone to an external display. \n7. Virtual reality : Samsung continues to improve its virtual reality experience with a handheld controller now included with the Gear VR. While VR can be used for games or media viewing, there are also enterprise reasons for VR. These include presenting virtual walkthroughs of engineering designs, medical procedure reviews, and interactive presentations. \n8. Bixby : There is a ton of potential in Samsung Bixby as it looks to improve the efficiency and productivity of the user. Unfortunately, Bixby's voice assistant won't be ready at launch so we will only get a glimpse of the Bixby service with a home screen panel similar to Google Now. With a dedicated button on the Galaxy S8, Samsung is committed to making Bixby all it promises to be and I look forward to making regular tasks more convenient and intuitive. \n9. Bluetooth 5.0 : You may not have seen or heard that the Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus will be the first phones to launch with Bluetooth 5.0 support. Bluetooth 5.0 improves connectivity performance, extends the range of Bluetooth, and allows you to connect two Bluetooth headphones to one Galaxy S8 at the same time. \n10. Samsung Pay : Apple Pay is popular, but nothing beats Samsung Pay when it comes to the number of retail locations that are supported. The technology allows you to replace your credit or debit card. I made a couple of purchases with my Gear S3 smartwatch using Samsung Pay at a location that stated it did not accept wireless payments. More banks are added regularly and Samsung also offers a ton of promotions to encourage Samsung Pay use. \n11. Headphone jack : While Apple thinks it was courageous to take away the headphone jack, most people still use headphones with a standard 3.5mm connector. With Samsung's purchase of Harman last year, buyers receive a nice pair of wired headphones in the box. While I appreciate and use Bluetooth headphones quite often, a 3.5mm headphone jack is convenient and economical while not having to worry about charging up another device. \nIt's clear that Samsung continues to push smartphone technology forward and Apple is looking a bit dated with the iPhone 7. However, Apple still offers a compelling experience as well and not all of Samsung's ideas and technologies are vital to the daily usage needs of all users. \nStay tuned for a full review of the Samsung Galaxy S8, S8 Plus, and accessories. \nRelated coverage:", "crawled": "2017-04-15T18:35:32.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-15T18:35:32.000+03:00", "uuid": "8f2bfa95250d82c192d5fdbfd0cc383f152f20da", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 662, "likes": 662}, "gplus": {"shares": 31}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 130}}, "country": "US", "site": "zdnet.com", "participants_count": 0, "site_section": "http://www.zdnet.com/topic-samsung/rss.xml", "uuid": "8f2bfa95250d82c192d5fdbfd0cc383f152f20da", "section_title": "Latest topics for ZDNet in Samsung", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 6, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R2i9k5tvFmNJj7p0ZI8H0O9lMs6fBEl00a4uB7DBBjFCD11wSQDWgbtlp5pc7TOORhGt.CS9xHK7NDveVaVHA4KbCw60x2ezoEW9cdOmzez9w01u5VNWYLNtFNIfAMJ_12E.PwapOOQ--", "domain_rank": 1869, "main_image": "http://zdnet4.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/03/28/4ff1191b-0542-4ba1-b9d2-ecf2ed298f4b/thumbnail/770x578/0ef4651fdaca65fb2d13a3fb4f78df0f/samsung-galaxy-s8-gear-vr-gear-360-dex-bixby-18.jpg", "site_full": "www.zdnet.com", "title_full": "11 reasons the Samsung Galaxy S8 is better than the Apple iPhone 7 for business", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "11 reasons the Samsung Galaxy S8 is better than the Apple iPhone 7 for business", "published": "2017-04-15T18:35:32.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "harman"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "bixby"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "apple"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "samsung galaxy s8"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "zdnet japan"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "samsung galaxy"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "google"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "samsung bixby"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "samsung"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.R2i9k5tvFmNJj7p0ZI8H0O9lMs6fBEl00a4uB7DBBjFCD11wSQDWgbtlp5pc7TOORhGt.CS9xHK7NDveVaVHA4KbCw60x2ezoEW9cdOmzez9w01u5VNWYLNtFNIfAMJ_12E.PwapOOQ--", "author": "", "external_links": [], "title": "11 reasons the Samsung Galaxy S8 is better than the Apple iPhone 7 for business", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Android 7.1.2 Is Disabling Some Pixel Fingerprint Sensors   Justin Diaz \nAndroid 7.1.2 is disabling some Pixel fingerprint sensors according to reports over on the Google Product forums. Though not all users with a Pixel and a Pixel XL on the most recent version of Android Nougat are having the problem, a number of users on the forums are already expressing issues with their fingerprint sensors no longer working post update. Some users are reporting the issue arising after receiving the update over-the-air and installing the downloaded software while others are reporting the same experiences of the sensor not working after sideloading the update through adb, so it would seem that it isn\u2019t just limited to those that received the update alert and downloaded it through the official means. \nIn addition to Pixel owners, it would seem that some Nexus users are reporting the same problem as well. In regards to Nexus devices the issue is affecting owners of both the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P who have also installed the update. Some users of both sets of devices are reporting that the device is telling them fingerprint hardware is not available when trying to unlock the device using this method instead of inputting a PIN or password. \nIn this instance the first instinct might be to clear your cache and reboot the device, as well as delete the fingerprint and try to enter in new ones. According to users though the reboot and the clearing of cache data isn\u2019t helping the issue, and error messages are popping up that are stating users are prohibited from entering in new fingerprints after they\u2019ve been deleted, so the only thing to do at this point might be to either wait for Google to find a fix, or try to revert back to Android 7.1.1 if that is a viable option. Unfortunately it doesn\u2019t seem like Google has a time frame on a fix yet, but it seems that they\u2019re at least aware of the issue being present. The silver lining perhaps is that the problem seems to only be affecting the unlocking process, with at least one user stating that using the fingerprint sensor\u2019s swipe gestures for bringing down the notification shade still results in the intended function being completed successfully.

The decision comes amid unexpectedly high demand for LCD panels, especially in the areas of large consumer-targeting TVs, along with specialty products for the IT field. Along with the high demand, naturally, both firms have their own reasons for deciding to continue producing LCD panels as they have been for just a little bit longer. Neither company announced a timeline for when they may actually start tapering down LCD production, essentially saying that they will continue to monitor the situation. \nThe increased demand is not only the result of unexpected surges of popularity among key LCD products, but also an ongoing LCD shortage that was predicted to only plague the market until the second quarter of the year. Well into the second quarter, however, reports say that the shortages continue. For Samsung\u2019s part, they have stopped receiving LCD panels from Sharp, which means that they will have to fulfill all of their LCD orders using their own means of production. Research firm IHS Market sees the situation as a flex arrangement, saying that the imbalance between supply and demand in the industry may get as high as 10% before it\u2019s all said and done. \nLG Display\u2019s LCD plants that were due to start the closing down process during this quarter include plants in their 3.5th generation lineup, their 4th generation lineup, and their 5th generation lineup. According to IHS Market, these are all types of LCD plants that have lost production efficiency recently, and are projected to become even less efficient as processes evolve further and products become more advanced. Samsung Display, meanwhile, had planned to shutter or convert plants that were in their 6th and 7th generation LCD production lines. Given the recent fluxuation and unexpected surges in the LCD market, it\u2019s anybody\u2019s guess as to how Samsung Display and LG Display will approach eventually halting LCD production.

They would like to eliminate passwords at ATMs and strictly use biometric methods as a means to verify a customer\u2019s identity, which would greatly increase security as well as making it easier for the customer. Pulling up to an ATM machine to request money, may be as simple as looking at the machine to have your eyes scanned. Other options could include using your fingerprint or possibly voice recognition \u2013 Wells Fargo is testing them all because they realize that different circumstances could require a different form of biometrics. Steve Ellis, head of Wells Fargo\u2019s innovation group said, \u201cOur view is they [customers] can decide which they want to use in the moment they\u2019re trying to. For example, if I\u2019m driving in my car and I want to talk to the bank, I\u2019m not going to authenticate with my fingerprint but maybe my voice could be the password.\u201d Voice recognition could completely replace the need for user IDs and passwords entered on a keypad. \nWhat is so amazing about the adoption of biometrics is that many developing nations have embraced the technology while US banks and other institutions are dragging their feet over its adaptation. In India you can verify yourself for banking activities via a thumbprint and Australia\u2019s ANZ Bank is now running a pilot project to use voice authorization for transactions of $750 USD and over. The problem with US Banks is trying to decide what method or combination of methods of sign in will be acceptable. In the meantime, Wells Fargo has embraced the biometrics technology in an effort to add both security and convenience for their customers. Hackers are way too comfortable stealing passwords at ATM machines or even other areas where you have to scan your card and then enter your pin number. Duplicating your thumbprint makes it much harder on hackers, but is still not impossible \u2013 it just requires a lot more work on their part. Voice recognition is really getting nearly impossible to duplicate with the sophisticated hardware that can tell the difference between a live or a recorded voice pattern. Using voice recognition could verify you instantly when calling into the bank\u2019s automated or customer services number. Eye scanning, Iris scanning, or Eyeprints \u2013 whatever you want to call them \u2013 will be used by the end of this quarter to verify commercial customers. This technology uses the mapping of blood vessels and other details from your eyes to verify your identity \u2013 Samsung\u2019s latest Galaxy S8 has this and facial recognition built into the smartphone to unlock the device. \nSome of the other big banks in the US are following Wells Fargo\u2019s lead and starting to implement biometrics. U.S. Bank and JPMorgan Chase allow customers to log into their mobile app with a fingerprint as well as some companies such as PayPal. Citibank has expanded logging onto their mobile app to include a fingerprint, voice or facial recognition, PIN or the old-fashioned password. Biometric companies say that banks are still reluctant about using biometrics due to regulations and legalities surrounding the biometric data, but more than that there is resistance from senior executives still leery of the technology. Other forces that drive the change to biometrics are the customers, which do not seem to be demanding the changes as many bank customers are older and barely use a smartphone except to text the kids or exchange pictures. Mobile banking was pushed early on in many emerging markets where desktop banking was bypassed for mobile banking and those countries have used mobile banking longer and are now more comfortable banking via their smartphone. The US has a system all banks are comfortable using \u2013 an ATM card and password \u2013 and until they can decide on a new standard, most of the US banks will be lagging behind Wells Fargo in a field that expects rapid growth over the next few years.

The Galaxy S8 with its large Infinity Display and all-glass backing takes on the updated all-metal OP3T. Does the new Galaxy S8 have what it takes to outclass the revised OP3T? Samsung completely revised its Galaxy S series while the OnePlus took their popular OnePlus 3 and gave it new life with a few improvements. The OnePlus 3T will only work on AT&T and T-Mobile in the US for 4G LTE and the Galaxy S8 will work on all major carriers. Let\u2019s look at just what these two devices have in common, if anything, and then we will take a closer look at each one in hopes that we can determine a winner of this comparison. \nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 and the OnePlus 3T have a few things in common. The displays of the two devices are 0.3-inch different in size, but the larger S8 is slightly smaller in physical size and weighing in at 3 grams lighter than the OnePlus 3T. The displays both use the AMOLED technology, but the different resolutions, and different Gorilla Glass for protection. They use different processors and GPUs, although both come from Snapdragon and Adreno. They pack different amounts of RAM \u2013 6GB in the OnePlus 3T and 4GB in the S8 \u2013 the same amount of storage at 64GB, but only the S8 has the means to expand its memory via a microSD card. The primary camera areas and the front-facing camera (FFC) areas could not be more different \u2013 the Galaxy S8 uses a 12MP camera, and the OnePlus 3T uses one 16MP sensor \u2013 but both take great pictures. The FCC on the Galaxy S8 uses an 8MP while the OnePlus 3T uses another 16MP sensor. Both have a fingerprint sensor for unlocking the device as well as NFC for authorizing mobile payments, including Android Pay. They both use a non-removable battery, and both have rapid charge capabilities. They come with the usual suspects \u2013 WiFi, Bluetooth (v5.0 in the S8 and v4.2 in the OP3T), GPS, NFC, and the newer reversible Type-C port for charging and data transfer. \nPlease take a thoughtful look at the detailed Specifications Comparison chart below, and here you will see just how these two great devices stack up against one another \u2013 click on the \u201cView Full Comparison\u201d link at the end of the chart to expand the details. After that, we will look at each device in greater depth and point out some of its pros and cons. From all of this information, we will try to determine the winner based on specs and execution of design and functions. \nSpecifications \nSamsung Galaxy S8 \nSamsung dropped the flat display on the Galaxy S8 and introduced us to their new Infinity Display that has no left or right bezels, making it look completely different from its predecessor. Gone is the physical \u2018Home\u2019 button, and gone are the \u2018Back\u2019 and \u2018App\u2019 keys that are now located on the lower part of the display that has 3D Touch capabilities. Samsung moved the fingerprint sensor to the back and awkwardly located it near the camera lens; but Samsung added easier ways to unlock the device by way of facial recognition and an iris scanner. Just in the appearance alone, the Galaxy S8 is one sexy looking device, but did Samsung upgrade the specifications enough, and just how does it stack up to the much cheaper OnePlus 3T. \nSamsung increased their Galaxy S8 from the 5.1-inch display used on the previous S series to a much larger 5.8-inch Infinity Display. Because the Super AMOLED display uses an 18.5:9 aspect ratio that makes it taller and slightly narrower and causes it to have a QHD+ display resolution of 2960 x 1440 pixels and 570 pixels-per-inch (PPI). The new display goes from edge-to-edge and takes up 83.6-percent of the front of the phone. When you unbox your Galaxy S8, the default resolution is set at 2220 x 1080 to conserve battery life, but you can jump into the settings and move it up. Samsung continued the tradition of the \u2018always-on\u2019 screen to help save battery life and to make it easier and quicker to check notifications. Samsung uses the newest Corning Gorilla Glass 5 to protect the front and back of the device. Samsung is the first to use the 10nm technology found in the newest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 octa-core processor. It is clocked at 2.35GHz with an Adreno 540 GPU rounding out the model coming to the US. The other countries will get Samsung\u2019s excellent Exynos 8895 octa-core 10nm processor with four cores clocked at 1.7GHz and four cores clocked at 2.3GHz. The Galaxy S8 packs 4GB of DDR4 RAM and has 64GB of the faster UFS 2.1 expandable memory via a microSD card. \nSamsung decided to stick with the excellent camera from the Galaxy S7 with a Dual Pixel 12MP sensor. Samsung decided to concentrate on making advancements to their imaging software, and so far, the picture quality looks excellent. The Galaxy S8 uses the same large aperture of f/1.7, a 26mm lens, PDAF, LED flash, auto HDR and OIS. Samsung did tinker around to the FFC by enlarging it from a 5MP to an 8MP sensor and then added its own autofocus. It still is a wide-angle lens, the same f/1.7 aperture, and Live HDR. Samsung also kept the same sized non-removable 3000mAh battery that features Quick Charge and still offers Quick Wireless Charging. \nPer Samsung\u2019s usual practice, the Galaxy S8 has many features crammed in \u2013 some more useful than others. It comes with a useful IP68 certification, against dust and water, a heart rate monitor for those that exercise, an oxygen saturation sensor, and the new Samsung Health replaces Samsung\u2019s S-Health. Samsung wanted its own personal assistant so Bixby is now part of the package. Bixby involves the camera as an option to answer your questions. If you point it at a historical building, you will receive some facts regarding the structure. If you aim the camera at a sign written in a foreign language, Bixby will translate it for you. The Galaxy S8 sports a new Samsung Connect feature to tie together Samsung\u2019s appliances, SmartTVs, thermostats and other IoT (Internet of Things) devices. Samsung added another feature that has never proven to be popular \u2013 a DeX Station that will interface the Galaxy S8 with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse for a near desktop experience. Because it is a Samsung device, the S8 can use both Android Pay as well as Samsung Pay, which allows Galaxy S8 users more freedom to make mobile purchases. The Galaxy S8 will arrive one of two ways \u2013 with Android Nougat 7.0, followed by a quick upgrade, or it may include 7.1 by release time. It measures 148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0 mm, weighs in at 155 grams, is available in Midnight Black, Orchid Gray, Arctic Silver, Coral Blue, and Maple Gold depending where you are located. The Galaxy S8 will cost about $720 outright and is now available for pre-order with delivery no later than April 21. \nOnePlus 3T \nOnePlus took their OnePlus 3 , updated it with a Snapdragon 821, and started selling their new flagship as the OnePlus 3T. The two devices are physically identical looking except for a subtle color change to a Gunmetal color. The Snapdragon 821 is reported to be 10-percent faster than the Snapdragon 820. OnePlus also improved the battery size from 3000mAh to 3400mAh and added a scratch-resistant lens cover over the primary camera. Because the OnePlus 3T has no expandable memory you have to settle for the base 64GB model or you can now purchase a 128GB model. The OnePlus 3T is an all-metal device that has excellent build quality, decent specs, and a decent price but how does it hold up to the more expensive Samsung Galaxy S8? \nOnePlus does not like to use QHD displays, and the OnePlus 3T comes with their familiar FHD display with a new 5.5-inch FHD Optic AMOLED display with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and a respectable 401 PPI. The OnePlus 3T includes the new Snapdragon 821 with the same dual cores as the 820 clocked at 1.6GHz and another at 2.35GHz and running the same Adreno 530 GPU as the OnePlus 3. The OnePlus 3T packs a full 6GB of DDR4 RAM and 64GB of the faster UFS 2.0 internal storage. There is no expansion available, but you can now order a model with 128GB of internal memory. \nOnePlus carried over the same excellent camera from the original OnePlus 3 but now includes a more scratch-resistant sapphire covered lens. The OnePlus 3T uses PDAF, an LED Flash, a large f/2.0 aperture, and OIS for stability. The FFC camera increased from an already large 8MP to a huge 16MP with a f/2.0 aperture to take great selfies and for video chatting. The OnePlus 3T has a larger 3400mAh non-removable battery that includes OnePlus\u2019 Dash Charge that will give you up to a 60-percent charge in only 30 minutes. \nOnePlus has had a few hits and misses when it comes putting out a \u2018complete\u2019 smartphone, but the OnePlus 3T is OnePlus\u2019 best effort. They included both a fingerprint sensor and NFC chip on their OnePlus 3T, allowing the user to make mobile payments as well as use Android Pay. If OnePlus would only include a model that would work on Verizon and Sprint, more users could enjoy the OnePlus experience. It runs mostly stock Android 7.0 Nougat (upgraded) with OnePlus\u2019 OS called OxygenOS on top. The OnePlus 3T measures 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.35mm and weighs in at 158 grams. It will cost you about $440 USD for the 6GB/64GB model and about $480 for the 6GB/128GB model, and there is a choice of Gunmetal, Soft Gold, or Midnight Black. \n\u2026And The Winner Is\u2026 \nThe Final Word \nThis was a tough decision \u2013 not in deciding which smartphone has the best specs as that would be the Samsung Galaxy S8 hands down \u2013 but because of the tremendous value that the OnePlus 3T offers. The OnePlus 3T\u2019s biggest liabilities are the lack of memory expansion and the fact it will not work on the Verizon or Sprint networks. However, because this is a comparison on specifications, I am picking the Samsung Galaxy S8 as the winner in that department. \nIt is a no brainer with the larger, QHD+ Infinity Display, always-on display, the Snapdragon 835 processor, the Adreno 540 GPU, memory expansion, Facial Recognition, an Iris Scanner, IP68 certification, Heart Rate Monitor, Hi-Res Audio, Samsung Pay, Samsung Connect, Samsung DeX, and wireless charging. The Samsung Galaxy S8 at $720 is the complete package. \nHowever, you may be an individual that doesn\u2019t need the \u2018complete package\u2019 \u2013 if you are already using T-Mobile or AT&T, you care about nice photos, but not about memory expansion, and like a little larger battery and are okay with a FHD resolution display, then the $440 OnePlus 3T could be the smartphone for you. While an extra $270 will buy you the Aston Martin, the Cadillac might just suit you fine.

Cathair2906 also upgraded the device from Android 6.0.1 to Android 7.1.1 using official OTA without any issues and everything is working as it should, including the RAM. \nThe repair and upgrade was done by a technician in China, so you would need experienced hands if you wish to try it out yourself. The upgrade cost him CNY 600 ($60), and the member claims the storage can be increased as well. However, he does not recommend this to users whose Nexus 5X are not bootlooping. The contact of the repairman was not revealed, so interested users will have to do their own digging as well. \nNevertheless, this is an interesting hardware modification to the Nexus 5X that fixes one of its bottleneck areas and gives the device extra longevity. Since the device was bootlooping ( Thanks LG ), this gives the phone a whole extra life. \nWhat are your thoughts on the new hardware mod? Would you be interested in doing this for your device?

Verily Life Sciences, the health spinout of search giant Google, unveiled a health tracking watch that it plans to deploy in large-scale medical studies.\nThe gadget, known simply as \u201cStudy Watch,\u201d looks like an ordinary wrist watch and has a low-power e-ink type display.\nWith the watch, Verily says it now has a way to unobtrusively, but continuously, collect physiological data from volunteers. According to Verily, the gadget collects heart rate, electrocardiograms, movement data, as well as a measure of the electrical conductance of the skin. It also detects ambient light and sound.\nThe watch isn\u2019t for sale. Instead, it an \u201cinvestigational device\u201d that will be used in clinical studies, including \u201c Baseline ,\u201d Verily\u2019s long-planned effort to discover biomarkers by tracking thousands of healthy people, including as they become ill.\nVerily is not currently seeking FDA clearance to market the watch as a medical device. \u201cIn the future, we plan to incorporate Study Watch in a broad array of health applications,\u201d the company said in a blog post .\nMIT Technology Review first spotted a version of the Googly watch in September on the wrist of Brian Otis, Verily\u2019s chief technical officer, who described it as an effort to make a more practical tracker.\nVerily, in its blog post, says although there are already many wearables on the market that the subsidiary had \u201ca specific need outside of these offerings: namely, the scalable collection of rich and complex data sets across clinical and observational studies.\u201d\nRecommended for You The Dark Secret at the Heart of AI Edible CRISPR Could Replace Antibiotics We Need More Alternatives to Facebook Engineering the Perfect Astronaut How to Pull Water Out of Thin Air, Even in the Driest Parts of the Globe The problem with most wearables is that people don\u2019t always wear them, especially bulky watches. And a tracking watch left on the dresser at home is useless. To make it user-friendly, Verily said the watch\u2019s battery will last up to a week without a charge and it will be able to store raw data produced over the same amount of time, so it doesn\u2019t have to be synched as frequently.\nThe watch has a processor that can manage and encrypt a wearer\u2019s data and its software can be updated \u201cover-the-air,\u201d Verily said.\nThe biggest technical novelty in the Study Watch appears to be its ability to collect an ECG, or electrocardiogram, which can reveal heart abnormalities. Such measurements are taken in hospitals by covering a person with a dozen glue-on electrodes. But it\u2019s also possible to pick up a lower-resolution signal from just two electrical contacts. With this watch, that apparently happens when the user grips the metal bezel with his or her other hand.\nTech companies are not widely trusted to manage health data and their efforts at consumer health products or apps have mostly tanked, or proved of little interest. Instead, they\u2019re learning that participating in research and winning over experts to act as trusted intermediaries is a better starting point.\nBeginning in 2015, for instance, Apple released frameworks for the iPhone that researchers can use to run research studies over the phone and later encouraged hospitals to start writing health-tracking apps as well. The Cupertino company\u2019s Apple Watch also measures heart rate and executives have sometimes touted cases where users were tipped off to health emergencies by unusual readings. But so far, neither Apple nor any other company has been ready to say a watch can diagnose any disease.\nIn Verily\u2019s case, the watch doesn\u2019t even let users see their health data. The only data a user sees from Google\u2019s watch is the date, time, and some instructions.\nVerily has announced wide-ranging health plans. It has teamed with partners to develop glucose sensors, self-adjusting contact lenses, bio-electronic devices, and even has a sideline in mosquito control . What most of these efforts have in common is the use of ultra-small electronics and large-scale data collection, a combination which Verily sees as its angle on health care.\nWith Study Watch, Verily says its objective is to deploy a \u201chighly scalable\u201d tool that can be used in population studies, in which thousands of people might participate.\nThe company says the watch will be used in the Personalized Parkinson\u2019s Project , a two-year study to track the progression of that disease among patients in the Netherlands. It will also be employed in its planned Baseline study, which is an attempt to closely track 10,000 to 20,000 initially healthy people over time.\nBastiaan Bloem, a neurologist who directs the Parkinson Center at Radboud University Medical Center, in the Netherlands, says the Parkinson study, to begin in June, will follow 650 volunteers with an \u201ceverything you can measure\u201d approach, including brain scans and blood tests.\nThe watch is \u201can exciting way to track people 24 hours in their homes\u201d including how badly or well people sleep, he says. No one has obtained detailed long-term sleep or heart readings on this many Parkinson\u2019s patients before. \u201cWe know one of the early symptoms in Parkinson\u2019s is heart rate variability. But we only measure it in the hospital,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd sleep is something you just can\u2019t grasp in the hospital at all.\u201d\nVerily is contributing 650 watches and cash to the $13 million study, which is also supported by Dutch government funds. Bloem says all the data will be freely available but \u201cVerily will have a crack at the data to build algorithms.\u201d\nBloem expects the data will permit classification of Parkinson\u2019s patients into sub-types who might benefit from different treatments. \u201cWe hope to get fine-grained phenotype\u2014people like you, a 50 year old man with red hair, will have this or that outcome, but only if you exercise,\u201d he says.\nBloem says patients who tested prototypes of the watch said they\u2019d be willing to keep it on, including because its looks so completely ordinary. \u201cWe work with a lot of wearables, but this one stick outs in terms of user friendliness and the look,\u201d he says.\nBecome an MIT Technology Review Insider for in-depth analysis and unparalleled perspective.\nSubscribe today", "crawled": "2017-04-14T20:00:27.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "5270d469bd82a1dcc1a4b6e7643dadf755b9464d", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 620, "likes": 620}, "gplus": {"shares": 14}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 788}}, "country": "US", "site": "technologyreview.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "https://www.technologyreview.com/", "uuid": "5270d469bd82a1dcc1a4b6e7643dadf755b9464d", "section_title": "MIT Technology Review", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 6, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4nKbDUJCUNDTMkWX8nAeKS5LhguI867DwwNYvJf_xaSC4BZFk9MnPhzLhCmdod8GVjnJmPLhfJNxzAIOYqIVW45TCRQxt_DAqWZypf3gBoTsQVQiT06wx", "domain_rank": 10416, "main_image": "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/image001.jpg?cx=0&cy=61&cw=503&ch=283&sw=1200", "site_full": "www.technologyreview.com", "title_full": "Google\u2019s Verily Unveils a Health Watch for Research - MIT Technology Review", "spam_score": 0.836, "title": "Google\u2019s Verily Unveils a Health Watch for Research", "published": "2017-04-14T03:00:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "netherlands"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cupertino"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "brian otis"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "bloem"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "bastiaan bloem"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "health watch for research verily"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "google"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "quantum computers fda"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "fda"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "apple"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "apple watch"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "facebook meet"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "radboud university medical center"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4nKbDUJCUNDTMkWX8nAeKS5LhguI867DwwNYvJf_xaSC4BZFk9MnPhzLhCmdod8GVjnJmPLhfJNxzAIOYqIVW45TCRQxt_DAqWZypf3gBoTsQVQiT06wx", "author": "technologyreview.com", "external_links": ["https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/image001.jpg?sw=850&cx=0&cy=0&cw=504&ch=356", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/image001.jpg?sw=550&cx=0&cy=0&cw=504&ch=356", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/image001.jpg?sw=1200&cx=0&cy=0&cw=504&ch=356", "https://ssl.drgnetwork.com/ecom/MTR/app/live/subscriptions?org=MTR&publ=TR&key_code=PRSV3IS&type=S", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/image001.jpg?sw=401&cx=0&cy=0&cw=504&ch=356", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/image001.jpg?sw=1700&cx=0&cy=0&cw=504&ch=356", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/image001.jpg?sw=1024&cx=0&cy=0&cw=504&ch=356", "https://blog.verily.com/", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/image001.jpg?sw=1100&cx=0&cy=0&cw=504&ch=356", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/image001.jpg?sw=2048&cx=0&cy=0&cw=504&ch=356", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/image001.jpg?sw=802&cx=0&cy=0&cw=504&ch=356", "https://verily.com/projects/precision-medicine/personalized-parkinson-project/", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/image001.jpg?sw=600&cx=0&cy=0&cw=504&ch=356"], "title": "Google\u2019s Verily Unveils a Health Watch for Research", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "New Xiaomi Mi 6 Images Leak; Xiaomi Releases New Teaser   Kristijan Lucic \nThree new Xiaomi Mi 6 images have just surfaced, and they give us a good look at the company\u2019s upcoming flagship. In addition to that, Xiaomi actually shared a new teaser for their upcoming flagship, following the one that surfaced recently and confirmed that the phone will sport a dual camera setup on the back. That being said, let\u2019s take a look at the leaked images first, shall we. \nAs you can see in the gallery down below, the Xiaomi Mi 6 will sport a home button / fingerprint scanner below its display, if this leak is legit, of course. The phone will be made out of metal and glass, and a dual camera setup on the back is also quite noticeable. Next to the rear-facing cameras, you\u2019ll notice a dual-LED, dual-tone flash which is included there. An IR blaster will be a part of the Mi 6 offering as well, which is something that it also picked up from its predecessor, the Xiaomi Mi 5. Now, this device look somewhat different compared to the leaked render that surfaced earlier today, its metal frame is shaped differently here, and it makes us wonder which one of these two designs is accurate, presuming at least one is. Now, as already mentioned, Xiaomi also released a second teaser video for their upcoming flagship, and you can check it out by clicking here . This video reveals that the Mi 6 will be curved on all four sides. Now, this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that the phone\u2019s display will be curved as it is on the Galaxy S8, it probably won\u2019t, but it could mean that it will sport a slight curve to it, as Xiaomi will probably include a 2.5D curved glass on top of the device\u2019s display. \nThe Xiaomi Mi 6 will be announced on April 19 , as the company confirmed recently, and chances are that the company plans to launch to Mi 6 devices on that date. The Xiaomi Mi 6 is said to sport a 5.15-inch fullHD display, and come in both 3GB and 6GB RAM variants. The Xiaomi Mi 6 Plus, on the other hand, will come with a 5.7-inch fullHD or QHD panel. Both devices will share the same design, and specs it seems.

The source who falsely tipped the police about a bomb is a Busan resident known as Shin, local media reports, adding that the source saw a text message received by one of their acquaintances according to which two North Koreans were looking to plant a bomb in the building. The contents of the message were written in English while the message itself was allegedly sent on Tuesday, but no other details on the matter have been disclosed by the investigators. \nFollowing the false tip, authorities evacuated approximately 3,000 employees of Samsung Life Insurance and conducted an extensive search of the building. No people have been harmed and no property damaged during the ordeal, local police said, adding that they\u2019re currently in the process of tracking down the source of the false report that cost Samsung a significant number of wasted man-hours. It remains to be seen whether the South Korean company will comment on the matter, but no official statements regarding the ordeal have yet been made on Samsung\u2019s part. \nSamsung Life Insurance is a Seoul-based insurance company owned by Samsung Group, the largest business conglomerate in South Korea. In addition to being the biggest firm of its kind in the Far Eastern country, Samsung Life Insurance has also been a Fortune Global 500 company for many years now.

On the back of this device, you\u2019ll get two camera sensors, and we\u2019re looking at 16-megapixel and 8-megapixel camera shooters here. A 5.5-inch AMOLED display will be included on the front side of this smartphone, and even though we still don\u2019t know its resolution, we\u2019re presuming this will be a fullHD (1920 x 1080) panel.

The upcoming variant of the device is expected to sport the model number SM-G892A, one that hasn\u2019t yet been mentioned in any previous reports, including certificates issued by the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Due to that state of affairs, it seems unlikely that the second largest wireless carrier in the country will start selling the Galaxy S8 Active as soon as the regular variants of the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus launch. Naturally, that assumption is also reinforced by the fact that the Dallas, Texas-based mobile service provider hasn\u2019t made any official announcements on the matter so far, which probably wouldn\u2019t be the case if the device was slated to be released next week. \nThe original report also reveals that the Galaxy S8 Active is codenamed \u201cCruiser,\u201d speculating how that name could imply it will carry a larger battery than the regular device as that ship classification denotes vessels designed for traversing distant waters. Regardless of whether that speculation turns out to be baseless or not, sources with direct knowledge of the matter claim that the Galaxy S8 Active will be hitting the market in the near future. The device itself will likely be made in accordance with the MIL-STD-810G military standard, though it remains to be seen whether it will feature a dedicated Active button like previous Active-branded revisions of Samsung\u2019s flagships did. Seeing how the Galaxy S8 already boasts four physical buttons on its sides, Samsung may decide against including the fifth one and could instead simply remap the Bixby button or offer users the choice to do so themselves. \nWhile the report doesn\u2019t specifically state this, it seems likely that AT&T will only retail an Active variant of the 5.8-inch Galaxy S8, while the 6.2-inch Galaxy S8 Plus won\u2019t get the same treatment, just like last year when Samsung only released an AT&T-exclusive Galaxy S7 Active. More details on the device are expected to follow later this year.

The consumer insights firm found that Samsung\u2019s 2014 smartphone still accounts for more than 15 percent of the company\u2019s install base in the country, with the Galaxy S7 placing second and boasting an 11.5-percent share of the thereof. Those two models were followed by the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S7 Edge who account for 11.4 and 5.8 percent of Samsung\u2019s U.S. install base, respectively. In the last year, more than one-quarter of U.S. consumers who owned a Samsung smartphone upgraded to a new handset made by the company, latest industry data reveals. Over half of those people upgraded to the Galaxy S7 and the Galaxy S7 Edge, meaning around 14 percent of Samsung\u2019s existing customers in the country are unlikely to purchase the upcoming Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus at launch, Kantar speculates. \nThe company\u2019s report also reflects the huge diversity of products that Samsung is offering in the U.S. seeing how almost half of Samsung\u2019s customers in the country who recently purchased a new Galaxy phone opted for one of 48 different models. While entry-level and mid-range devices are characterized by significantly thinner profit margins than flagship handsets, there\u2019s still a lot of strength in numbers and Samsung is seemingly aware of that fact seeing how the company is adamant to keep its product lineup as varied as possible. Ultimately, the Seoul-based consumer electronics manufacturer is putting a larger focus on keeping consumers withing its product ecosystem than on trying to convince them to purchase the most expensive Galaxy-branded devices, despite the fact that Samsung\u2019s marketing spending recently reached a historic high and most of its promotional efforts are aimed at its premium products. \nRegardless, the company recently introduced a wide variety of new devices, including several variants of the Galaxy Tab S3, a revised version of the Gear VR headset, and a new smartphone lineup, all of which are meant to provide consumers with more choice than ever, as long as their choice is to continue purchasing Samsung products. This approach is how Samsung intends to continue growing in the increasingly saturated consumer electronics market, though it remains to be seen whether its current strategy proves to be effective in the long term.

In a recent interview with Typeform , Bennett delved even deeper into her history with Apple and the early days of its virtual assistant. In the interview, which is dotted with audio playback of Bennett's voice so readers can compare her normal voice to that of Siri, the voice actress remembers recording a new project in July of 2005 for a text-to-speech company called ScanSoft. The project was said to be for a phone-messaging system, but it turns out it was the basis for what would become Siri, two years before the original iPhone even came out. Bennett's job during that summer was to recite \"nonsense phrases\" that made little to no sense. A few years ago, the voice actor behind the Siri male voice, Daniel, described the same work process when he was employed by ScanSoft. ScanSoft eventually merged with Nuance, which powers the voices and speech recognition abilities of Siri . A few of Bennett's lines included: \u201cMalitia oi hallucinate, buckry ockra ooze, Cathexis fefatelly sexual ease stump, Say the shrodding again, say the shroding again, say the shreeding again, say the shriding again, say the shrading again, say the shrudding again.\u201d \u201cWe were recording for a text-to-speech company. And this was brand new to us. We had no real idea of what we were doing. We thought we were doing new scripts for phone systems.\u201d Bennett said she was paid an hourly wage, and refused a five-year contract that was eventually offered to her when the job was done, mentioning that constantly using a monotone voice day-in and day-out was \"the complete opposite of creative.\" Only later did she realize that every odd phrase provided Apple with \"all of the sounds of the English language,\" allowing the company to go in and \"reform them into new phrases and sentences,\" and eventually craft what would become known today as Siri. The origin of Siri's name is also explained, with Bennett stating that Dag Kittlaus -- a co-creator of Siri who has now left Apple to found Viv -- had originally planned to name his daughter Siri. His wife eventually ended up having a boy, so Kittlaus used the girl's name for Apple's smartphone assistant instead. \u201cIn Norwegian the word Siri means \u201cbeautiful woman who guides you to victory.\u201d Of course we know better, she\u2019s the feisty chick who tells you where to go, right. But, Dag and his wife were expecting a child, they thought it was going to be a girl, and they planned to name her Siri. But when the baby arrived it was a boy. So they gave the name to the app instead. And that\u2019s where Siri got her name.\u201d Eventually, Bennett discovered that she was the voice of the ever-present voice assistant in the iPhone beginning in October 2011, and admitted that \"it was a little creepy.\" She decided to stay quiet about her role for two years, finally revealing herself in a CNN interview in 2013. That same year, Apple ended up removing all of Bennett's voice work from Siri and replacing her with someone else within the completely redesigned iOS 7 update. The original Siri in iOS 5 Bennett said that everything has worked out for the best, because her work as the original Siri has opened up aspects of her career that she never imagined, including introducing Steve Wozniak at the 2013 Dallas Digital Summit and even giving a TED Talk in 2016. Because of this, she harbors no ill will towards Apple and the secretive methods the company used when creating Siri. \u201cI kind of got the best of both worlds because I was the original, and I do get to promote myself, and when Siri starts leading us all into the sea it won\u2019t be my voice.\u201d The full interview on Typeform is well worth a read, as it goes back to detail Bennett's career beginnings as the voice of an ATM named Tillie in the 1970s, and delves into how Apple's programmers created Siri's personality from Bennett's original voice work. The article also looks to the future of virtual assistants and what the AI helpers might look like in next-generation smartphones .", "crawled": "2017-04-14T18:04:48.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-14T18:04:48.000+03:00", "uuid": "727878588949894ffd0affb0dda0f27b36bb3379", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 559, "likes": 559}, "gplus": {"shares": 6}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 34}}, "country": "US", "site": "macrumors.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://feeds.macrumors.com/MacRumors-All", "uuid": "727878588949894ffd0affb0dda0f27b36bb3379", "section_title": "MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 5, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTT_S6x0widpmkY8apq3v3WLdohCKqqpmyyeH9IPuaWwoY9VLIGegoADIv4LLPkugVp2YKAdsc81U1LN.kaYs.K", "domain_rank": 1213, "main_image": "https://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2017/04/susan-bennett-siri.jpg?retina", "site_full": "www.macrumors.com", "title_full": "Siri Voice Actress Susan Bennett Reveals More Details About the Origins of Apple's Virtual Assistant", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Siri Voice Actress Susan Bennett Reveals More Details About the Origins of Apple's Virtual Assistant", "published": "2017-04-14T18:04:48.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "susan bennett"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "tillie"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "viv"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "bennett"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "mitchel broussard"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dag kittlaus"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "siri"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "daniel"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dag"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kittlaus"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "steve wozniak"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "apple"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "siri voice actress"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "scansoft"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cnn"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dallas digital summit"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTT_S6x0widpmkY8apq3v3WLdohCKqqpmyyeH9IPuaWwoY9VLIGegoADIv4LLPkugVp2YKAdsc81U1LN.kaYs.K", "author": "Mitchel Broussard", "external_links": [], "title": "Siri Voice Actress Susan Bennett Reveals More Details About the Origins of Apple's Virtual Assistant", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "The time has finally come: Microsoft is dropping the banhammer on mixing modern processors with classic Windows operating systems.\nUsers are reporting their Windows 7 and 8.1 PCs with Kaby Lake and Ryzen processors are being blocked from receiving updates, according to Ars Technica and Tech Report .\nThat means all updates, including security updates, will be unavailable on PCs with brand new hardware running the two older operating systems.

This does indicate that the Mi 6 will be a powerful device, however, it all depends on what the final product turns out to be. \nThe Xiaomi Mi 6 is set to launch on April 19 , and specifications and price of the device have already been leaked. From what we know so far , the Xiaomi Mi 6 runs on Android 7.1.1 Nougat, and will feature a 5.1-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixel) display. It is tipped to offer 64GB or 128GB of inbuilt storage as well. As for camera, the Mi 6 is tipped to sport a 12-megapixel rear camera and an 8-megapixel front snapper. Meanwhile, the Mi 6 Plus flagship has been tipped to sport a Quad HD 2K OLED display with dual curved edges and dual rear camera setup, while the Mi 6 will allegedly sport a flat display. Both the flagships are expected to come with Qualcomm's Quick Charge 4.0 technology for fast charging support. The smartphone is also expected to house a 4000mAh battery, although this will likely be for the Mi 6 Plus. \nXiaomi Mi 6 will allegedly be launched in 4GB of RAM + 64GB storage and 4GB + 128GB variants priced at CNY 2,199 (roughly Rs. 20,500), and CNY 2,599 (roughly Rs. 24,300), respectively. The bigger Xiaomi Mi 6 Plus, on the other hand is tipped to be be offered in 6GB of RAM + 64GB, 6GB + 128GB, and 6GB + 256GB variants, which will reportedly be priced at CNY 2,699 (roughly Rs. 25,000), CNY 3,099 (roughly Rs. 28,990) and CNY 3,699 (roughly Rs. 34,600), respectively.

Disney had ruled out any use of visual effects, like it did on Rogue One , and after talks with Fisher\u2019s family, it has been given permission to use existing footage from The Force Awakens , and The Last Jedi . \nOn Monday, Marvel dropped the first trailer for Thor\u2019s third standalone outing. The Asgardian demi-god loses his hammer to the new villain Hela (Cate Blanchett), is thrown out of his own kingdom, and gets kidnapped by misfits that deliver him to the planet Sakaar, which is ruled by the Grandmaster (Jeff Goldblum). Oh, did we mention he meets the Hulk? Thor: Ragnarok opens November 3. \nThat very day, Netflix released a trailer for the second season of Sense8, the Wachowski\u2019s latest project. It\u2019ll follow the eight inter-connected individuals, and will be available in its entirety on the streaming service come May 5. \nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 , the next chapter in Marvel\u2019s ever-expanding saga , is out May 5 worldwide. That much is known. And thanks to director James Gunn, we know the film\u2019s soundtrack will be available a week before, on April 28. Good news for everyone who loved the music for the first film (that includes us). \nOn Wednesday, a teaser trailer for EA\u2019s Star Wars Battlefront II leaked on the Internet. It showed a campaign mode that\u2019s been rumoured, with the player being a solider for the Empire. The multiplayer action, meanwhile, will likely span all eras of Star Wars. It\u2019s been pulled down since, and the official one will be up on Saturday. \nLater that day, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Josh Brolin had been signed to play the role of Cable opposite Ryan Reynolds\u2019 Deadpool in the upcoming sequel. David Leitch is directing Deadpool 2, which is scheduled for a 2018 release. \nAnd on the same day, THR also broke the casting news for Fantastic Beasts 2 \u2013 Jude Law has been brought on board to play young Albus Dumbledore, opposite [ spoiler alert ] Johnny Depp as Gellert Grindelwald, who spent the film disguised as Colin Farrell. The sequel will be set in Paris and parts of England. The film arrives November 16, 2018. \nThat\u2019s all the entertainment news for this week. Welcome back to The Weekend Chill , your one-stop destination for what to watch, play, or listen to this weekend. Here are the best picks: \nTV: Mystery Science Theater 3000: The Return After a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter that generated over $6 million, the revival of the cult hit show has finally arrived on Netflix . Sadly, not for everyone. It will only be available in the US, Canada, UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. Hopefully, Netflix will figure out deals with local TV networks soon enough. \nThe show does retain many of its favourite elements \u2013 you\u2019ve got the human subject (Jonah Ray) stuck in the Satellite of Love, forced to watch a series of B-movies chosen by two mad scientists \u2013 Felicia Day, and Patton Oswalt \u2013 on the ground below. Except this time, their base is on the Moon, yep. \nTo keep Ray company, and help riff on the films\u2019 terribleness, he\u2019s got three robot companions \u2013 Tom Servo, Crow T. Robot, and Gypsy. The terrible movie for the first episode is Reptilicus (1961). There will still be \u2018commercial breaks\u2019 despite being on Netflix, and there will even be cameos from the likes of Jerry Seinfeld, Joel McHale, Neil Patrick Harris, and more. \nHow to access: Netflix The Gadgets 360 Spring 2017 TV Guide \nBetter Call Saul With this Breaking Bad spin-off, co-creators Vince Gillian and Peter Gould picked up the critical acclaim where they left off with the parent\u2019s final season. The show\u2019s second season [ spoiler alert ] ended with a dual cliff-hanger. On one side, Chuck (Michael McKean) staged a scene to get Jimmy (Bob Odenkirk) to confess to a felony. \nOn the other, Mike (Jonathan Banks) is after the cartel boss Hector Salamanca (Mark Margolis), who\u2019s not yet in the wheelchair Bad fans remember him for. But after an invisible intervention, he\u2019s forced to find the person who seems to know a lot about his work, with the start of the third season. \nJimmy, meanwhile, is slowly devolving into the character we better know him by: Saul Goodman. As Chuck launches an inquest, Jimmy, and Kim\u2019s law practice \u2013 and their romance \u2013 are set to be severely tested. Along the way, we\u2019ll learn more about their backstories with nods to the Breaking Bad universe. \nHow to access: AMC Monday 10pm ET, or Colors Infinity Tuesday 7pm ISTTime commitment: 45 minutes, weekly \nThe Leftovers After a mediocre first season, creator Damon Lindelof gave the show a soft reboot with the second season\u2019s premiere. The show imagines a future where 2 per cent of the world\u2019s population \u2013 about 140 million people \u2013 vanished overnight. Except one small town was spared in eastern Texas, with a population of over 9,000 people. \nThe Leftovers is focused on two families: the Garveys, and the Murphys, and what they witness after the Departure that shook the world. The third and final season, beginning this Sunday in the US, will wrap up their storylines. Lindelof was an Emmy winner on Lost, which has become infamous for its terrible ending, but he seems to have cooked up a genuine winner here, according to early reviews. \nThe new episodes concoct \u201ca wild narrative with ambitious new threads\u201d, according to Indiewire\u2019s Ben Travers, that hones in on the characters\u2019 \u201cfundamental spiritual and psychological beliefs\u201d. It looks set to be an emotionally devastating ending, so buckle up. \nHow to access: HBO Sunday 9pm ET, or Hotstar Time commitment: 1 hour, weekly \nVeep After a five-season arc that has taken her from senator, to Vice President, and ultimately the US President, Selina Meyer (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) finds herself in the most uncomfortable of situations. She\u2019s been kicked out of the White House, thanks to a recount \u2013 and other tragedies \u2013 that didn\u2019t go in her favour. \nHer trusted entourage (okay, that\u2019s a lie) has dispersed following the calamity, with only Gary (Tony Hale) remaining by her side. Mike (Matt Walsh) soon joins in too, what with having to deal with three kids back home. Selina, meanwhile, grapples with being outside the spotlight, and doing her best to stay in it, where she loves herself. \nThe sixth season won\u2019t focus much on real-life politics, because Veep was shot in June, when America\u2019s future was still up for grabs. Instead, it\u2019s created an alternate reality for itself, Louis-Dreyfus said in an interview. Early reviews say it\u2019s as good as always, with every cast member performing to their maximum capabilities. \nHow to access: HBO Sunday 10:30pm ET, or Hotstar Time commitment: 30 minutes, weekly \nMovies: Fast and Furious 8 On the back of the franchise\u2019s first billion-dollar entry, F. Gary Gray (The Italian Job, Straight Outta Compton) takes over the Fast and Furious series for the eighth instalment, which will be the first since Tokyo Drift without Paul Walker, after the actor\u2019s death in a car accident midway through filming of Furious 7. The rest of the ensemble returns as expected, with new additions in Scott Eastwood, Charlize Theron, and a cameo from Helen Mirren. \nThe Fate of the Furious \u2013 Universal\u2019s rebranding of Fast and Furious 8 \u2013 picks up where the last one left off, with Dom (Vin Diesel) and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) honeymooning in Cuba. After a mysterious hacker named Cipher (Theron) shows up with blackmail material, Dom helps her steal some heavy-duty weapons. Now, the gang is forced to go up against one of their own. \nIt\u2019s not a great movie, overall, but loyalists probably won\u2019t care. For the rest, we\u2019ve got a detailed review that delves into what the film does wrong, so you should read that before you fork over the money for tickets. \nHow to access: Out in cinema hallsTime commitment: 2 hours and 16 minutes \nHidden Figures Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Mon\u00e1e star in this true story about African-American women who worked as \u201ccomputers\u201d \u2013 that is performed mathematical calculations \u2013 for the engineers at NASA, and helped them in the 60s Space Race against the then-USSR. Henson plays Katherine G. Johnson \u2013 a Presidential Medal of Freedom awardee \u2013 who calculated flight trajectories for Project Mercury, the US\u2019 first programme to put a man in space. \nThe film, directed by Theodore Melfi, is based on Margot Lee Shetterly\u2019s non-fiction book of the same name, which hit the top position on The New York Times\u2019 non-fiction best sellers list. Its cinematic adaptation has received tons of praise too \u2013 it was nominated for three Oscars, including Best Picture. \nHidden Figures also stars the likes of Kevin Costner, Kirsten Dunst, Jim Parsons, and Mahershala Ali. Hans Zimmer provided background score for the film. \nTime commitment: 2 hours and 7 minutes \nToni Erdmann Directed by Maren Ade, Toni Edrmann is follow-up to her 2010 film Everyone Else, which premiered at Cannes last year, and was an Oscar nominee in the foreign language category. It\u2019s about a father-daughter relationship between Winfried (Peter Simonischek) and his forever-busy daughter Ines (Sandra H\u00fcller). \nAfter Winfried\u2019s old dog dies, he decides to surprise her at her place of work in Bucharest. But it doesn\u2019t go too well. While Ines is trying to make a mark, Winfried likes to play practical jokes, and deliver jabs at her lifestyle. Eventually, he agrees to return home to Germany. But a day later, Winfried is back as Toni Erdmann, disguised in a weird wig and fake teeth. \nHe claims to the life coach for Ines\u2019 CEO, and barges into her professional life. It\u2019s a comedy film, so it\u2019s all about the madness that ensues from there on. \nTime commitment: 2 hours and 42 minutes \nLion Based on the non-fiction book A Long Way Home by Saroo Brierley with Larry Buttrose, and written for the screen by Luke Davies, Lion tells the story of a five-year-old Indian boy who gets lost on a train, and ends up somewhere far away \u2013 Kolkata. Saroo is eventually adopted by an Australian couple, and returns to India 25 years late to find his lost family, and home. \nThe film is divided into two tonally-opposite halves \u2013 the first looks at the young boy, and the terror he faces after separating from his family. The second, as an adult \u2013 played by Dev Patel \u2013 focuses on his resilience, determination, and courage to find what he lost, with the help of a technology called Google Earth. \nGarth Davis makes his directorial debut with the film, and even though Lion borrows from genre clich\u00e9s, and feels like Oscar bait, it\u2019s still a moving story. Lion had six nominations at the Oscars, and won two BAFTAs \u2013 Supporting Actor (Patel), and Screenplay.", "crawled": "2017-04-14T13:56:14.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-14T13:56:14.000+03:00",

 \u00a9 Richard Gunion | Dreamstime.com \nEaster is this Sunday. While some of you will be hiding Easter eggs and waiting for the Easter Bunny to deliver Easter baskets with all sorts of candy and goodies, it's important to remember the real reason behind the holiday. \nThe Easter holiday honors the day that Jesus Christ was resurrected after his crucifixion. You can learn more details about this amazing story with the following five sites dedicated to the Bible and other Christian writings and teachings. \nOnline Parallel Bible - The Bible has been translated thousands, if not millions, of times and into almost every language imaginable. Have you ever wondered what the differences were? \nThe Online Parallel Bible will tell you. This site allows you to view the Bible in different languages and translations. \nSearch by verse or topic and you will find each version of the text according to which version of the Bible it is from. You can also access lessons, sermons, a Bible timeline, and look at commentaries. \nYou can read the Easter story in French, German, Hebrew or English. Just type \"Mark 16:1-8\" in the search bar for the whole story. \nEarly Christian Writings - The Bible isn't just one book - it's composed of 66 different books. However, the New Testament only represents a fraction of other contemporary church writings. \nThis site is devoted to telling those untold stories. Just search for Easter in the search bar in the top right-hand corner. \nCodex Sinaiticus - Check out this site to view the Codex Sinaiticus - the oldest and most complete version of the New Testament. It's more than 1,600 years old and has been digitized for everyone to enjoy. \nBible Geocoding - The Bible dates back thousands of years, so it's no surprise that many of the given geographic names are outdated. This can make it difficult to visualize places, landmarks and distances. \nThis site allows you to overlay Bible geographic information on to Google Maps.

Unfortunately, any halfway dedicated sneak with a little technology can get past your doors and curtains to see everything going on in your house. \nNo, we're not talking about X-ray vision, thermal cameras or millimeter wave scanners. It's something a lot less expensive, and the peeper doesn't even have to buy it; it's already in your home. \nWe are, of course, talking about your computer's webcam. There have been plenty of news stories over the years about pervert hackers spying on women and even kids in their bedrooms.

The tweet only says, \"India, get ready to #UnboxYourPhone! Samsung #GalaxyS8 #GalaxyS8Plus, India launch on 19th April, 2017,\" without giving any indication as to the Galaxy S8 price in India and release date. \nIt's worth noting that the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are already up for pre-registrations in India. We can expect to get clarity on the availability and pricing of the phones at the launch event. Samsung Galaxy S8 India variant \nIn India, the company will launch the Samsung Exynos 8895 SoC-based variants of the smartphones, and not the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC variants that are limited to select regions like the US. However, this should not be too much of an issue, as some benchmarks show Samsung's chip to outperform Qualcomm's . Samsung Galaxy S8 price in India \nSamsung is yet to officially announce the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ pricing details. Soon after March 29 launch , Verizon Wireless had the lowest rates, at $720 (roughly Rs. 46,700) for the Galaxy S8 and $840 (roughly Rs. 54,500) for the Galaxy S8+. Prices go up to $750 (roughly Rs. 48,700) and $850 (roughly Rs. 55,200) respectively. We can expect the India pricing of the handsets to be around the US pricing. Samsung's Galaxy S8 will be going on sale in South Korea, the United States and Canada from April 21. Samsung Galaxy S8 features \nFor Samsung, the new premium phones are claimed to bring the \"start of a new era.\" The Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ will debut the company's in-house voice-based virtual assistant named Bixby which will be taking on other voice-based virtual assistants powered by artificial intelligence including Apple's Siri, Google Assistant, Microsoft Cortana and Amazon's Alexa. The Galaxy S8 will come with a set of pre-installed apps that will work with Bixby. The South Korean company however has confirmed that the AI-powered assistant's Voice feature will be missing from the phones at the global launch on April 21. \nSome of the highlights of the Galaxy S8 is the iris recognition while the company also introduced its Microsoft Continuum-like feature, Samsung DeX, which will let users use smartphone like a computer by docking it to monitor, keyboard, and mouse. Similar to the Galaxy S7, the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ are dust and water resistant with IP68 certification.

They can let you capture breathtaking footage, some in high-resolution 4K video. They're also more affordable than ever, as quality beginner models now cost less than $60. Good camera drones start at a few hundred dollars.\nMore complex drones, starting at less than $1,000, offer customizable and programmable features, turning them into truly autonomous devices that can make their own decisions. Plus, a new class of racing drones has started hitting the scene.\nWe've tested dozens of drones, evaluating them based on design, ease of use, camera quality, durability and flight time, to bring you our list of top picks.\nLatest Drone News DJI announced the Phantom 4 Advanced ($1,349), which features a 1-inch 20MP sensor that can shoot video at 4K/60 fps and take 14MP still images. It's the same camera as found in the premium Phantom 4 Pro ($1,499), but the Advanced model lacks rear vision sensors, and its remote does not support the 5.8GHz band found in the Pro model.\nAfter a faulty launch which saw some of its drones falling from the sky , GoPro is once again selling its Karma drone. The company said that a faulty battery latch caused some of its drones to abruptly lose power mid-flight. In a statement on its website, GoPro said that it redesigned the latch to ensure the battery stays in. The Karma is available for $799, or $1,099 with a GoPro Hero5 Black camera.\nAmong all the drones that arrived over the holidays, the Propel Star Wars drones generated the most excitement. Three models are available: An X-Wing fighter, a TIE Interceptor, and a speeder bike. Each cost $239, and can do battle with each other via built-in IR blasters (an optional upgrade to actual lasers\u2014which look awesome\u2014is coming later). The drones, which are hand-painted, come in a Collector's Edition display box, which lights up and starts playing the Star Wars theme when opened. \nAlso check out the $749 DJI Mavic Pro , another folding drone that comes with a 4K camera, and our current favorite camera drone, which you can control using nothing more than hand gestures. \n3D Robotics (3DR) is no longer selling a consumer version of the 3DR Solo (our current top pick for pros), but will continue to support the consumer model for the foreseeable future, and is still providing a one-year hardware warranty. As a result, it's pretty inexpensive, even when you factor in the cost of a GoPro camera. Get it while supplies last.\nRead on to see our choices for different types of flying and budgets. Below our recommendations, you can find our tips on shopping for a drone and what rules you need to follow .\nEditor's choice UDI U818A Best Drone for Beginners 9/10 Superior \nReview $89.90 Amazon Flight Time 8 minutes Camera 0.3 megapixels, 30 fps Smartphone Controlled No FAA Registration Not Required Indoor Use No Rotors 4 (2 blades per rotor, replaceable) Size 16.1 x 16.1 x 2.4 inches Weight 4.6 ounces Learning to fly a drone begins with learning how not to crash. That process begins with mishaps, so an aspiring pilot needs a drone that is tough, but also cheap enough that losing it in a tree won't bankrupt them. The $47.99 UDI U818A has a great range of features for the price, and it's easy to fly. The four-loop style frame protects the large rotors in crashes, and the rotors are cheap (under $3 a set) and easy to replace if they don't survive. A bonus for beginners is the included 640 x 480-pixel video camera attached to the body. It won't produce the work of Stanley Kubrick, but it will give you a whole new outlook on flying. \nEditor's choice Parrot Bebop 2 Best Simple Video Drone 8/10 Totally worth it \nReview $649 Amazon Flight Time 23 minutes Camera 14 megapixels, 30 fps Smartphone Controlled Optional FAA Registration Required Indoor Use No Rotors 4 (3 blades per rotor, replaceable) Size 13 x 12 x 4 inches Weight 17 ounces The Parrot Bebop 2 takes quality in-flight video. The phone- or tablet-based controls make it intuitive to control right out of the box, even if it lacks a little of the sensitivity of a more expensive drone with a separate controller. The $649 package includes not just the drone, but a controller and FPV goggles, so you can get a drone's-eye view of all the action.\nAxis Aerius Drone Best Miniature Drone 8/10 Totally worth it \nReview $30 Aerix Flight Time 5 minutes Camera No Smartphone Controlled No FAA Registration Not Required Indoor Use Yes Rotors 4 (2 blades per rotor, replaceable) Size 1.2 x 1.2 x 0.8 inches Weight 0.3 ounces At $35, the Axis Aerius drone offers a whole lot of fun for very little money. It's ridiculously cute and is about the same size as a quarter, earning it the moniker of the world's smallest quadcopter (according to the company). Aspiring drone pilots will appreciate the four, bright LED lights that make it fun to fly even at night. The remote control features a plastic dome that makes keeping track of this little guy super easy.\nEditor's choice Aerix Black Talon 2.0 Best Racing Drone for Beginners 8/10 Totally worth it \nReview $115.00 Aerix Flight Time 4 minutes Camera 720p/1280 x 720 pixels Smartphone Controlled Optional FAA Registration Not required Indoor Use No Rotors 4 (2 blades per, replaceable) 2.75-inch diameter Size 7 x 7 x 2 inches Weight 2.5 ounces The second version of the Aerix Black Talon features a much-improved camera. This makes for an even more immersive experience with the included FPV goggles, which drive home that in-the-action feeling as you zip around a track. Aspiring racers will love this drone's speed and maneuverability, and that it's super-easy to learn to fly. However, you'll want to spring for the optional battery pack, as this drone's endurance is a very short 4 minutes.\nEditor's choice DJI Mavic Pro Best Camera Drone 9/10 Superior \nReview $999 Amazon Flight Time 22 minutes Camera 12 megapixels Smartphone Controlled Optional FAA Registration Required Indoor Use No Rotors 4 (2 blades per rotor, replaceable) Size 7.8 x 3.4 x 3.4 Weight 1.6 pounds Made for outdoor adventurers, the Mavic Pro folds up to fit into a space no larger than 8 inches long and 3.5 inches deep. Yet once you extend its four rotors, it can fly for up to 23 minutes, as you control it either with your smartphone, a remote control, or even by waving your hands. Gesture recognition means you can stow the controller in your bag, and still have the Mavic Pro follow you down \u2014 or up \u2014 the mountain, and get just the right shot from its excellent 4K/30fps camera. A bevy of sensors and flight modes keep the drone right where you want it, no matter where you are. The Mavic Pro starts at $749, but costs $999 with the controller.\nBlade Nano QX RTF Best Drone Under $100 8/10 Totally worth it \nReview $79.99 Amazon Flight Time 8 minutes Camera No Smartphone Controlled No FAA Registration Not Required Indoor Use Yes Rotors 4 (2 blades per rotor, replaceable) Size 5.5 x 5.5 x 2 inches Weight 0.6 ounces So you've bought a cheap drone, learned how to fly, and want more. The Blade Nano QX is for you, offering a great selection of features for the flier who wants more without spending too much. Prices start under $100 for the basic, no-frills Blade Nano QX RTF model, and go over $300 for the Nano QX FPV RTF model, which includes a first-person-view headset that shows you the drone's perspective of the world. The Blade QX is faster and more maneuverable than cheaper models, but won't break the bank if you do happen to misjudge the top of a tree and get it stuck out of reach.\nBest for Sci-Fi Fans Propel Star Wars T-65 X-Wing 8/10 Totally worth it \nReview $239 Brookstone The force has awakened with Propel's new Star Wars drones, including the X-Wing, a TIE Interceptor, and an Imperial speeder bike (complete with Stormtrooper). All the drones are outfitted with IR blasters and receivers, so you can do battle with each other. The drones' controllers play a number of sound effects and music from the Star Wars movies. Each drone is hand-painted and numbered, too. Only a limited number will be released in 2016.\nEditor's choice 3D Robotics Solo Best Drone for Pros 8/10 Totally worth it \nReview $399 Amazon Flight Time 22 minutes Camera Not included Smartphone Controlled Optional FAA Registration Required Indoor Use No Rotors 4 (2 blades per rotor, replaceable) Size 18.5 x 1.8 x 0.7 feet Weight 3.35 pounds When you add on the 4K GoPro camera and optional gimbal, the 3D Robotics' Solo camera drone isn't cheap. But, the controller and app are better than the competition. The design is clean. Plus, it's easier to fly, thanks to a more responsive remote and top-of-the-line flight modes. It can even fly autonomously. The open-source nature of the company means this is the drone for tinkerers and hackers. \nNew & Notable Drones New & Notable Kudrone $99 Indiegogo Flight Time 8 minutes Camera 4K (3820 x 2464) Smartphone Controlled Yes FAA Registration No Rotors 4 Size 6.8 x 6.8 x 1.3 inches Weight 3 ounces Another flying selfie drone, the Kudrone fits in the palm of your hand (it measures 6.8 x 6.8 x 1.3 inches), yet is equipped with a camera with a 13MP sensor that can shoot 4K video. With GPS, sonar, and an accelerometer, it can also auto-track your movements and take panoramas. Its 650mAh battery has a short flight time of 8 minutes, but can be swapped out easily. The Kudrone is available through Indiegogo for $99, but the retail price will be $189 when it hits shelves this summer. \nNew & Notable Parrot Disco Review $1,299 Amazon Flight Time 45 minutes Camera 720p (1280x720) Smartphone Controlled Optional FAA Registration Required Rotors 1 Rear Size 45 x 22 inches Weight 1.6 pounds Parrot\u2019s Disco already stands out from the quadcopter drone crowd by going with a single-wing design. (There is a lone propeller at the rear of the drone.) Instead of hovering, this drone circles \u2014 at least when it\u2019s not flying at 50 mph speeds. But the real star of the show is a headset included with the Disco that lets you watch the 720p video captured by the drone\u2019s 14-megapixel camera like you were sitting in the cockpit.\nNew & Notable PowerVision PowerEgg Review $1,288 PowerVision Flight Time 23 Minutes Camera 4K/30 fps Smartphone Controlled Optional FAA Registration Required Rotors 4 (10.5 inches) Size 10.7 x 6.9 inch diameter Weight 4.6 pounds The ovular design of this drone is not just for looks. The PowerEgg's rotors and landing struts fold up inside when not in use, protecting its most vital parts for transportation. Its legs automatically retract when in flight, so that the 4K camera has an unimpeded view when recording. Aside from a traditional joystick, the PowerEgg also comes with a one-handed motion controller, for a Wii-like experience. \nSee Also : 15 Places To Fly Drones In The Northeast \nWhat You Need to Know Before You Buy and Fly Drones aren't that complicated, but there are a few key features you should consider when you are shopping. There are also some key rules you need to follow when you take to the air.\nLegal Requirements \nFAA has rules you have to follow. The most important two: Never fly around or above people, and always keep your drone in sight. The FAA has a full list of safety guidelines for model aircraft that you should check before you take off. There are also restrictions on where you can fly: For example, within 5 miles of an airport is off limits. Mapbox provides a great interactive map of no-fly areas , and local RC (Remote Control) aircraft clubs may list fields that they use.\nMany drones also must be registered before they are put in the air. The online process for registering costs $5, and applies to any drone that weighs between 0.55 pounds and 55 pounds. That covers about half of our favorite drones. Once you register, you get a unique serial number that needs to be applied to all your drones, and when you're flying you'll need to have a paper or electronic copy of your certificate of registration. Drones registration has to be renewed every 3 years. Failure to register can cost you up to $250,000 or result in 3 years of jail time.\nMORE: 100 Places to Fly a Drone in America \n\nDrone Controls \nMost drones use a remote control with two joysticks \u2014 a bit like an Xbox or PlayStation controller . One stick controls what's called the attitude of the quadcopter, including roll (tilting left and right) and pitch (tilting up and down). The other stick controls throttle and the rotation of the quadcopter. A good remote control should fit well in the hand, with sticks resting comfortably under your thumbs and providing a smooth, responsive feel that allows you to guide the quadcopter by touch.\nSome models skip the remote control, or offer it as an extra-cost feature, and instead use a smartphone connected via Wi-Fi and a flying app. These apps often provide a live video view from the quadcopter camera. However, apps don\u2019t allow the precision of real controllers: It is easier for your thumbs to slip, possibly causing a crash. \nConstruction and Repair \nDespite what the ads tell you, drones crash all the time. A good drone will take an unplanned descent and ground interface (aka: a crash) in stride, without damaging the frame. It will also include shields to protect the rotors and electronics from harm.\nRegardless, things still get broken sometimes, particularly racing drones . A good model will offer a ready supply of cheap parts like rotors and struts to replace the broken ones, and will make it easy to swap these parts out when required. The same is true of batteries. \nBatteries \nVery few drones offer more than 10 to 20 minutes of battery life, so an easily swapped battery can give you more flying time without hassle. This tends to be a feature of more expensive models, with a spare battery typically costing more than $100. Cheap drones (under about $400) usually have built-in batteries that can't be swapped out. \nCamera \nWant to show off your aerial exploits? A camera, either built-in or add-on, can capture those dramatic vistas for posterity. Most budget models use the equivalent of a cheap webcam, capturing low-resolution video (usually 640 x 480-pixel resolution) to an internal memory card for later viewing. \nMore sophisticated models offer high-definition video capture or the ability to connect an HD action camera such as a GoPro. Some drones also offer first-person view (FPV), sending a pilot's-eye view from the drone itself to a phone or tablet. Some models offer video goggles for the ultimate pilot-seat flying experience. \nDo you still have questions about drones? Or opinions about what does and doesn't belong on this list?

It would be great for beginners if not for it's size and mass, but other than that it is very affordable at ($70-100), very stable, easy to fly, has a cam, headless mode, and best of all it is very tough. I have crashed mine many many times and some times very hard crashes from 30ft up on to asphalt without an issue other than the plastic body getting just a little off, which is easily fixed.\n\nTrue is is advertised at only 50 meter range, but the truth is more like 300 meters. I have tested it to 300 meters and still not lost signal. Many others have reported up to 450 meters right out of the box. There is also an easy to do modification that gets you over 1000 meters.\n\nOverall I see it as a top 10 drone. I see it in the top 2 for affordable drones. It's not a \"toy\" or a \"agile\" quad, but it is a perfect camera platform when on a budget. If you want a Phantom, but cannot afford it, give the Syma x8 series a try. You won't have GPS, but once you get used to controlling it manually, it can be used almost the same as the Phantom. 2 Editor's Pick Other Comments lourson 1 year ago Archived comments are found here: http://www.tomsguide.com/forum/id-2333707/drones-2014.html 2 Brendan_3 1 year ago Where can you buy a phantom 3 for 675? 1 glitchsys 1 year ago Brendan, SamsClub I think. \nI just got the U818A HD+ (under the brand name 'Holy Stone'). I wanted something a little better than the regular U818A and the Blade Nano QX seemed too much like a toy. With the 90 dollar U818A HD+ (it's more upgraded than the U818A mentioned in this article, it has a 720p camera, return to home and headless features) I hope to learn to fly a drone and see if I enjoy it. I think it borders between a toy and a real drone. If the neighbors or whomever gets upset about the drone I can say \"Relax, it's not a professional drone, it's just a cheap toy drone\" and they'll be like \"oh, ok. cool toy\" and then let me fly/learn in peace. Once I master the U818A HD+ if I really enjoy it and want something more, next stop will be the DJI Phantom 3. But I figured besides learning to fly one, I'll get a better sense of peoples reactions around my house and around the park when I fly the drone. If I encounter nothing but resistance, or I simply don'y enjoy it, then at least I didn't waste 650. 0 Brandon_31 1 year ago Just curious why there is no mention of the Syma x8c? It would be great for beginners if not for it's size and mass, but other than that it is very affordable at ($70-100), very stable, easy to fly, has a cam, headless mode, and best of all it is very tough. I have crashed mine many many times and some times very hard crashes from 30ft up on to asphalt without an issue other than the plastic body getting just a little off, which is easily fixed.\n\nTrue is is advertised at only 50 meter range, but the truth is more like 300 meters. I have tested it to 300 meters and still not lost signal. Many others have reported up to 450 meters right out of the box. There is also an easy to do modification that gets you over 1000 meters.\n\nOverall I see it as a top 10 drone. I see it in the top 2 for affordable drones. It's not a \"toy\" or a \"agile\" quad, but it is a perfect camera platform when on a budget. If you want a Phantom, but cannot afford it, give the Syma x8 series a try. You won't have GPS, but once you get used to controlling it manually, it can be used almost the same as the Phantom. 2 Editor's Pick Cory Mangine 1 year ago You really should change UDI drone the the Syma X5 because it is more maneuverable has a better battery life and is more durable. Plus the shell on the UDI is cheap plastic junk and breaks easily. So really you can get a better drone for the same price. Plus there is no way you'll be able to get a DJI Phantom 3 for under 900$ anywhere unless its black friday. 1 tennis daddy 1 year ago Seems like prices are falling fast - both Best Buy and Amazon have DJI Phantom 3 Standard for $500. That's going to be the price-point for the rest to beat. 1 Stokes344 1 year ago The Phantom 3 standard is now $499 and the advanced is $799. They had a $200 price drop starting the beginning of the year for the companies 10th anniversary. 1 realdaveking 1 year ago Thanks Brandon_31 for the tip on the syma x8. Just getting my feet wet in this hobby and that is a nice looking drone. 1 ROG2000 1 year ago IMO a better list:\n1) Hubsan X4 H107L\n2) Syma X8C\n3) Parrot Bebop 2 (I will agree with this one)\n4) Yuneec Q500 4K\n5) 3DR Solo\n6) Yuneec Typhoon H 2 akattkisson 1 year ago I can't wait to get my hands on the DJI Phantom 4.

I haven't had more fun flying and learning all the aspects the quadcopter hobby if it wasn't for the CX-20. It is priced very affordable and if you want to upgrade, it has the ability to be comparable to the top tier. Also, I would have to include the Syma X5c and X8c as the quads for learning the basics. The symas can take a beating and still continue to fly making it so a beginner does not lose interest when it is so important.... -1 akattkisson 11 months ago Will also look into the Cheerson CX-20. Drones are so exciting, in part, because the technology is evolving so quickly. 1 Jredwine 10 months ago Looking for some advice. Purchasing a drone for my daugther (16) who is very much into photography and videography (has a gopro too) but don't want to break the bank. Been reading reviews on Syma 8xg as well as Phantom 3 Standard. Clearly I like the price point of Syma but not sure if for her first drone I should be biting the bullet and buying the Phantom 3 Standard for what it offers. Any advice or other suggestions would be greatly welcomed!\n\nThanks so much! 2 akattkisson 9 months ago For a first drone, I wouldn't go all out. Buy cheap and let your daughter destroy it. It will crash, parts will break, before she gets the full handle on how to fly. Then, if she's really into it, that's when you get the fancy model. I would recommend the DJI Phantom 4 for the fancy purchase. \n\nAnonymous said: Looking for some advice.

They hope that a version of the technology could eventually supply clean drinking water in some of the driest and poorest parts of the globe.\nThe device is based on a novel material that can pull large amounts of water into its many pores. According to a study published in the journal Science on Thursday, a kilogram of the material can capture several liters of water each day in humidity levels as low as 20 percent, typical of arid regions.\nThe technology could help address a big and growing problem. A report last year in Science Advances found that four billion people, nearly half in India and China, face \u201csevere water scarcity at least one month of the year.\u201d That means water shortages affect two-thirds of the world\u2019s population. These shortages\u2014and the resulting conflicts \u2014are only expected to become more common in large parts of the world as climate change accelerates.\nA team at MIT developed the technology with Omar Yaghi\u2019s laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley. The key component is a promising class of synthetic porous materials called metal-organic frameworks, composed of organic molecules stitched together with metal atoms, which Yaghi pioneered (see \u201c A Better Way to Capture Carbon \u201d). The size and chemical character of the material\u2019s pores can be customized to capture particular types of molecules or allow them to flow through. The material also has a massive surface area, on the order of a football field per gram, enabling it to bond with a large quantity of particles.\nImages of the device\u2019s condenser over time (on the right, running from top to bottom) show a steady increase in water droplets through the day. Recommended for You The Dark Secret at the Heart of AI Edible CRISPR Could Replace Antibiotics We Need More Alternatives to Facebook Engineering the Perfect Astronaut Russian Disinformation Technology In this case, the scientists employed a previously developed version of the material that Yaghi optimized to efficiently capture water molecules. The prototype bonds with water at night or in shade. But during the day, sunlight hitting the material adds enough energy to convert the water molecules into vapor. In turn, they slip out of the material\u2019s pores and into an adjacent acrylic enclosure. A condenser at the bottom of the vessel collects the water droplets and funnels them into a chamber below, from which clean water can be collected.\nThe process is completely passive, with no need for solar panels, batteries, or additional energy. Previous water-harvesting technologies have been limited to areas with fog or other high-moisture conditions.\nThough they plan to continue refining the technology, they\u2019re \u201cnot that far away\u201d from a viable product, says Evelyn Wang, head of MIT\u2019s device research laboratory. She notes that materials of this type are already being mass-produced , at increasingly affordable prices, by the German chemical giant BASF.\nCould this technology make a real difference in some of the driest parts of the world? Tell us in the comments. Yaghi says the technology could be paired with solar panels or other equipment to boost water production for industrial or agricultural purposes. But the big hope, he says, is that these devices could become household fixtures in poorer parts of the world. That would allow families to reliably produce their own water instead of rationing whatever they can carry, or whatever is available, from community wells.\nBecome an MIT Technology Review Insider for in-depth analysis and unparalleled perspective.\nSubscribe today", "crawled": "2017-04-14T04:00:55.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "8969c7c059ea1dba8a43402f2d04b306a2017d74", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 986, "likes": 986}, "gplus": {"shares": 5}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 74}}, "country": "US", "site": "technologyreview.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "https://www.technologyreview.com/", "uuid": "8969c7c059ea1dba8a43402f2d04b306a2017d74", "section_title": "MIT Technology Review", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 9, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4nKbDUJCUNDTMkWX8nAeKS5LhguI867Do1f_w86wimeOp7WwhfDcYKDi.kJ7jl36.dR4qZN1XtlGZpiu8A1__", "domain_rank": 10416, "main_image": "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/prototype3_0.jpg?cx=0&cy=716&cw=2166&ch=1218&sw=1200", "site_full": "www.technologyreview.com", "title_full": "How to Pull Water Out of Thin Air, Even in the Driest Parts of the Globe - MIT Technology Review", "spam_score": 0.002, "title": "How to Pull Water Out of Thin Air, Even in the Driest Parts of the Globe", "published": "2017-04-13T03:00:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "china"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "india"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "yaghi"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "evelyn wang"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "omar yaghi"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "university of california, berkeley"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "quantum computers fda"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "facebook meet"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "mit"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "basf"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4nKbDUJCUNDTMkWX8nAeKS5LhguI867Do1f_w86wimeOp7WwhfDcYKDi.kJ7jl36.dR4qZN1XtlGZpiu8A1__", "author": "technologyreview.com", "external_links": ["http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja500330a", "http://www.nature.com/news/materials-science-the-hole-story-1.17274", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/figure-4-no-labels_0.jpg?sw=550&cx=216&cy=260&cw=4130&ch=2858", "http://eurekalert.us12.list-manage.com/track/click?u=394dac0d2e831bfd2ca7fc3b5&id=4a6e7a4d57&e=797f140fed", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/figure-4-no-labels_0.jpg?sw=2160&cx=216&cy=260&cw=4130&ch=2858", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/figure-4-no-labels_0.jpg?sw=1700&cx=216&cy=260&cw=4130&ch=2858", "https://ssl.drgnetwork.com/ecom/MTR/app/live/subscriptions?org=MTR&publ=TR&key_code=PRSPRIS&type=S", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/figure-4-no-labels_0.jpg?sw=1100&cx=216&cy=260&cw=4130&ch=2858", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/figure-4-no-labels_0.jpg?sw=850&cx=216&cy=260&cw=4130&ch=2858", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/figure-4-no-labels_0.jpg?sw=401&cx=216&cy=260&cw=4130&ch=2858", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/figure-4-no-labels_0.jpg?sw=1080&cx=216&cy=260&cw=4130&ch=2858", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/figure-4-no-labels_0.jpg?sw=2048&cx=216&cy=260&cw=4130&ch=2858", "http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/2/e1500323", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/figure-4-no-labels_0.jpg?sw=802&cx=216&cy=260&cw=4130&ch=2858", "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/figure-4-no-labels_0.jpg?sw=1024&cx=216&cy=260&cw=4130&ch=2858", "https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22229754.400-fog-catchers-pull-water-from-air-in-chiles-dry-fields/"], "title": "How to Pull Water Out of Thin Air, Even in the Driest Parts of the Globe", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Apple's Tree Buying Spree for Apple Park Causing Shortages   3:13 PM PDT by Juli Clover Apple is purchasing so many trees for its upcoming Apple Park campus that it's becoming challenging for other companies to source trees, according to a report from the San Francisco Chronicle . \"Buying trees is a surprisingly cutthroat business,\" reads the Chronicle in a piece about a rooftop City Park that's being built above the upcoming Transbay Transit Center in San Francisco. Adam Greenspan and Patrick Trollip, who are sourcing trees for that project, say Apple has made it hard to track down trees across California and Oregon. And it's been especially challenging to locate desirable specimens because Apple has been buying up 3,000 trees for its new Cupertino headquarters. When Greenspan and Trollip found a tree they fancied they would \"tag it\" with a locking yellow tag, so that nobody else -- like Apple -- could get it. Eventually all the tagged trees were moved to a nursery in Sunol, where the transbay project team leased 4 acres. Apple Park, Apple's second campus with the famous spaceship-shaped main building, will be completely covered in greenery. Landscaping at the site started late last year, and Apple has said it will plant more than 9,000 native and drought-resistant trees, including fruit trees. In a separate report on Apple Park, The Economist highlighted the parking situation at the campus. For the 14,000 workers that Apple plans to have on site, Apple has built nearly 11,000 parking spaces, many of them located in underground lots beneath the main building and in two garages at the south of the campus. In total, Apple has built 325,000 square meters of parking, compared to 318,000 square meters of offices and research buildings. So much space has been dedicated to parking due to Cupertino city laws, which require a certain number of parking spaces for employees. Employees will begin moving into Apple Park in April, but Apple has said it will take more than six months to transition thousands of employees to the site. Smaller building construction and landscaping has not been finished and will continue into the summer, even after the campus sees its grand opening.", "crawled": "2017-04-14T01:24:33.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-14T01:24:33.000+03:00", "uuid": "8f3aa9ad5f4a3edb3276bbbd04b5ea1c5eabe261", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 650, "likes": 650}, "gplus": {"shares": 2}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 10}}, "country": "US", "site": "macrumors.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://feeds.macrumors.com/MacRumors-All", "uuid": "8f3aa9ad5f4a3edb3276bbbd04b5ea1c5eabe261", "section_title": "MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 6, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTT_S6x0widpmkY8apq3v3WLdohCKqqpmwWC5iMX.I_5izuacSjZCsI2uPS7uduuKEhc6Buk6xSO1E_mT5VQNZb087sJmhQ4Kw-", "domain_rank": 1213, "main_image": "https://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2017/02/apple-park.jpg?retina", "site_full": "www.macrumors.com", "title_full": "Apple's Tree Buying Spree for Apple Park Causing Shortages", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Apple's Tree Buying Spree for Apple Park Causing Shortages", "published": "2017-04-14T01:24:33.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "san francisco"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "oregon"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "sunol"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cupertino"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "san francisco chronicle"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "california"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "apple park"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "ju"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "patrick trollip"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "trollip"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "adam greenspan"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "greenspan"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "apple"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "apple park causing shortages apple"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "economist"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "clover apple"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "transbay transit center"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "chronicle"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTT_S6x0widpmkY8apq3v3WLdohCKqqpmwWC5iMX.I_5izuacSjZCsI2uPS7uduuKEhc6Buk6xSO1E_mT5VQNZb087sJmhQ4Kw-", "author": "Juli Clover", "external_links": [], "title": "Apple's Tree Buying Spree for Apple Park Causing Shortages", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Galaxy S8 US Pre-Orders Come With Amplifier Speaker Dock   Dominik Bosnjak \nConsumers in the United States who pre-ordered either the Samsung Galaxy S8 or the Galaxy S8 Plus have started receiving a free Amplifier Speaker Dock, Phone Arena reports, citing one of its readers who shared some pictures of their gift that can be seen below. The box housing the gift contains a message from Samsung expressing gratitude to consumers who pre-ordered either one of the company\u2019s upcoming flagships, reminding them they should register their device when they receive it in order to gain access to some unspecified benefits and useful information. The gift itself is a cone-shaped dock designed to house the Galaxy S8 or the Galaxy S8 Plus and direct the sound from the phone\u2019s speaker, thus amplifying it. The accessory was made in a way that allows you to use it while simultaneously charging your device via a USB Type-C port. \nThe free Amplifier Speaker Dock is reportedly being sent to every individual in the country who pre-ordered either device directly through Samsung\u2019s website, meaning consumers who placed their advanced orders on the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus through retailers and wireless carriers shouldn\u2019t expect the same treatment. Regardless, many mobile service providers and retailers in the country are running their own promotions for incentivizing people to pre-order either device, while all advanced orders can also be registered on Samsung\u2019s official website which grants you significant discounts on 256GB microSD cards and AKG earphones, in addition to guaranteeing you a free Gear VR headset. \nFollowing months of rumors and anticipation, Samsung finally unveiled its latest flagship duo in late March, confirming that the Galaxy S8 features a 5.8-inch Super AMOLED display, while the Galaxy S8 Plus sports a 6.2-inch one, both of which support QHD+ (2960 x 1440) resolution. The U.S. variants of the devices are powered by the Snapdragon 835, Qualcomm\u2019s first 10nm system-on-chip (SoC), in addition to boasting 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage space. Other key features of the handsets include Bluetooth 5.0 support, IP68 certification, and a unique, almost bezel-less design. The Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus will officially be released in most markets on April 21.

RitaT \nWhy are you being so mean \u2013 over phone service comments? I feel for YOU, buddy. Life is too short. Relax. Or, does T-Mo pay you to post like this? RitaT \nThey did that to me many years ago. Big reason I\u2019ve been reluctant to go back. I hear many former customers say the same. Hopefully they are better now. mcdonsco \nIf you\u2019re in or near a big city and don\u2019t go rural very much or rarely, it\u2019s just fine. But if you\u2019re all over the state you live in it\u2019s pretty frustrating. mcdonsco \nYeah, maybe it was just how I returned the phones (in store), but three times same problem seems like more than a random glitch. |REDACTED| \nI\u2019ve had tmobile for 15 years and they have only gotten better. \nI have to One lines, unlimited for $99 a month. Eric \nBeen a Verizon customer for a while, but this may finally make me switch. Gotta get that GSM life with many more devices to choose from \ud83d\ude0d \nGSM life is the realness. mcdonsco \nDo yourself a favor and go AT&T or even Cricket to go GSM. See my post below\u2026T-Mobile has a competence problem in addition to noticeably less coverage than Verizon or AT&T. nathan carter \nI\u2019ve had T-Mobile for over 2 years. T- mobile is a great choice and has the best pricing. Tyler Durden \n$50 for unlimited everything and when I travel. It\u2019s great. mcdonsco \nT-Mobile? Grandfathered on their original unlimited plan? aergern \nI\u2019ve had TMO for the last 5 years .. no competence issues. Are you thinking back to the 20th century? \ud83d\ude09 And the point of this article is spectrum for coverage. They said last year they were converting all 2G towers to LTE and this is how they\u2019ll do it. AT&T has this greed issue where as when you travel outside of the U.S. you get beat in the face with charges while TMO has really good LTE roaming. MicroNix \nI\u2019ve also known people on TMO in the last 5 years that switched off of it because they couldn\u2019t hold a call. And to put it bluntly, I\u2019ve never known *anyone* who travels for a living that has TMO for their carrier. \nTMO seems to be a very location specific experience. If you live where there\u2019s coverage its great. If you live in a less populous area, it can be disastrous. While better than only just a few years ago, it seems many dead spots remain. Hiran Andy Merskin \nThere\u2019s been a few times where I\u2019ve been in the mountains or other remote locations and had perfect T-Mobile service, while my Verizon friend had none, or maaaaybe 1 bar if they were lucky. \nBut this is anecdotal. Can\u2019t speak for all areas. This was in Colorado while hiking a fair distance from Denver. Steve Taylor \nWell I know a lot of airline employees that have and love T-Mobile and guess what they travel for a living. You can always find that one spot/area that any particular carrier struggles with service which can be due to spectrum availability, terrain in relation to their tower or even just their ability to put a tower up. I know one area here in GA in particular that the other 3 carriers have a tower but the city/county won\u2019t let TMO have one because the feel 3 is enough and don\u2019t want another one. \nRegardless from someone in the airline business, having unlimited, free international roaming, free gogo and I rarely ever have call issues I can\u2019t imagine having anyone else as a carrier. twiz0r \nSeriously? ATT blows. wtf are you talking about mcdonsco \nWorked fine for me with no noticeable difference in coverage from Verizon for a few years (on Cricket to boot!). Only problem I had was unreliable MMS which ultimately I chalked up to a Cricket issue. MicroNix \nI have to agree with you on this one. I\u2019ve seen zero difference in coverage between Cricket (AT&T) and Verizon even on cross-country trips. And having a large selection of GSM unlocked phones AND a cheaper plan keeps me happy! mcdonsco \nYup. Everyone always mentions the 8mb cap on Cricket but it never effected/bothered me. But, I also don\u2019t play games nor download massive files on my phone, though I do use hotspot a lot :-/ (nevermind the fact that the higher speeds aren\u2019t common on the other carriers unless you\u2019re usually in a strong signal area; pings are a lot better though, so for gaming its probably noticeable). \nI only went back to Verizon because my additional line on a family plan costs me less than what I paid on Cricket and I know the coverage is #1 and that my MMS problems would cease (which, they have). \nAs for phone selection, I need to be limited, went a little crazy with my mobile tech addiction the last few years being GSM; my bank account is much happier now. illregal \nAs a company, I\u2019d tend to agree with you. But as a mobile provider, they\u2019re pretty good. They also bought up almost all of the 5g spectrum. So soon enough they\u2019ll be leavin everyone in the dust. dan428 \nEvery carrier has issues but the T-Mobile Tuesdays pay for my plan in value alone 4g63mark \nAgreed. I traveled from California to Tennessee recently on the I-40 and rarely had service. We had to keep using my dads Verizon phone to stay in touch\u2026\u2026. I had service in big cities, but that\u2019s it. \nThe whole point of this is now T-Mobile is going to be able to compete on many more levels. Baseer \nhhmm\u2026according to DSLReports.com \u201cThe spectrum itself won\u2019t be immediately usable. The FCC says the agency is now beginning a 39-month transition period to move broadcast stations to new channel assignments before that spectrum is put to use \u2014 most notably on expanding the range of existing networks thanks to the 600 MHz band capability of penetrating through walls (aka: indoors).\u201d \nso I\u2019m not sure what TMo is talking about \nhttps://www.dslreports.com/shownews/Dish-ATT-Comcast-TMobile-Big-Winners-in-Spectrum-Auction-139371 Wes Harris \nThis is correct. It will take that long to re-pack all the TV stations that currently are in the 600Mhz bandwidth. It will be 2020 before the full spectrum can be used. Clifton K. Morris \nNot only that, I wonder if there\u2019s enough fiber to carry all that traffic. \nA 10Mhz LTE channel can carry 150MB-200Mb of data. Next, at 600Mhz, that 10Mhz channel could cover as much as 1200 square miles. \nAdding to these complications, and in many areas, TMO won 40-50MHz. If fully used and deployed, across 40-50,000 towers that\u2019s a lot of data. \nPoint is, It\u2019d require a great amount of engineering work; and TMO\u2019s network is congested as it is\u2026! A recent report in my area showed TMO having a 4.5% dropped call rate; nearly 4x the amount of VZ and double the amount of AT&T. Scott Wilson \nYeah it\u2019s like they didn\u2019t even do anything good at all. Hell, we should be picking on them loudly for this rather than celebrating their good fortune. Hell, we should act like people that have stock in some other company while we are at it. Baseer \nunlimited data is back because of TMO, 2 year contracts are over with (even though ppl sign up for device payments) bc of TMO, price wars are bc of TMO. I LOVE what TMO is doing, but I\u2019m not okay with marketing lies and misleading the general non-techie/informed populace. toptekjon \nRight, cause Clifton K. Morris surely knows more than the thousands of engineers working at Tmobile. I use tmobile, and their network is not at all congested in any area I have visited. By far, the fastest mobile data speeds \u2013 in my personal use. This includes all over upstate NY, New York City, Chicago, LA, etc\u2026Tmobiles network is phenomenal. I regulary get speeds of 30-70mbps down and 15-40 mpbps up. \nTmobile is the only large network (wireless or landline) around that knows how to treat their customers as well. I\u2019m a huge fan of what Tmobile has and continues to do. Jeandring \nI\u2019ve made $84,000 so far this year working online and I\u2019m a full time student.

The Doctor \nThis won\u2019t be fully operational for a few years. It\u2019s not like it\u2019s going to be ready tomorrow. Eric \nI know and I never said I was going to make the switch immediately. I was just welcoming the new development. Steve Taylor \nIn John Legere\u2019s statement they say they have plans to have some areas up on 600 by the end of the year. It notes that their tower radios by Ericsson and Nokia already support 600. \nIt\u2019s going to be limited at first to very rural areas, as all the urban and those in 50-100 miles of urban areas will have to wait until TV broadcasters move. The Doctor \nCool story. DC_Guy \nI just made the big switch from Verizon to T-Mo in March. I NEVER thought I\u2019d give up my beloved Verizon unlimited data plan but then I had the need for a second line. I was paying $96 a month including taxes and fees and after corporate discount for my ONE Verizon line. My TWO T-Mo lines are $100 total, taxes and fees baked in. I live in DC so coverage is not a problem plus now I get to use this sweet Axon 7. Really enjoying the GSM life so far. Nostradamus \nGSM, sounds like some one stil living inside of a cave. LTE is the future LOL and with Verizon we already had LTE, then LTE Advanced, and now working to get 5G, meanwhile you still want to get GSM LOL !!! seventy4burban \nLTE is a GSM technology\u2026\u2026 Nick L. \nT-Mo is probably closer to 5G than any other carrier right now\u2026 Not to mention that LTE is GSM technology \nLTE is a form of GSM\u2026 Brian Cruz \nPerfectly said. I\u2019m in the same boat. I\u2019m ready!! So stoked for all the unlocked goodness Raj Bhatt \nT-Mobile was awesome for me as long as I stuck to freeways and cities, but I had to switch to VZW for coverage in rural areas. Has T-Mo built more towers or is this just adding spectrum to existing towers? If it is the same towers, then I fear that their coverage problem isn\u2019t solved by this. \nHonestly, I\u2019d be happy to switch back to T-Mo if I can get LTE coverage everywhere. Suicide_Note \nThis spectrum reaches further, so they may be able to avoid building more towers. Or, if more towers are deemed necessary, they may not need to build quite so many. Flying_Timbus \nI wonder if Project Fi will be able to take advantage of that as well. If so, this will be huge for me \ud83d\ude42 Suicide_Note \nOnce the phones with the proper modems in them are available, i see no reason why they shouldn\u2019t be able to take advantage of this. Jeff \nOnly if your phone can connect to the 600 MHz bands\u2026 Murphy\u2019s Magnet \nThat sound you hear is Verizon fanboys crying. brian. \nUgh. I sure hope people like that don\u2019t exist\u2026 Murphy\u2019s Magnet \nEvery carrier and OEM has their fanboys. They will argue that their carrier of choice and phone of choice are the best and nothing will change their mind. You\u2019ll see plenty of them here on this thread talking about how T-Mobile sucks and \u201cinsert carrier name\u201d is better because \u201creason x,y or z\u201d. Chris Hannan \nExcept Sprint. I\u2019ve seen a few people say Sprint works for them, but I\u2019ve *never* seen someone argue that Sprint is the best. Murphy\u2019s Magnet \nFair point. sinfoman \nGiven what you pay and what you\u2019 get with Sprint, I\u2019d say it\u2019s the best, BUT the big caveat there is you can\u2019t be out in the sticks. Then no bueno. 90% of customers, though? Winning. Chris Hannan \nThe only thing Sprint wins at is price. They\u2019re the slowest, they have the worst coverage overall, and they\u2019re still using CDMA for voice, so there\u2019s no VoLTE or unlocked phone compatibility (minus a few exceptions). \nThey\u2019re the only major carrier that still can\u2019t do simultaneous voice and data without two active radios in the phone, which most new phones don\u2019t have. \nSo even those who have Sprint and it works fine for them, they still don\u2019t argue that it\u2019s the best because many of them know it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just cheaper and it works. Lee \nI mean I\u2019ve had Sprint for 5 years now and in the last month they have significantly increased speeds. I regularly hit 60 Mbps no matter what time of the day. Last night was the highest I\u2019ve ever seen with 130Mbps. I will agree that coverage lacks but thats the only downfall I\u2019ve ever ran into with Sprint. Sprints launching Gigabit wireless tested in Louisiana at a stadium. We have to give Sprint props from where they used to be. They have improved a lot in the last few years. \nNot a fanboy for Sprint. Looked into T-Mobile (lacks coverage in my area) and Verizon Unlimited ( Would jack my phone bill 3x the amount I pay with Sprint with everything the same) They say that its 180 for four lines which isnt true once you add the I think 20 dollar access fee per line. Thats another 80 on top the 180 plus phone costs. Sprint is my carrier of choice have never had an issue. Actially have gotten coverage full LTE where Verizon people are sitting on 1x. Although that isnt common just thought it was funny. Hopefully Tmobile will bring coverage to my area. Chris Hannan \nI live in southeastern Louisiana and, while I never had a speed test on RingPlus (former Sprint MVNO) reach over 20Mbps, I will say Sprint was pretty good overall. There was one (fairly busy) spot in town where service was utter garbage, but it worked fine almost everywhere else. In fact, I seem to travel to more areas with bad service on AT&T now than I did with RingPlus. \nVerizon, on the other hand, has been phenomenal since I switched to them for my main line six years ago. It\u2019s so very rare I\u2019ll have bad coverage somewhere and someone on another carrier has better service than me, but the other way around is not uncommon at all. Lee \nYeah, central Illinois is a strong Sprint Market. Seems to get the latest upgrades first. Only nice thing about illinois. Lol MicroNix \nYeah, Verizon and all of its little charges is absolutely unbelievable. Four lines with this amount of data for this price, plus device access fee, plus this tax, plus that tax\u2026.before you know it, your bill is nowhere even close to what the original promo was pushing. Bunch of misleading bulls***! So nice to be on Cricket where my bill is exactly what they advertise. Not a penny more. No taxes, no fees, no device access charges. sinfoman \nThe voice/data thing is STUPID. But I can assure you, this is a Sprint congestion decision and NOT because they don\u2019t have the capability. Why? Because my S3 on Jellybean could do it. The upgrade to KK and higher has seen Sprint lock this feature down. Now that IS STUPID, but from their perspective allows their speeds to compete. And yes, they do compete. http://rootmetrics.com/en-US/rootscore/map/metro/louisville-ky/2017/1H \u2013 2 percentage points behind where I live. Ottumwa< IA maybe not so much, but\u2026 I pay (AFTER taxes/fees, which is important) 140 for two lines of unlimited everything. And frankly, I pay too much, but my wife wants unlimited (even though we RARELY even use 8 GB per month of data, which would save us some bank. But considering the price I pay, and the minimumj hit I take in service, I would argue it's the best. Not the fastest, but the best, if that distinction makes sense. Chris Hannan \nThe reason Sprint doesn\u2019t have VoLTE is because calls drop when you lose LTE, unlike on AT&T and T-Mobile. Verizon allows it anyway because they have so much LTE, but Sprint still has too many 3G-only spots. \nOld phones could do voice and data because they\u2019d use 3G for voice and LTE for data, but that uses significantly more data powering two radios. Apple never built this into the iPhone, so only select Android phones ever took advantage of this. cromo8 \nHappens every time hence my comment here. brian. \nThe humanity! Bigbudd45 \nSo Ill argue that Verizon has the best network in my area\u2026.but do people really argue its someone inately better and always will be? If someone has a network that is as good with unlimited data for less money ill switch. I have a grandfathered Unlimited plan, so for now, no one else can offer me a better plan. mcdonsco", "crawled": "2017-04-13T23:10:13.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-13T23:10:13.000+03:00", "uuid": "bca1ea70c7ec6dbc0293e68fb7af9c4853e483a7", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 830, "likes": 830}, "gplus": {"shares": 73}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 64}}, "country": "US", "site": "droid-life.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.droid-life.com/rss", "uuid": "bca1ea70c7ec6dbc0293e68fb7af9c4853e483a7", "section_title": "Droid Life", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 8, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.dVl4quv6k4HuQsJyCZPJIDKwY8L_Carnuj6H7g32UV5ygVDx2TCvN3McIZrN1ihvlQNNX4qCDEZi0WNk74789sxsbzyu00CuqK0NYTz3T8aGprZVCD_X7", "domain_rank": 8301, "main_image": "http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/tmobile-coverage-map.jpg", "site_full": "www.droid-life.com", "title_full": "T-Mobile Just Picked Up the 600MHz \u201cSpectrum Motherload\u201d to Bring Their Network Everywhere", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "T-Mobile Just Picked Up the 600MHz \u201cSpectrum Motherload\u201d to Bring Their Network Everywhere", "published": "2017-04-13T23:10:13.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "t-mobile"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "qualcomm"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "fcc"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "verizon"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "at&t"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.dVl4quv6k4HuQsJyCZPJIDKwY8L_Carnuj6H7g32UV5ygVDx2TCvN3McIZrN1ihvlQNNX4qCDEZi0WNk74789sxsbzyu00CuqK0NYTz3T8aGprZVCD_X7", "author": "Kellex", "external_links": [], "title": "T-Mobile Just Picked Up the 600MHz \u201cSpectrum Motherload\u201d to Bring Their Network Everywhere", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Thursday, April 13, 2017 Wang Wei Do you like watching funny videos online? I am not kind of a funny person, but I love watching funny videos clips online, and this is one of the best things that people can do in their spare time. But, beware if you have installed a funny video app from Google Play Store. A security researcher has discovered a new variant of the infamous Android banking Trojan hiding in apps under different names, such as Funny Videos 2017 , on Google Play Store. Niels Croese, the security researcher at Securify B.V firm, analyzed the Funny Videos app that has 1,000 to 5,000 installs and found that the app acts like any of the regular video applications on Play Store, but in the background, it targets victims from banks around the world. This newly discovered banking Trojan works like any other banking malware, but two things that makes it different from others are \u2014 its capability to target victims and use of DexProtector tool to obfuscate the app's code. Dubbed BankBot , the banking trojan targets customers of more than 420 banks around the world, including Citibank, ING, and some new Dutch banks, like ABN, Rabobank, ASN, Regiobank, and Binck, among many others. How Android Banking Trojan Works In a nutshell, BankBot is mobile banking malware that looks like a simple app and once installed, allows users to watch funny videos, but in the background, the app can intercept SMS and display overlays to steal banking information. Mobile banking trojan often disguises itself as a plugin app, like Flash, or an adult content app, but this app made its way to Google Play Store by disguising itself as any other regular Android app. Google has removed this malicious app from its Play Store after receiving the report from the researcher, but this does not mean that more such apps do not exist there with different names. \"Another problem is that Google [Play Store] mainly relies on automated scanning without a full understanding of the current obfuscation vectors resulting in banking malware on the Google Play Store.\" researcher told The Hacker News. Once downloaded, the app persistently requests administrative rights, and if granted, the banking malware can control everything that's happening on an infected smartphone. The BankBot springs into action when the victim opens any of the mobile apps from a pre-configured list of 425 banking apps. A complete list of banks a BankBot variant is currently imitating can be found on the blog post published by the researcher. Once one of the listed apps is opened, BankBot immediately displays an overlay, which is a page on the top of legitimate mobile banking app and tricks Android users entering their banking credentials into the overlay, just like a phishing attack. This will not only sends your banking credentials to your bank\u2019s servers but also sends your financial credentials to the server controlled by fraudsters. This social engineering technique is often used by financially motivated criminals to deceive users into giving up their personal details and sensitive banking information to fraudsters. How to protect yourself? There are standard protection measures you need to follow to remain unaffected: Install a good antivirus app that can detect and block such malware before it can infect your device. Always keep the app up-to-date. Always stick to trusted sources, like Google play Store and the Apple App Store, and verify app permissions before installing apps. If any app is asking more than what it is meant for, just do not install it. Do not download apps from third party source. Although in this case, the app is being distributed through the official Play Store, most often such malware are distributed via untrusted third-party app stores. Avoid unknown and unsecured Wi-Fi hotspots and Keep your Wi-Fi turned OFF when not in use. Be careful which apps you give administrative rights to. Admin rights are powerful and can give an app full control of your device. Never click on links in SMS or MMS sent to your mobile phone. Even if the email looks legit, go directly to the website of origin and verify any possible updates.

Niels Croese,   at Securify B.V firm, analyzed the Funny Videos app that has 1,000 to 5,000 installs and found that the app acts like any of the regular video applications on Play Store, but in the background, it targets victims from   This newly discovered banking Trojan works like any other banking malware, but two things that makes it different from others are \u2014 its capability to target victims and use of DexProtector tool to obfuscate the app's code. Dubbed BankBot , the banking trojan targets customers of more than 420   including Citibank, ING, and some new Dutch banks, like ABN, Rabobank, ASN, Regiobank, and Binck, among many others. How Android Banking Trojan Works In a nutshell, BankBot is mobile banking malware that looks like a simple app and once installed, allows users to watch funny videos, but in the background, the app can intercept SMS and display overlays to steal banking information. Mobile banking trojan often disguises itself as a plugin app, like Flash, or an adult content app, but this app made its way to Google Play Store by disguising itself as any other regular Android app. Google has removed this malicious app from its Play Store after receiving the report from the researcher, but this does not mean that more such apps do not exist there with different names. \"Another problem is that Google [Play Store] mainly relies on automated scanning without a full understanding of the current obfuscation vectors resulting in banking malware on the Google Play Store.\" researcher told The Hacker News. Once downloaded, the app persistently requests administrative rights, and if granted, the banking malware can control everything that's happening on an infected smartphone. The BankBot springs into action when the victim opens any of the mobile apps from a pre-configured list of 425 banking apps. A complete list of banks a BankBot variant is currently imitating can be found on the blog post published by the researcher. Once one of the listed apps is opened, BankBot immediately displays an overlay, which is a page on the top of legitimate mobile banking app and tricks Android users entering their banking credentials into the overlay, just like a phishing attack. This will not only sends your banking credentials to your bank\u2019s servers but also sends your financial credentials to the server controlled by fraudsters. This social engineering technique is often used by financially motivated criminals to deceive users into giving up their personal details and sensitive banking information to fraudsters. How to protect yourself? There are standard protection measures you need to follow to remain unaffected: Install a good antivirus app that can detect and block such malware before it can infect your device. Always keep the app up-to-date. Always stick to trusted sources, like Google play Store and the Apple App Store, and verify app permissions before installing apps. If any app is asking more than what it is meant for, just do not install it. Do not download apps from third party source. Although in this case, the app is being distributed through the official Play Store, most often such malware are distributed via untrusted third-party app stores. Avoid unknown and unsecured Wi-Fi hotspots and Keep your Wi-Fi turned OFF when not in use. Be careful which apps you give administrative rights to. Admin rights are powerful and can give an app full control of your device. Never click on links in SMS or MMS sent to your mobile phone. Even if the email looks legit, go directly to the website of origin and verify any possible updates.

The Xperia XA1 is the most affordable Xperia-branded smartphone that arrived during MWC 2017, and the phone is priced at Rs. 20,990 ($326) in India, for those of you who are interested. \nThe Sony Xperia XA1 will be available at all Sony centers and major electronic stores in the country, and it comes in Black, White and Pink variants to the Indian smartphone market. Now, in addition to that, it\u2019s also worth mentioning that the company is offering a three-month subscription of SonyLIV for free with the Xperia XA1 purchase. The Sony Xperia XA1 has really thin side bezels, but its bezels above and below the display are quite thick, unfortunately, though that might not bother some of you, especially considering this phone is quite compact due to its display size. The Sony Xperia XA1 sports a 5-inch 720p (1280 x 720) IPS LCD display, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of expandable internal storage. The phone is fueled by the Helio P20 64-bit octa-core processor, along with the Mali-T880MP2 GPU for graphics. \nA 23-megapixel snapper is placed on the back of this smartphone, and an 8-megapixel shooter can be found on its front side. A 2,300mAh battery is also included in this package, and Android 7.0 Nougat comes pre-installed on the Xperia XA1, while Sony\u2019s custom UI is placed on top of it. Pump Express+ 2.0 fast charging is also included here, and so is 4G LTE connectivity, of course. The Sony Xperia XA1 measures 145 x 67 x 8mm, while it weighs 143 grams, in case you were wondering. The Sony Xperia XA1 can not measure up to the sheer power of the Xperia XZs or the Xperia XZ Premium, but it sure is a compelling smartphone for the said price, as it has a really compelling SoC on the inside, plenty of RAM, and is quite compact, if that\u2019s something that you\u2019re looking for. We still do not know when exactly will the Xperia XA1 go on sale in India, but that will happen really soon, so stay tuned.

Then there are those who like to tread paths unknown. The man behind the YouTube channel Strange Parts, a programmer and self-professed geek, appears to be one such person, as he tasked himself with creating an iPhone 6s on his own \u2013 using parts purchased from China\u2019s famed Shenzhen markets. \nHe recorded his journey in achieving this feat and uploaded the video on YouTube. The only video on the Strange Parts channel , his journey has garnered close to a million views, 2,500 comments, and 25,000 likes on YouTube. Despite having just a single video, the channel has over 20,000 subscribers now \u2013 all within 22 hours of uploading the video on the video sharing platform. \n\nThe project started with search for a metal back case, which was rather easy to get. This was followed by search for someone who could engrave the laser markings to align cables and the patch where the antenna is housed \u2013 which eventually took him to a small shop in the market that got the job done. \nHe also took the help of a Chinese man named Frank to buy other parts need to make his own iPhone 6s. The duo went looking for shops to buy the glass panel, digitiser, LCD panel, and backlight. Another shop filled with electronics components is where the first major milestone was achieved \u2013 the iPhone screen was assembled successfully. \nWith the back panel and screen in his possession, and next up was the logic board \u2013 the heart of the smartphone. Though he tried to get the logic board up and running by himself, he met his first major failure, after which he enrolled in an institute that taught how to repair smartphones. With a new logic board and battery in place, he was able to get the phone working. However, the obstacle was that the compass on the home-made iPhone 6s did not work, meaning another trip to the market. Another morning was spent on buying parts such as camera modules, Home button, screws, etc. \nDespite his training at the smartphone repair institute, he missed out on a few tricks in assembling his iPhone 6s, which meant another trip to the market to find out where he went wrong. With that sorted, the video shows that assembling the iPhone 6s was a smooth process \u2013 and voila, the home-made unit worked like a charm. \nThe project took \u201ca couple of months,\u201d he says, adding that it is easy for even newbies to assemble an iPhone, and that it is no different from assembling your own desktop PC - though we'd beg to differ. For one, it involves way too much effort, and, the resultant product could very well blow up in your face (literally) without the numerous safety checks of a full-fledged, quality-tested production line. \nThere you have it, an instructional video on how to build your own iPhone 6s. Of course, you'll need access to the limitless spare parts available in China's Shenzhen markets, more than a little experience with assembling miniaturised components, a decent amount of cash (though the video doesn't describe the cost of the parts or the courses), and even a pleasing manner to convince busy shopkeepers to help out. If you feel the effort is worth the pleasure of owning a DIY iPhone, here's your chance.

The drawings depict an iPhone 8 front and back with minimal bezels on the left and right sides of the screen. Compared to an iPhone 7 , the top and bottom bezels are also significantly smaller. \nOn the back, the dual camera system and rear flash is stacked vertically in the top-left corner, with a gap for a Touch ID fingerprint sensor below the Apple logo. The image is labelled with dimensions for the chassis, which are comparable to the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 \u2014 despite the significantly larger screen \u2026 The best, strongest, Lightning cables ... buy braided cables here \nAs shown in the table, this is supposedly an image of design drawings for the iPhone 8\u2019s Engineering Validation Test third revision. EVT is an early stage in the Apple product development cycle, the device must still pass through Design Validation Test and Production Validation Test stages before it is finalized. \nThis is to say that all the design choices in the schematics shown here are not necessarily locked down. We\u2019ve been hearing a lot about the Touch ID home button, Apple is apparently juggling different designs with the aim to have the fingerprint sensor integrated into the display, under the glass. \nIf this is the case, EVT03 is likely a fallback design, ready in reserve, which simply puts that sensor on the back. \nThe iPhone 8 drawings are annotated with dimensions which back up claims from KGI that the device would be about the same physical size as the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 , featuring a much larger 5.8 inch OLED screen by shrinking the bezels. \nFrom this drawing, the iPhone 8 device is measured at 149 mm tall, 72.5 mm wide and 7.1 mm thin (excluding the dual camera thickness, which still protrudes). To compare, the iPhone 7 is 138 mm tall, 67.1 mm wide and 7.1 mm. If this leak is to be believed, the device will be the same thinness as the current phone and about one centimetre taller. \n( Update : Ryan Jones points out that the table in the left is likely the specs for the iPhone 7S Plus, and that all the numbers in the right column are for the iPhone 8. This would suggest the iPhone 8 is 8.6 mm thick, including the camera bump. This would mean it is almost the same as the iPhone 7 Plus in thickness.) \nIt\u2019s worth noting that the general design here mirrors a sketchily sourced mockup we saw a couple of weeks ago, that also placed the Touch ID ring on the rear side and had similar screen bezel proportions. As with all Weibo leaks, we have to take care in believing anything at face value. \nThat\u2019s not to say Weibo hasn\u2019t turned up the goods in previous years; schematics of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 7 all leaked by mid March in their respective years. \nApple is widely rumoured to be introducing three new iPhones this year, two iterative updates with the same chassis as the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus , and one major revamp. This latter device is what is pictured above, the \u2018iPhone 8\u2019 or \u2018iPhone Edition\u2019 or \u2018iPhone Pro\u2019 or whatever, and will apparently feature a 3D sensing front camera, wireless charging , 3 GB RAM , 521 PPI display and more in addition to the new external design.

The South Korean consumer electronics manufacturer made some radical design changes compared to its 2016 flagship models as the company opted to remove the physical Home button from its latest devices and move their fingerprint scanners to the back, in addition to offering more screen real estate in a similarly sized package. The Galaxy S8 sports a 5.8-inch Super AMOLED display panel while the Galaxy S8 Plus boasts a 6.2-inch one, both of which support QHD+ resolution of 2960 by 1440 pixels. The U.S. variants of the handsets are powered by Qualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon 835 system-on-chip while most other markets will receive models equipped with Samsung\u2019s own Exynos 8895 SoC.

Base models start at 64GB of storage space and otherwise don\u2019t differ from their counterparts as all members of the Galaxy S8 lineup boast IP68 certification, Bluetooth 5.0 support, and Bixby, Samsung\u2019s new artificial intelligence (AI) assistant that\u2019s meant to serve as an alternative to the Google Assistant, Alexa, Siri, and Cortana. \nBoth Samsung and industry analysts expect the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8 Plus to be massive commercial hits that will even outsell the widely popular Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge. First details on their commercial performance should follow this spring as the devices are scheduled to hit the market on April 21.

The Swift University based in Reggio Emilia claims to be the first, globally, to offer the course for Android, and aims to show students how to use the programming language across both platforms while avoiding the limitations associated with cross-platform middleware such as Xamarin . At the heart of the course is the use of a bespoke integrated development environment (IDE), rather than a converter, that allows coders to program in Swift instead of Java while using the normal classes of the Android SDK. The course summary, through Google Translate, is as follows: By attending this course you will learn how to program apps for Android devices via the Android SDK but written in the Swift language. Thanks to this innovative course, students can easily port iOS projects to Android and/or develop a multi-platform app without using a middleware. This course is suitable for those who are already programmers in Swift, Java, C #, Objective-C and other programming languages. Topics are updated to the latest version of Android SDK. Swift was introduced by Apple in 2014, with the aim of replacing Objective-C as an easier-to-learn language, and garnered major support from IBM and a variety of apps like Lyft, Pixelmator, and Vimeo. Since then it has steadily risen to prominence among both emerging and established developers, and last month broke into the top 10 in the TIOBE Index , which ranks programming languages by popularity. Apple has actively promoted Swift as ideal for children who are keen to code, demonstrating its gentle learning curve in Swift Playgrounds , an app that teaches children how to use the language. Apple has been updating and refining Swift since its debut, and unveiled Swift 3.1 on March 27 .

While this is a new feature, it is technically an extension of the company\u2019s already available FreeTime platform . FreeTime is designed to offer a more child-friendly environment when it comes to the types of apps, books, and games, that a child can encounter when using one of Amazon\u2019s Fire-branded devices . Discussion cards on the other hand, are designed for adults and in particular, the parents of children who use FreeTime. \nIn the simplest of terms, Discussion cards act as a means to offer parents a greater insight into the type of content that their children are engaging with through FreeTime. The name, Discussion Cards, draws on the fact that in receipt of that greater insight, parents will then be able to discuss and engage with their children on the content they are interested in. To coincide with the launch of Discussion Cards, Amazon has also confirmed the launch of a new \u2018Parent Dashboard.\u2019 This is a mobile optimized website where parents will be able to check Discussion Cards, as well as glean an overall idea of what their children are using their tablets for, including a more detailed breakdown of how time with the FreeTime-enabled device is being spent. The new Parent Dashboard is now available and can be found at http://parents.amazon.com. \nBack to the Discussion Cards and through these cards parents will effectively be able to take a sneak peak at content available to their children, by way of a brief summary of the app/book/game, as well as some questions that the parent can in turn use as a talking point when further discussing the app/book/game with their children. From the examples provided by Amazon, some of the questions are specifically designed with a learning aspect in mind. So as well as generally igniting conversation, the questions will also provide insight into what the child has learned and can even, act as an additional prompt for further learning or activities based around the content of the app/book/game. At present, Amazon notes that \u201cthousands\u201d of Discussion Cards are already available for the company\u2019s most popular titles, and more will be added on a daily basis.

HTC introduced us to the HTC U Ultra in between CES 2017 and MWC 2017 with little fanfare and advertising. The complete opposite is true for the Samsung Galaxy S8, but then Samsung has the money to promote its new flagships and it shows. Both devices use a glass front and back with a metal frame, but then they part company and go in different design directions. The HTC U Ultra looks like a traditional symmetrical smartphone whereas the Galaxy S8 looks more futuristic. The HTC U Ultra will only work on AT&T and T-Mobile in the US and the Galaxy S8 will work on all major carriers. Let\u2019s see just what these two smartphones have in common and just how much they differ. \nThe HTC U Ultra and the Samsung Galaxy S8 do have a few things in common. For starters, they both use the same style construction of glass on the front and the back with a metal frame that holds everything together. Their displays are very close in size with the U Ultra using a 5.7-inch display and the Galaxy S8 using a 5.8-inch display. However, the U Ultra is physically much larger and 15 grams heavier. Both displays use the QHD resolution (QHD+ on the S8), but different technologies and they both have an \u2018always-on\u2019 feature. They both use a Snapdragon processor; although the U Ultra is using the older SD821 model and the Galaxy S8 uses the newest SD835. Both use an Adreno GPU for graphics, but again different models. They both are packing 4GB of DDR4 RAM and 64GB of base internal memory and both are expandable via a microSD card. Both devices offer an excellent camera area with 12MP main cameras \u2013 HTC uses UltraPixel 2, while Samsung uses Dual Pixels. They each have Hi-Res audio and a fingerprint sensor to unlock the device as well as to authorize mobile payments, including Android Pay. Both devices have a 3000mAh non-removable battery that includes rapid charge. They both have the usual suspects \u2013 WiFi, Bluetooth (v4.2 in the U Ultra and v5.0 in the S8), GPS, NFC, and a reversible Type-C port for charging and data transfer. They also are both running Android Nougat out-of-the-box. \nPlease take a thoughtful look at the detailed Specifications Comparison chart below, and here you will see just how these two great devices stack up against one another \u2013 click on the \u201cView Full Comparison\u201d link at the end of the chart to expand the details. After that, we will look at each device in greater depth and point out some of its pros and cons. From all of this information, we will try to determine the winner based on specs and execution of design and functions. \nSpecifications \nHTC U Ultra \nHTC, which has had many rough spots over the years, may have created another \u2018pothole\u2019 with their newest HTC U Ultra smartphone. They completely abandoned their signature all-metal housing and jumped into an all-glass design that is so shiny on the back, you may need a case just to ward off the fingerprints and to add some grip to the device. HTC, always in a hurry to release their device before LG and Samsung, made their announcement between the big electronic shows when nobody was listening and then took their good old time to physically release the device. It is using last year\u2019s Snapdragon 821 and AT&T and T-Mobile are the only carriers it works on in the US \u2013 once again losing half a country of potential users. Make no mistake, the HTC U Ultra is a beautiful looking smartphone, but in an age where bezels are disappearing, we wonder just how well it will sell. \nThe HTC U Ultra sports a primary display of 5.7-inch Super LCD5 display with a Quad HD resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels and 513 pixels-per-inch (PPI.) The secondary display is 1040 x 160 pixels (2.05-inches) and is used as a notification display \u2013 it acts like the dual display on the LG V20 or the \u2018always-on\u2019 display on the Samsung Galaxy S8. It is using the Qualcomm 821 quad-core processor with a dual-core clocked at 1.6GHZ and a dual-core clocked at 2.15GHz. This is really the SD820 on \u2018steroids\u2019 and packs 10-percent better performance according to Qualcomm. For graphics, it uses the very capable Adreno 530 GPU. It packs 4GB of DDR4 RAM and 64GB of base internal memory \u2013 a 128GB version is coming \u2013 and both will allow expansion of the memory via a microSD card. \nHTC had always had problems with its camera area until last year when they put together the right parts and pieces to produce great photos. Not much has changed in the new HTC U Ultra that still uses the 12MP UltraPixel 2 sensor for their main camera along with an aperture of f/1.8, phase detection autofocus (PDAF) and Laser focus, a dual-tone LED flash, and OIS. They included a huge 16MP front-facing camera (FFC) that comes with an f/2.0 aperture, UltraPixel mode, Full HD 1080p, and offers excellent selfies and video chatting. It uses a large 3000mAh non-removable battery for power and has Quick Charge 3.0 capabilities. \nA front-mounted fingerprint sensor will allow you to unlock your device or authorize mobile payments, including Android Pay. HTC will have its own version of Google Assistant, HTC Sense Companion, built into the device. HTC BoomSound Hi-Fi is also part of the HTC package. HTC also offers a complimentary UH OH Warranty for a 30-day no questions asked return and a one-year, one-time replacement for broken screens or water damage. The HTC U Ultra measures in at 162.41 x 79.79 x 3.6 \u2013 7.99mm, and weighs in at 170 grams. In the box, you will receive a pair of HTC USonic Adaptive Earphones. HTC Connect is included for connection to items that use Chromecast, DLNA, Airplay, and Miracast Devices. It comes in Brilliant Black, Ice White, and Sapphire Blue. It will be running Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box and the 64GB will cost you about $749. \nSamsung Galaxy S8 \nThe difference between the looks of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and its predecessor is astounding \u2013 gone is the flat display and in comes their new Infinity Display that has no left or right bezels and allows Samsung to squeeze much more display into a smaller area. One of Samsung\u2019s most talked about staples, the physical \u2018Home\u2019 button, is gone and along with the \u2018Back\u2019 and \u2018App\u2019 keys are now part of the lower part of the display that has 3D Touch capabilities. Although the fingerprint sensor is now on the back and located near the camera lens, Samsung gives us easier ways to unlock the device by way of facial recognition and an iris scanner. Just in the appearance alone, the Galaxy S8 is one sexy looking device, but what kind of specs does it supply with all of that beauty, and is it enough of a beast to topple the HTC U Ultra. \nSamsung took a bold move and increased their Galaxy S8 to a much larger 5.8-inch Infinity Display compared to the 5.1-inch display used on the previous S series. Because the display uses an 18.5:9 aspect ratio that makes it taller and slightly narrower, it comes with a Super AMOLED QHD+ display and a resolution of 2960 x 1440 pixels and 570 PPI. The new display truly does go edge-to-edge and takes up 83.6-percent of the front of the phone. Samsung does set the default resolution to 2220 x 1080 to conserve battery life, but you can manually turn up the resolution to the maximum via the settings. Samsung continued the tradition of the excellent \u2018always-on\u2019 screen to help save battery life and to make it easier and quicker to check notifications. For durability, Samsung chose the newest Corning Gorilla Glass 5 to protect the display and back of the device. Samsung is the first to use the 10nm technology in the newest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 octa-core processor clocked at 2.35GHz with an Adreno 540 GPU rounding out the model destined for the US. In other countries, the Galaxy S8 will use Samsung\u2019s Exynos 8895 octa-core 10nm processor with four cores clocked at 1.7GHz and four cores clocked at 2.3GHz. The Galaxy S8 packs 4GB of DDR4 RAM and has 64GB of the faster UFS 2.1 expandable memory via a microSD card. \nSamsung used the same camera from the Galaxy S7 with a Dual Pixel 12MP sensor with Samsung deciding to instead concentrate on making advancements to their imaging software. So far, the picture quality looks excellent, but in the war of smartphone cameras, it is very surprising to see no improvements in the hardware. The Galaxy S8 uses the same large aperture of f/1.7, a 26mm lens, PDAF, LED flash, auto HDR and OIS. Samsung did make some changes to the FFC by enlarging it from a 5MP to an 8MP sensor and then added its own autofocus. It retained its wide-angle lens, the same f/1.7 aperture, and Live HDR. Samsung also kept the same sized non-removable 3000mAh battery that features Quick Charge and still offers Quick Wireless Charging. \nThe Samsung Galaxy S8 has incorporates many features \u2013 some are noteworthy and others may never be used by most owners. It comes with a useful IP68 certification, against dust and water, a heart rate monitor, an oxygen saturation sensor, and Samsung Health replaces Samsung\u2019s S-Health. Samsung\u2019s new Bixby personal assistant is much like Google Assistant; however, Bixby involves the camera as well to answer your questions. If you point it at a historical building, you will get the history of the place or aim the camera at a sign in a foreign language and Bixby will translate it for you. The Galaxy S8 still sports and a new Samsung Connect feature to tie together Samsung\u2019s appliances, SmartTVs, thermostats and other IoT (Internet of Things). Samsung added another feature that has never proven to be popular \u2013 a DeX Station that will interface the Galaxy S8 with a monitor, keyboard, and mouse for a near desktop experience. The Galaxy S8 can use both Android Pay as well as Samsung Pay, which allows Galaxy S8 users more freedom to make mobile purchases. The Galaxy S8 will come one of two ways \u2013 with Android Nougat 7.0, followed by a quick upgrade, or it may include 7.1 by release time. It measures 148.9 x 68.1 x 8.0 mm, weighs in at 155 grams, is available in Midnight Black, Orchid Gray, Arctic Silver, Coral Blue, and Maple Gold depending where you are located. The Galaxy S8 will cost about $720 outright and is now available for preorder with delivery no later than April 21. \n\u2026And The Winner Is\u2026 \nThe Final Word \nI have to give this easy win to the Samsung Galaxy S8 \u2013 not because it is a Samsung \u2013 but because it has the superior specs in just about all categories and the price for the Galaxy S8 is almost $30 cheaper than the HTC U Ultra. \nThe Galaxy S8 has a better display, much better processor and GPU, as good a camera area, same amount of RAM and memory, is physically smaller with a slightly larger display, Samsung Pay, IP68 certification, wireless charging, the same size battery, and is better looking if you must know. \nThe HTC U Ultra is a nice device and certainly has better sound than the Galaxy S8, but where else it tops the Samsung, I am having a hard time finding that weak area. If you take into account that the U Ultra costs more than the Galaxy S8, and offers less almost everywhere, it makes the Samsung Galaxy S8 the clear winner of this comparison.

MyFixGuide has torn it apart, and found that it is actually somewhat easy to take the Huawei P10 apart, although they did not give the device a repairability score like iFixit tends to do. The teardown does also confirm all of the specs that Huawei had announced with the P10, including the 3200mAh battery. \nLike most of Huawei\u2019s smartphones, the P10 uses screws to keep the back cover connected to the front of the smartphone. All you have to do is take out those screws and you\u2019ll be able to pop off the back cover and get to work. These are T2 hex screws, so they aren\u2019t as simple as removing with a philips or flat-head screwdriver, unfortunately. The back cover is one piece of metal, and Huawei has used nano-injection antenna to make sure that the signal can get in and out of the device. A common issue with metal smartphones, which is why we have those antenna lines on most metal smartphones these days. The teardown also shows that the dual cameras on the back (which are Leica branded of course) is indeed one module and not two that are next to each other. \nThe Huawei P10 is the company\u2019s newest flagship smartphone, it\u2019s their \u201csmall\u201d flagship, coming in with a 5.2-inch display, versus the Mate 9\u2019s larger 5.9-inch display. It also features the company\u2019s second-generation Leica dual-camera setup on the back. Which features a 20-megapixel monochrome sensor and a 12-megapixel RGB sensor. This is powered by the Kirin 960 processor and 4GB of RAM. All of which was found during this teardown, so there\u2019s nothing hidden or surprising here with the P10, but definitely nice to get confirmation on everything that is inside the P10, and to see how easy (or in other cases, not so easy) it is to tear down the Huawei P10.

As it turns out, it is indeed possible to build an iPhone from scratch using a hodgepodge of parts, as Allen demonstrates in the video below. He built a like-new 16GB iPhone 6s using components that were purchased in the cell phone parts markets of Huaqiangbei, China. The finished iPhone 6s is fully functional and comes complete with a working Touch ID Home button because the logic board and the Home button were purchased together. Allen didn't save any money building an iPhone from the ground up -- on reddit , he says he spent \"well over $1,000,\" but that ended up including extra parts, components that broke, or tools that were unnecessary. He thinks approximately $300 worth of parts actually went into the iPhone. Because iPhone 7 parts were still difficult to find when he embarked on the project, Allen chose to build a previous-generation iPhone 6s. While most of the parts weren't too difficult to obtain, he says it was hard to get his hands on a logic board. He also had help from many of the vendors who sold the parts during the assembly process. Allen outlines his experience building the iPhone in the video above, but additional details on sourcing the components and the assembly process can be found on his blog .", "crawled": "2017-04-13T01:11:23.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-13T01:11:23.000+03:00", "uuid": "fbea07ba5ba5e8609e3793c3782a845d8c63d37d", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 978, "likes": 978}, "gplus": {"shares": 3}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}}, "country": "US", "site": "macrumors.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://feeds.macrumors.com/MacRumors-All", "uuid": "fbea07ba5ba5e8609e3793c3782a845d8c63d37d", "section_title": "MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - All Stories", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 9, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTT_S6x0widpmkY8apq3v3WLdohCKqqpmyK7I4aMuGwCyxWOCmyxmSFn82dXIidFxk0DQl19ytWZGtngpCiXPY5", "domain_rank": 1213, "main_image": "https://img.youtube.com/vi/leFuF-zoVzA/0.jpg?retina", "site_full": "www.macrumors.com", "title_full": "This Functional iPhone 6s Was Built Entirely From Spare Parts Bought in China", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "This Functional iPhone 6s Was Built Entirely From Spare Parts Bought in China", "published": "2017-04-13T01:11:23.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "china"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "huaqiangbei"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "shenzhen"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "scotty allen"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "allen"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "juli clover"}], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTT_S6x0widpmkY8apq3v3WLdohCKqqpmyK7I4aMuGwCyxWOCmyxmSFn82dXIidFxk0DQl19ytWZGtngpCiXPY5", "author": "Juli Clover", "external_links": [], "title": "This Functional iPhone 6s Was Built Entirely From Spare Parts Bought in China", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Massive medical records breach leaves 918K seniors vulnerable By Mark Jones, Komando.com 14,630 14.6k \u00a9 Flynt | Dreamstime.com \nThere isn't a much scarier thought than having your personal information stolen. Cybercriminals are hiding around every digital corner, trying to get their hands on data they'll use to rip us off. \nSometimes, it doesn't even feel safe to go to the grocery store. Now, visiting the doctor could put your digital life at risk. How your medical records could be at risk \nWhat we're talking about is a massive data breach that was recently discovered. A backup database belonging to the telemarketing company, HealthNow Networks, was found unsecured after being uploaded to the internet. The company provides equipment and medical supplies to patients with diabetes. \nThe personal information of nearly 1 million patients was left exposed online. Unprotected data included: Patient names Health insurance information Health condition information including medications and required equipment \nThe exposed database was used by HealthNow to market products to diabetic patients. As of 2015, the telemarketing company is no longer a registered business. \nAfter the unsecured database was recently discovered, the software developer in charge of handling it deleted it. However, it's unknown how long the data was exposed and how many cybercriminals were able to pull information from it. \nPatients impacted by the breach had health insurance through Aetna, Cigna, Blue Cross Blue Shield and UnitedHealthcare. \nThe type of information exposed in this breach would be a goldmine to scammers. On top of the potential for identity theft, scammers could create phishing attacks based on patients' needs, tricking them into clicking on maliciously targeted messages that could lead to a number of horrifying results. \nAny time there is a major breach like this, you need to be extra cautious with your online security. Here are some security suggestions: What you need to do after a data breach Investigate your email address - Have I Been Pwned is an easy-to-use site with a database of information that hackers and malicious programs have released publicly. It monitors hacker sites and collects new data every five to 10 minutes about the latest hacks and exposures. Change your password - Whenever you hear news of a data breach, it's a good idea to change your account passwords. Read this article to help you create hack-proof passwords . Close unused accounts - Here's an easy way to manage all of your online accounts at once . Beware of phishing scams - Scammers will try and piggyback on huge breaches like this. They will create phishing emails, pretending to be the affected company, hoping to get victims to click on malicious links that could lead to more problems. Take our phishing IQ test to see if you can spot a fake email . Manage passwords - Many people use the same username and password on multiple sites. This is a terrible practice and you should never do it. If you're using the same credentials on multiple sites, change them to make them unique. If you have too many accounts to remember, you could always use a password manager. Keep an eye on your bank accounts - You should be frequently checking your bank statements, looking for suspicious activity. If you see anything that seems strange, report it immediately. Check email security settings - Make sure the email account associated with the hacked site has updated security settings. Have strong security software - Protecting your gadgets with strong security software is important. It's the best defense against digital threats.

Hold the applause. After gathering a handful of journalists to what I can only imagine is the company\u2019s secret volcano lair, Apple copped to screwing up the trashcan-shaped Mac Pro, and vowed to do better.\nBut what might a newer, more modular Mac Pro look like?\nWin a trip to Amsterdam! We've teamed up with Product Hunt to offer you the chance to win an all expense paid trip to TNW Conference 2017!\nCHECK IT OUT \nDesigners at CURVED/labs took a stab at it. The conceptual design looks a lot like the Mac Mini, but in the best way possible. It features two slots for full-sized graphic cards \u2014 hello GTX 1080 \u2014 and an easily accessible area housing the processor, RAM, and storage.\nPerhaps most importantly, it can breathe. The fundamental flaw with the Mac Pro \u2014 aside from it being ignored for over three years now \u2014 was its design. The trashcan-shaped PC wasn\u2019t built for upgradability, and even the parts it shipped with caused heat issues. In the artist\u2019s rendering, the newer, Mac pro would have holes on top designed to allow hot air to escape, making this a far better option than the existing Mac Pro \u2014 even though it doesn\u2019t exist.\nIt\u2019ll have Touch ID for power, a Touch Bar for\u2026 something, I\u2019m sure, and ports out the wazoo: USB-C, USB-A, and HDMI.\nIt\u2019s sort of a Mac-lovers wet dream. I\u2019d buy this right now. Sadly, though, we\u2019ll all have to wait. Some rumors suggest the product won\u2019t be done until 2019. It\u2019s kind of odd, really, as the iPod \u2014 arguably Apple\u2019s most innovative creation \u2014 was designed, manufactured, and shipped in all of nine months.\nTaking on the Mac Pro is a solved problem \u2014 PC gamers have been building high-powered rigs for years. I can\u2019t, for the life of me, figure out how it can take this long to design a new PC.\nBut, then again, does anyone ever truly understand what Apple is doing?", "crawled": "2017-04-12T23:43:39.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-12T23:43:39.000+03:00", "uuid": "0bc83462113f945c77501a735ea4342e8a55bd8e", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 41, "shares": 767, "likes": 767}, "gplus": {"shares": 11}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 88}}, "country": "US", "site": "thenextweb.com", "participants_count": 0, "site_section": "", "uuid": "0bc83462113f945c77501a735ea4342e8a55bd8e", "section_title": "", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 7, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPWplkn0Www99399_fr.IcmdOobg32k67.qq_LXGPjOmsbj422UlVM4zhrEQ0vVZ5qqQchRWxCbnp8TXzwR9HB3BQOgXXZQ3nf_e.gNYLuBx4vFIy4s6aFAUCwnm5.S_Ub8AYiiMSo5cDSFdNdImOg", "domain_rank": 1761, "main_image": "https://cdn3.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/04/mac-pro-concept.png", "site_full": "thenextweb.com", "title_full": "Mac Pro concept gives us a peek at the future of upgradeable Apple products", "spam_score": 0.176, "title": "Mac Pro concept gives us a peek at the future of upgradeable Apple products", "published": "2017-04-12T23:43:39.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [], "persons": [], "organizations": []}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPWplkn0Www99399_fr.IcmdOobg32k67.qq_LXGPjOmsbj422UlVM4zhrEQ0vVZ5qqQchRWxCbnp8TXzwR9HB3BQOgXXZQ3nf_e.gNYLuBx4vFIy4s6aFAUCwnm5.S_Ub8AYiiMSo5cDSFdNdImOg", "author": "Bryan Clark", "external_links": [], "title": "Mac Pro concept gives us a peek at the future of upgradeable Apple products", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "All Three 2017 iPhones Predicted to Have 3GB of RAM and Lightning Connectors With Faster Charging Wednesday April 12, 2017 12:41 pm PDT by Joe Rossignol All three of Apple's rumored 2017 iPhone models will likely have 3GB of RAM, according to Cowen and Company analyst Timothy Arcuri. An excerpt from Arcuri's late March research note, obtained by MacRumors : In terms of memory/storage configuration, all three models will likely adopt 3GB RAM ; the 4.7\u201d/5.5\u201d will likely have the same storage options as the current iPhone 7 /7+ in 32/128/256GB while the 5.8\u201d model looks to be only offered in two memory configurations: 64GB and 256GB. Finally, the 5.8\u201d model will likely have extended battery life with two packs of batteries. Arcuri's research contradicts Taiwanese research firm TrendForce, which recently said that only the next 5.5-inch iPhone and Apple's rumored 5.8-inch iPhone with an OLED display will have 3GB of RAM . TrendForce said the next 4.7-inch iPhone will continue to have 2GB of RAM like the iPhone 7. Apple already includes 3GB of RAM in the iPhone 7 Plus , so the 4.7-inch iPhone would be the only model with increased RAM. If the prediction is accurate, it's welcomed news for customers that plan on purchasing the next 4.7-inch iPhone, rather than spending upwards of $200 more on the so-called \" iPhone 8 \" with an edge-to-edge OLED display. Increased RAM means an iPhone can store more data in memory. If you have dozens of tabs open in Safari on an older iPhone, for example, you may notice that some of the tabs refresh when you revisit them. But with increased RAM, the likelihood of Safari reloading a website you previously loaded is lower. Arcuri also corroborated KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo in saying that all three 2017 iPhone models will continue to have Lightning connectors with USB Type-C Power Delivery for faster charging. Cowen's research is based on his own checks of Apple's supply chain, so his prediction lends credence to the already-reliable Kuo. The Wall Street Journal previously said the \"iPhone 8\" will have \"a USB-C port for the power cord and other peripheral devices instead of the company\u2019s original Lightning connector.\" But the report did not provide any additional details, and it appears the Lightning connector will live on. 18 hours ago at 12:43 pm No USB-C?

A 1-wire solution is a nice theory, but it doesn't match reality, at least not for me. The reason I have cable clutter all over the place is definitely because of USB. I just bought a rechargeable bicycle rear light and a CR2032 battery recharger, both of which are Mini-USB. Even recently designed hardware like Xbox One S controllers still have micro USB. So even the USB people aren't getting their act together and moving to the latest standard. While USB may be the industry standard, it is in no way a 1-cable solution. Even if you throw out the 4 that are for connecting computer equipment, you've still got 3 that are widely used for charging (Mini, Micro, and C). So yes, Apple should change to USB-C, but until every else does too, the 1-wire charging cable is a pipe dream. Rating: 10 Votes 18 hours ago at 12:48 pm USB-C and I buy an iPhone 8.

Why do people like you enjoy defending the dumb things that Apple does?? It doesn't make sense to me. We, the consumers, lose when Apple's priority is to put propriety crap above the consumer's convenience. Do you really deny that a USB-C iPhone is better than a Lightning iPhone? Because it would be objectively better, no debate. People could actually use corded headphones across devices again, oh my!

The Hover Camera Passport can be thought of as a sort of next-generation autonomous selfie stick that's able to follow you around and capture a hands-free photo whenever you wish. It's made from a lightweight (242 grams), foldable carbon fiber material so it packs down small and can go anywhere, and it's equipped with face tracking and body tracking so it knows who to follow. The drone travels up to 17 miles per hour and can hover for 10 minutes at up to 65 feet away, so it's able to track a user that's running, walking, biking, or engaging in other similar physical activities. There's a 13-megapixel camera built in, which can also capture 4K video. Since it's a flying camera, it can capture 360 degrees of panoramic video, and it's designed to be flown right out of the box, so even people unfamiliar with drones can pick it up and fly it. The Hover Camera Passport is controlled through the Hover Camera iOS app , which provides features like a real-time video feed, quick social sharing, multiple flight modes including spin and orbit, auto follow, and picture-taking features. New features are being added to the Hover Camera Passport for its Apple Store launch, including compatibility with iMovie and Final Cut Pro X, a more user-friendly interface, and automated media editing to create small, moving clips that can be shared with family and friends. Zero Zero Robotics is offering a $499 Apple-exclusive bundle at Apple Stores , which consists of a Passport flying camera, two batteries, a charger, an adapter, and an easy-carry bag.

The launch of the new modular Mac Pro is at least a year away as development has just started, so we have no idea what the machine will look like when it's finished, but that hasn't stopped designers at CURVED/labs from dreaming up a conceptual design that includes a simple Mac mini -style box and a matching Apple-branded display. The imagined Mac Pro features a design that's entirely upgradeable, with two slots for full-sized graphics cards, rotating housing sides, and easily accessible sections for the processor, RAM, and storage. Holes on the top are designed to allow hot air to escape, and there are added features like a Touch ID power button, a Touch Bar for accessing information on included components, and USB-C, USB-A, and HDMI ports, along with a microphone and a headphone jack. Accompanying the imagined Mac Pro is a revamped 27-inch Apple \"Cinema Display\" with ultra thin bezels, an iMac -style stand, and and USB-C ports at the back. Again, this is in no way representative of what the finished Mac Pro might look like, but it does imagine features that are in line with what Apple executives have said about the Mac Pro so far. It's going to be a high-end high-throughput machine that will facilitate regular upgrades to meet the needs of Apple's pro user base. And given its modular nature, it will ship with an Apple-branded \"pro\" display. Apple is in the process of \"completely rethinking\" the Mac Pro and execs say it will take \"longer than this year\" to finish. What that means is not entirely clear, but one rumor has suggested it might not launch until 2019 . Apple has a dedicated team working on the machine, which will serve the company's \"most demanding pro customers.\" TimUSCA 19 hours ago at 12:13 pm These are always hilarious. They never look like something Apple would design because they're almost always based off of old designs that they aren't going back to. And that monitor would never even stand upright.

Affinity Gaming , an operator of 5 casinos in Nevada and 6 elsewhere in the United States, has questioned Trustwave's investigation for failing to shut down breach that directly resulted in the theft of credit card data, allowing credit card thieves to maintain their foothold during the investigation period. The lawsuit, filed in the US District Court in Nevada, is one of the first cases of its kind where a client challenges a cyber security firm over the quality of its investigation following a hacking attack. Casino Sued an IT Security Firm Affinity Gaming said it hired Trustwave in late 2013 to analyze and clean up computer network intrusions that allowed attackers to obtain its customers' credit card data. It was reported that the details on more than 300,000 credit cards used by customers in Affinity's restaurants and hotels were accessed by cyber crooks who compromised its systems. A report submitted by Trustwave in mid-January 2014 noted that the security firm had: Identified the source of the data breach Contained the malware responsible for the incident However, more than a year later after the casino operator was hit by a second payment card breach, Affinity allegedly learned from Trustwave's competing cybersecurity firm, Mandiant , that the malware had never been fully removed. The Lawsuit Filed by the Casino Operator Here's what Affinity claimed in its lawsuit filed at the end of December in the US district court of Nevada: Hiring a firm with the proper data breach response expertise, such as Trustwave held itself out to be, was of paramount importance for Affinity Gaming...Affinity isn't an IT security firm and lacks the level of expertise. With respect to the apparent data breach, Affinity Gaming was wholly dependent on and subordinate in terms of its understanding, knowledge, and capabilities, to Trustwave, relying on [it] to diagnose, investigate, and prescribe appropriate measures to address. Mandiant\u2019s forthright and thorough investigation concluded that Trustwave's representations were untrue, and Trustwave's prior work was woefully inadequate. In reality, Trustwave lied when it claimed that its so-called investigation would diagnose and help remedy the data breach when it represented that the data breach was \"contained,\" and when it claimed that the recommendations it was offering would address the data breach. Trustwave...failed to identify the means by which the attacker had breached Affinity Gaming's data security. Thus, Trustwave could not in good faith have made the foregoing representations to Affinity Gaming. However, Trustwave denies any wrongdoing. A Trustwave spokesperson told the Financial Times (FT) on Friday, \"We dispute and disagree with the allegations in the lawsuit and we will defend ourselves vigorously in court.\" Affinity Gaming is seeking a minimum of $100,000 in damages from Trustwave.

Arcuri, citing his own \"field work\" within the supply chain, said the current yield of Apple's in-house AuthenTec -based fingerprint sensor solution is low, while noting that Apple seems unwilling to use an outside solution at this time. If Apple cannot resolve these yield issues, he sees three different scenarios: \u2022 Apple removes Touch ID from the 5.8-inch iPhone entirely and relies solely on facial/iris recognition. Arcuri said this is unlikely, as it's not secure enough, risky, and would potentially create issues with Apple Pay . \u2022 Apple puts Touch ID on the back of the 5.8-inch iPhone, but in a different place than the one on the Galaxy S8, which can be hard to reach. Arcuri said this would not be a user-friendly or optimal solution to say the least. \u2022 Apple delays production of the 5.8-inch iPhone, but still announces the device in early September alongside updated 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models. Arcuri said Apple is aiming to finalize its fingerprint sensor specification by May, but if its in-house AuthenTec-based solution is not feasible due to yield issues, mass production of the tentatively named \" iPhone 8 \" could be delayed until September, compared to its usual late July to August timeframe. Arcuri still expects Apple to announce the 5.8-inch iPhone alongside updated 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch models in September, but supplies may be extremely limited or unavailable whatsoever until later in the year. That timeline echoes recent predictions from Apple analyst Brian White and investment bank Barclays . It's also a scenario that has occurred with nearly every previous iPhone launch. Last year, the iPhone 7 Plus in Jet Black was a highly popular model among customers, and shipping estimates for online orders quickly slipped to several weeks out. It wasn't until around November that it became more widely available. The device, which has also been called the iPhone X, iPhone Pro, or iPhone Edition, is expected to feature a new glass and stainless steel design , wireless charging , longer battery life , a new front-facing camera with 3D sensing capabilities , and improved water resistance . It also won't have a physical Home button . Touch ID-related yield issues may be the reason why 5.8-inch iPhone components and schematics have yet to leak from the supply chain. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus parts began to leak around March last year.

The world\u2019s most advanced poker bot just trounced all comers at a tournament last weekend in Hainan, an island province in southern China.\nA previous version of the bot defeated several top professional players in a tournament held at a Pittsburgh casino over several weeks this January. Called Libratus, it was developed by Tuomas Sandholm , a professor at Carnegie Mellon University who specializes in machine learning and game theory, along with one of his students, Noam Brown .\nThe feat was significant because poker is fundamentally different from the types of games AI researchers have tackled previously. Because an opponent\u2019s cards are hidden from view, playing well requires extremely complex strategizing (see \u201c Why Poker Is a Big Deal for Artificial Intelligence \u201d).\nA new and improved version of the CMU bot\u2014called Lengpudashi, which means \u201ccold poker master\u201d in Chinese\u2014defeated a team made up of poker-playing AI researchers at the Hainan event. Entrants played a total of 36,000 hands against the program, which runs on a supercomputer located near CMU in Pittsburgh.\n  College Dropout Says He\u2019s Cracked Self-Driving Cars\u2019 Most Crucial Component   Astronaut Facebook\u2019s Perfect, Impossible Chatbot The event was organized by Sinovation Ventures , an incubator and venture firm, partly to draw public attention to artificial intelligence but also to explore ways of commercializing the underlying technology, says Kai-Fu Lee, the firm\u2019s CEO.\n\u201cWe want to wake people up by showing how Libratus and AlphaGo are exceeding human expectations in terms of intelligence,\u201d Lee says.\nLee says there are huge opportunities for Chinese companies to employ AI techniques because their systems are often relatively unsophisticated. He adds that China has a good chance to take a lead in AI because it has many skilled engineers and a wealth of data for training advanced algorithms.\n\nA player takes on Lengpudashi at the event in Hainan. Lee also thinks the game theory techniques used to make CMU\u2019s poker-playing program have big potential in areas like trading and automated negotiations.\n\u201cPoker is an imperfect-information application, as are most real-world applications,\u201d Lee says. \u201cDemonstrating that machines can beat the best humans indicates there will be many applications.\u201d\nSmarter poker-playing algorithms are just one example of AI that can take on humans in games. Around the same time that CMU\u2019s poker bot won in Pittsburgh, another research team, made up of academics from Canada and the Czech Republic, developed a poker-playing algorithm that also defeated several professional players. And last year, researchers at DeepMind, a U.K.-based subsidiary of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, developed a program capable of playing the board game Go at an expert level. In a widely followed game, this program, called AlphaGo, defeated one of the best Go players in the world, Lee Sedol of South Korea.\nWhat game should AI researchers tackle next? Tell us in the comments. The poker competition in Hainan is just the latest example of AI technology making its way to China. DeepMind recently announced that it will take AlphaGo to a summit involving top Chinese Go players in Wuzhen, near Shanghai. The event will involve pairing human players with AlphaGo to explore opportunities for collaborative play. The DeepMind program will also take on the world\u2019s number one Go player, China\u2019s Ke Jie .\nMeanwhile, AI researchers based in China are making strides as they seek to match the progress of big U.S. tech companies.\nResearchers at Alibaba, one of China\u2019s leading Internet companies, recently published details of an impressive AI algorithm for playing the popular strategy computer game Starcraft. In collaboration with researchers at University College London in the U.K., the Chinese researchers show how several agents working together can devise surprisingly complex, high-level behavior.\nBecome an MIT Technology Review Insider for in-depth analysis and unparalleled perspective.\nSubscribe today", "crawled": "2017-04-12T17:29:35.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "uuid": "d8155b3b39202cca5708c0190955c9a38ae37b89", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 686, "likes": 686}, "gplus": {"shares": 4}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 107}}, "country": "US", "site": "technologyreview.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://www.technologyreview.com/stream/rss/", "uuid": "d8155b3b39202cca5708c0190955c9a38ae37b89", "section_title": "New on MIT Technology Review", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 6, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4nKbDUJCUNDTMkWX8nAeKS5LhguI867CYXoBojsIHrfKNNKnpg1.DSsLLgoIkonTMWjNYdSyy676.ouVSu_xVQPA6qF0QO6WL3632dhy1eZcaqGXUtQkr4msE8nqj0X8-", "domain_rank": 10416, "main_image": "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/cmupoker.jpg?cx=0&cy=38&cw=958&ch=538&sw=1200", "site_full": "www.technologyreview.com", "title_full": "A Top Poker-Playing Algorithm Is Cleaning Up in China - MIT Technology Review", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "A Top Poker-Playing Algorithm Is Cleaning Up in China", "published": "2017-04-12T03:00:00.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "china"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "canada"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "czech republic"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "south korea"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "u.s."}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "shanghai"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "wuzhen"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "u.k."}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "hainan"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "pittsburgh"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "tuomas sandholm"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "chi"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "kai-fu lee"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "lee sedol"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "deepmind"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ke jie"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "noam brown"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "lee"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "lengpudashi"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "sinovation ventures"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "cmu"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "carnegie mellon university"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "google"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "university college london"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "alibaba"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "facebook fda"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4nKbDUJCUNDTMkWX8nAeKS5LhguI867CYXoBojsIHrfKNNKnpg1.DSsLLgoIkonTMWjNYdSyy676.ouVSu_xVQPA6qF0QO6WL3632dhy1eZcaqGXUtQkr4msE8nqj0X8-", "author": "technologyreview.com", "external_links": [], "title": "A Top Poker-Playing Algorithm Is Cleaning Up in China", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "Samsung has secured the top position with a 26.1 percent share Apple is at number 2 with a decline at 16.9 percent share Huawei appeared to be the top holder in Chinese smartphone mobile brands \nSamsung's Galaxy J series propped up its sales in the first quarter of 2017, according to a recent TrendForce report , making it the only brand that saw a production volume growth in the period. The series also helped Samsung reach the top position in terms of global smartphone production volume market share, at 26.1 percent. Apple on the other hand came in at second position, with a 16.9 percent share. \nTrendForce reports 307 million smartphone units were produced for the first quarter of 2017, which is a 23 percent drop from the previous quarter. It attributes the fall to seasonality, however, predicts that production volumes are likely to remain thanks to lacklustre smartphone sales until the second half of the year. It estimates that the \"global smartphone production volume for this second quarter will register a modest single-digit growth versus the preceding three-month period.\" \nIn the last quarter (Q4 2016), Samsung managed to obtain a market share of 18.5 percent while Apple had a lead with 20.3 percent in global smartphone production volumes. For Q1 2017, Apple saw a decline in its smartphone production volume by 36 percent compared with the previous quarter. \nIn the case of Samsung, as we mentioned, the Galaxy J-series helped the company stay afloat this quarter, TrendForce claims. While its high-end smartphone sales suffered thanks to the effect of the Galaxy Note 7 debacle, Samsung's mid-range and low-end segments thrived thanks to the Galaxy J-series. \"The economically priced, high-performing Galaxy J series sustained Samsung's shipments and contributed significantly to the expansion of the brand's overall smartphone production volume,\" the report claimed. \nTrendForce also claimed that the Samsung Galaxy S8 will have a minimal impact on the market, \"Samsung has also released its flagship device for the year Galaxy S8 this second quarter. However, the high-end model is expected to make limited sales contribution because the buzz surrounding the next-generation iPhone devices is dampening demand for products from non-Apple vendors. Samsung is expected to post flat growth for its second-quarter smartphone production volume.\" \nTalking solely about the iPhone, TrendForce is estimating that the total production volume of all iPhone devices for the second quarter will reach around 43 million units, a decline of 17 percent from the preceding quarter. \"Apple will likely to lower the production of existing iPhone models as the company prepares for the launch of the next-generation devices in the third quarter,\" the report added. \nInterestingly, Apple recently unveiled the PRODUCT (RED) variants of iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus , which TrendForce says have been very well received by customers, and helped Apple boost its market share in the global scenario against its neck and neck competition with Samsung. \nBesides Samsung and Apple retaining the top two positions in global smartphone production volume market share, Huawei saw a rise in its market share securing 11.4 percent this quarter, and standing on the third spot. Oppo (8.1 percent), BBK/ Vivo (6.2 percent), and LG (4.6 percent) hold the lowest positions with significant decline in their market share compared to the previous quarter. LG's production volume plummeted by almost 40 percent compared with the prior quarter, with TrendForce citing a seasonal effect on demand. Its shipments should benefit from the arrival of the G6, the report added, predicting Q2 2017 will see 18 million smartphones produced - similar to the same period last year. \nLooking at only Chinese smartphone brands, TrendForce report reveals that they produced 141.725 million units in Q1 2017. Huawei leads with a 24.7 percent market share this quarter against its 23.6 percent in Q4 2016. At number two is Oppo with 17.6 percent, followed by BBK/ Vivo with 13.4 percent of market share. Xiaomi and ZTE are at the lowest positions with 8.1 percent and 7.8 percent market share respectively. \n\"TrendForce points out that Chinese smartphone makers in general will be able to raise their production volumes again in the second quarter as they put their latest flagship devices on the market. However, their home market China has reached a growth plateau. In addition to this, the 10th anniversary iPhone devices are generating a lot of interests and influencing consumer demand. Therefore, Chinese brands will have limited room for growth in the future. Those among them that have not establish footholds in overseas markets will be in an especially difficult position,\" reads the TrendForce report about the future of Chinese smartphone brands ", "crawled": "2017-04-12T17:24:37.000+03:00", "published": "2017-04-12T17:24:37.000+03:00", "uuid": "e52d0b5d5ad7925bfb099c5875aa7fd8aa62d09f", "thread": {"social": {"facebook": {"comments": 0, "shares": 705, "likes": 705}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}}, "country": "US", "site": "ndtv.com", "participants_count": 0, "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/NDTV-LatestNews", "uuid": "e52d0b5d5ad7925bfb099c5875aa7fd8aa62d09f", "section_title": "NDTV News  -  Special", "site_type": "news", "replies_count": 0, "site_categories": [], "performance_score": 7, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFqrSjjxZMR.q.3TCKlPESxTUNYSpcwGQZ.2Uom6Qgp6ur7gbNnnZhNCz9vCPz7ug2jsWH2Ac6HnCIAeEFoq9LiZPQ9zxCaXw4r6q9HFrBGT72lhk0zG9EpvKmAnHwlC_JM4s5b159OcIZRkMJFSVOO_tZpO19mr0ew-", "domain_rank": 306, "main_image": "https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/samsung_galaxy_j7_prime_gold_1492006323836.jpg", "site_full": "gadgets.ndtv.com", "title_full": "Samsung Said to Beat Apple to Take Lead in Global Smartphone Market Share", "spam_score": 0.0, "title": "Samsung Said to Beat Apple to Take Lead in Global Smartphone Market Share", "published": "2017-04-12T17:24:37.000+03:00"}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "rating": null, "entities": {"locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "china"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "samsung said"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "xiaomi"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "trendforce"}], "organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "apple"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "samsung"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "samsung galaxy s8"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "lg"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "huawei"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "bbk/ vivo"}]}, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFqrSjjxZMR.q.3TCKlPESxTUNYSpcwGQZ.2Uom6Qgp6ur7gbNnnZhNCz9vCPz7ug2jsWH2Ac6HnCIAeEFoq9LiZPQ9zxCaXw4r6q9HFrBGT72lhk0zG9EpvKmAnHwlC_JM4s5b159OcIZRkMJFSVOO_tZpO19mr0ew-", "author": "", "external_links": [], "title": "Samsung Said to Beat Apple to Take Lead in Global Smartphone Market Share", "highlightText": ""}, {"text": "LEARN MORE \nGoogle thinks it\u2019s cracked this problem with something called Scroll Anchoring , which is found in the newest version of Chrome.

In total, Microsoft patches 45 unique vulnerabilities in its nine products, including three previously undisclosed vulnerabilities under active attack. The first vulnerability ( CVE-2017-0199 ) under attack is a remote-code execution flaw that could allow an attacker to remotely take over a fully patched and up to date computer when the victim opens a Word document containing a booby-trapped OLE2link object. The attack can bypass most exploit mitigations developed by Microsoft, and according to Ryan Hanson of security firm Optiv, in some cases, exploits can execute malicious code even when Protected View is enabled. As The Hacker News reported Monday, this code-execution flaw in Microsoft Word was being exploited by hackers to spread a version of infamous Dridex banking trojan . Also, according to blog posts published Tuesday by security firms FireEye and Netskope , hackers are exploiting the same Word vulnerability to install Latentbot and Godzilla malware respectively. Microsoft has released a fix for CVE-2017-0199 and credited Hanson with responsible reporting the critical vulnerability to the company. Patch for Critical IE Flaw Being Exploited in the Wild The company also pushed out a patch for another critical vulnerability (CVE-2017-0210) under active attack. The flaw is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Internet Explorer that would allow an attacker to trick a victim into visiting a compromised website. The vulnerability could allow the attacker to access sensitive information from one domain and inject it into another domain. \"The vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary code to be run. However, the vulnerability could be used in conjunction with another vulnerability (for example, a remote code execution vulnerability) that could take advantage of the elevated privileges when running arbitrary code,\" Microsoft's guidance for the flaw reads. This IE vulnerability is also being exploited in the wild. Another Critical Word Vulnerability Yet Unpatched! The third previously undisclosed flaw (CVE-2017-2605) resides in the Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) filter in Microsoft Office, but Microsoft did not actually release an update for this flaw in Tuesday's update batch. However, the tech giant issued an update for Microsoft Office that, by default, disable the EPS filter in MS Office as a defense measure. This Word vulnerability is also being exploited in the wild when a target opens a malicious EPS image in Word. \"Microsoft is aware of limited, targeted attacks that could leverage an unpatched vulnerability in the EPS filter and is taking this action to help reduce customer risk until the security update is released,\" the guidance for the flaw reads. The company also issued a patch for Windows 10 Creators Update, which was made available on Tuesday, addressing some remote code execution flaws and elevation of privilege bugs. In total, Microsoft rolled out 15 security updates on Tuesday patching dozens of unique CVEs in its products, including the Windows OS, Exchange Server, Edge and Internet Explorer, Office, Office Services and Office Web Apps, Visual Studio for Mac Silverlight and Adobe Flash. Users are strongly advised to install updates as soon as possible in order to protect themselves against the active attacks in the wild on three separate Microsoft products.
