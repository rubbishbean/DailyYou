Apple has already confirmed it is working on new iMac models for release later this year, but today's report offers another hint at what could be in store for creative pros and puts a more specific timeframe on those plans. According to the report, production of two new iMacs is said to begin next month, with a view to launching the consumer desktops between August and October and a \"server-grade model\" at the tail end of 2017. Apple currently has a 21.5-inch and a 27-inch iMac available in the market and the new products are expected to be the upgrades of the two models and are expected to hit the market in the third quarter to catch up with the year-end holiday season. The report comes from DigiTimes , which has a mixed track record when it comes to rumors, but with Apple already having taken the unusual step of confirming it is working on new iMac models for a late 2017 release, this latest information presents a reasonable timeline. In addition, the technical details from the supply chain line up with previously leaked specs for Apple's upcoming upgrades. According to Tuesday's report, the high end iMac will feature Intel's as-yet-unreleased Xeon E3-1285 v6 processor, options for 16 to 64GB error-correcting ECC RAM, up to 2TB NVM Express PCI-e solid-state storage, and more ambiguously, a \"latest discrete graphics card\". Typically, iMacs include a mobile-class GPU rather than a desktop-class card, so this last spec could refer to either, while AMD has a contract with Apple to supply the discrete graphics chips for future high-end 27-inch iMacs. The new iMacs for 2017 are said to be manufactured by Quanta Computer, which is expected to remain the largest all-in-one PC maker in 2017. The earlier report detailing identical tech specs claimed Apple's new iMacs would be accompanied by a brand new keyboard. A previous report said Apple was exploring a standalone keyboard with a Touch Bar and Touch ID , but its release is said to depend on how well those features have been received on the latest MacBook Pro. The original source of the iMac tech specs, Pike's Universum , also claimed Apple is working on an 8K external display, which would presumably feature as part of the company's highest end iMac offering. All iMacs are expected to ship with USB-C ports and Thunderbolt 3 connectivity.", "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "tim hardwick apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pike", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [], "organizations": [{"name": "ecc ram", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "universum", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "apple", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "digitimes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "quanta computer", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "amd", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gpu", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "intel", "sentiment": "none"}]}}, {"url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTT_S6x0widpmkY8apq3v3WLdohCKqqpmy65bAHTIOEHOmwFDZ5OnGgeUWakuBKI4BQCGLWf.rRlQ--", "rating": null, "thread": {"replies_count": 0, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZTT_S6x0widpmkY8apq3v3WLdohCKqqpmy65bAHTIOEHOmwFDZ5OnGgeUWakuBKI4BQCGLWf.rRlQ--", "domain_rank": 1213, "title_full": "New Drone Footage Shows Nearly Complete Apple Park Campus at Night", "published": "2017-04-20T03:41:36.000+03:00", "main_image": "https://cdn.macrumors.com/article-new/2017/04/applecampusatnight-800x442.jpg?retina", "spam_score": 0.0, "social": {"linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 944, "comments": 0, "shares": 944}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 2}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "site_full": "www.macrumors.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://feeds.macrumors.com/MacRumors-Front", "site_categories": [], "title": "New Drone Footage Shows Nearly Complete Apple Park Campus at Night", "site": "macrumors.com", "performance_score": 9, "site_type": "news", "uuid": "c2f7cfe98995829d37ad3af5383ee864a0855678", "country": "US", "section_title": "MacRumors: Mac News and Rumors - Front Page"}, "published": "2017-04-20T03:41:36.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "author": "Juli Clover", "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightText": "", "crawled": "2017-04-20T03:41:36.000+03:00", "title": "New Drone Footage Shows Nearly Complete Apple Park Campus at Night", "external_links": [], "language": "english", "uuid": "c2f7cfe98995829d37ad3af5383ee864a0855678", "text": "New Drone Footage Shows Nearly Complete Apple Park Campus at Night Wednesday April 19, 2017 4:30 pm PDT by Juli Clover Apple Park , Apple's second campus in Cupertino, California, is set to have its grand opening this month, and ahead of its official debut, last minute construction and landscaping is continuing on at a rapid pace. As part of a mid-month update, drone pilot Duncan Sinfield has shared a new video of Apple Park, this time getting some gorgeous nighttime shots of the campus lit up at night. In the evenings, the lights on the ring-shaped main building stay on, and it's an impressive sight. The nighttime shots are towards the end of the video, which also shows the completed parking structures, landscaping work with hundreds of trees being planted, final construction on the main building, furniture installation, and more. While employees are set to start working at Apple Park at some point in April, landscaping and construction on auxiliary buildings will continue into the summer. jclo 19 hours ago at 05:17 pm I live near Cupertino and it's hard to grasp the scale from the drone video. It looks straight up amazing at night. Rating: 4 Votes coolfactor 20 hours ago at 04:53 pm remember HP also had a massive campus and they are not the same company anymore. This all started happening 7 years ago with the purchase of land from HP http://www.mercurynews.com/2010/11/24/apple-makes-big-land-purchase-in-cupertino-2/ But was HP's campus inspiring, designed and built with the planet and people in mind? Or was it just a boring corporate box surrounded by pavement? I think that's a very important distinction. Apple has always had unique values from the very beginning, and I think that influences their course. Rating: 3 Votes zoetmb 20 hours ago at 04:46 pm With just 11 days left to the month, I doubt very much that any employees are moving into the main building this month. Employees may start moving in in May, but there's tons of work left to do. Just getting the construction equipment off of the site would take several weeks. I bet it would take days just to get that orange safety netting off the top of the building. All those very large cartons sitting inside the building must be office modules and the like. All of that has to be put together. This place is huge. Lots of work still to do and the place will need to be cleaned top to bottom to get rid of construction dust before employees move in. And I don't know specifically what California's laws are, but I would assume the place needs a certificate of occupancy. I can't see the authorities granting that until most of that interior space is cleared of construction and packaging debris. All of these videos have shown very light traffic on the highways, so I assume they're shot on Sundays, probably early Sunday mornings. And so we also see relatively few construction workers. Anyone familiar with the site during the week? Are there a thousand construction workers there? Because it seems to me that's what it would take to get it ready for move-in if it's happening before June.

On March 16, Apple filed a permit for the \"full removal of the glass cubical structure at the Apple Store entrance,\" which, according to BuildZoom, was granted on April 17. The removal of the cube will cost Apple $2 million, and according to a second source, could commence on May 9. Apple is planning to expand its Fifth Avenue store to double the size of the original location. The store is growing from 32,000 square feet to 77,000 square feet, giving Apple more space at its flagship New York location. It is not yet clear what Apple is planning to do with the cube. It could be temporarily removed to allow for construction underneath, or the company could have bigger cube renovation plans in mind. This will be the second time the cube has been dismantled -- it was torn down in 2011 to allow Apple to reconstruct it from larger, more seamless glass panes. Prior to 2011, the cube was made up of more than 90 glass panes, but the new cube uses just 15. While construction is underway at the new location, Apple has temporarily relocated the store to a nearby empty storefront that formerly housed the FAO Schwarz toy store. Apple has not announced when the new store will be complete, but rumors suggest it will have some notable improvements, including a unique area for a Beats 1 radio station that will enable live in-store Beats 1 broadcasts. 13 hours ago at 01:09 pm How does the removal of the cube cost $2 million?

The Mi 6 is the latest flagship from Xiaomi, and is their first device with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. \n\nThe Xiaomi Mi 6 features a design that incorporates both glass and metal. The stainless steel mid frame of the device is sandwiched between four-sided curved glass on the front and back. There is also an exclusive variant which comes with a ceramic back and comes with 18K gold rims around the two rear camera lenses . The front of the device also sports the 5 .15\u2033 FHD display , which Xiaomi claims comes with 4096 levels of brightness which allows for finer control of display brightness. The Mi 6 also comes with an under-glass fingerprint sensor . Xiaomi also claims that the device is splash-resistant with the SIM tray sealed against splashes, but fails to provide any IP-level protection on the device.\n\nOn the inside, the Xiaomi Mi 6 sports the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835, along with 6GB LPDDR4x RAM by default across all variants. For internal storage, the Mi 6 comes in a 64GB variant and a 128GB variant , but there is no microSD expansion to be found on this phone. The device comes with a decently-sized 3,350 mAh battery with Quick Charge 3.0 functionality. Given the screen size, resolution and the Snapdragon 835 with its 10nm process, the Mi 6 should be able to provide some good battery life. The Mi 6 also comes with full NFC functionality and Bluetooth 5.0 , but lacks a 3.5mm headphone jack . Xiaomi was also strangely silent on the MIUI version and Android version that the device will ship with.\n\nThe Mi 6 also comes with a dual camera setup on the back. This setup consists of a 12MP wide angle camera with 4-ais OIS and a 12MP telephoto camera that helps in capturing photos with background \u00e0 la Portrait Mode on the iPhone 7 Plus. The front camera on the device is a 8MP shooter. \nThe Mi 6 will be available from April 28, 2017 in China through Mi.com, Mi Home stores and other partner sites.

The move is said to be a repercussion of CEO Evan Spiegel's alleged India-related remarks. \nThe Independent reported the Snapchat user data claims by anonymous Indian hackers, but there no publicly visible claims made by any Indian hacking group so far taking responsibility. Snapchat has since denied the user data leak was done, the report adds. \nAfter massive outrage, Snapchat has been denying that Spiegel said anything about India. According to a Variety report, CEO Evan Spiegel said the app was \"only for rich people\" and not for \"poor countries like India and Spain\". The Snapchat app has since received massive outrage on Twitter as hashtag \"UninstallSnapchat\" and \"BoycottSnapchat\" have been trending. \nVariety report had cited a former Snapchat employee who claimed that CEO Evan Spiegel had no interest in expansion in different markets , and allegedly said that the \"app [Snapchat] is only for rich people,\" adding that he didn't want to \"expand into poor countries like India and Spain.\" \nThe remark claims has put a dent on Snapchat's App Store ratings which dropped to a single star .

At the event in Beijing, the company highlighted a few new features of the Mi 6 such as its premium 3D glass design, powerful Snapdragon 835 SoC, 6GB of RAM, and dual rear cameras, among other things. Priced at CNY 2,499 (roughly Rs. 23,500) for the 64GB storage and 6GB RAM variant, the smartphone looks to improve on its predecessor, and we take a look at six key Xiaomi Mi 6 features that stand out for the new flagship. Xiaomi Mi 6 design \nXiaomi in recent years has managed to package its smartphones with attractive design elements that please the eyes. With the Xiaomi Mi 6 standing as the flagship smartphone for 2017, the company has gone all out to make a good-looking handset. One of the main highlights of the Mi 6 is its four-sided 3D curved glass with an ultra reflective mirror finish being offered in Blue, Black and White options. Xiaomi has also paid a lot of attention to symmetry. The card slot and volume keys on either sides are perfectly aligned, while the antenna lines are aligned to the display. The bottom sees speaker grilles on either side of the USB Type-C port and no 3.5mm headphone jack. Xiaomi has also kept the back as clean as possible for a mirror-like effect with only a dual camera setup on the top left and the 'Mi' logo on the bottom. The sides of the phone are made from stainless steel for a high-gloss outline. There is also a Ceramic variant. Xiaomi Mi 6 processor \nAs one would expect from a flagship smartphone, the Xiaomi Mi 6 is powered by the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC based on the 10nm manufacturing process. The smartphone is also offered with 6GB of RAM which is large enough to handle multitasking, gaming and pretty much anything you want to throw at it. The latest SoC consumes 25 percent less power as compared to the Snapdragon 820, which translates to a longer battery life for the Mi 6. The SoC also provides Gigabit LTE speeds. Xiaomi Mi 6 dual camera \nThe Mi 6 is touted as the first 5.15-inch smartphone to sport a dual camera setup on the back. The rear sees a pair of 12-megapixel lenses, one wide angle and one telephoto that allows you to have 2x optical lossless zoom. This essentially means that you will be able to capture clear, detailed images even with 10x digital zoom. The rear also features a 4-axis OIS stabilisation system so you won't have to worry about shaky hands getting in the way of that perfect capture. Notably, the dual camera also promises to deliver great depth-of-field captures and uses binocular imaging system and deep learning algorithm to clearly define what needs to be focused and what should be blurred out. Xiaomi Mi 6 fingerprint sensor \nXiaomi has once again managed to push the fingerprint sensor under the glass of the fingerprint sensor front, which is something it had done for the Xiaomi Mi 5s , using ultrasonic technology. According to the company, this implementation will help ensure the fingerprint scanner will not get damaged with use and wear and tear. Bluetooth 5.0 \nBluetooth 5.0 is the next generation in Bluetooth technology. Xiaomi's Mi 6 joins Samsung's Galaxy S8 as being the only two smartphones currently to support Bluetooth 5.0. Xiaomi may not have stressed on this particular feature much but the technology is pretty impressive when compared to the fourth generation Bluetooth technology. Bluetooth 5.0 gives 4x the range, 2x the speed and 8x broadcasting capacity compared to the previous generation. Notably, the new technology is also strong enough to connect the phone to two speakers simultaneously. Stereo speakers \nLastly, Xiaomi took some time to highlight the Mi 6's dual speakers on the top and bottom that the company promises will help deliver immersive stereo effect. The dual speakers aims to deliver a surround sound experience while playing music, video or games.", "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "xiaomi", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xiaomi mi", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "beijing", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "xiaomi", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "ndtv", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "xiaomi mi 5s", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "samsung", "sentiment": "none"}]}}, {"url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPWplkn0Wwwy0buwGT2AQ2Y7uxlU91dFmzaY7SFZ1gDZ8MG7k3hd0FT3JcpWPrifijRYGrNk1G5bYJROVK1Wlc8PKww4J7kWjGiNh3lVo5UfEzA_3fxmV0T.RAQtPJmQQMWE2R9YoVAs_HcUYlt.67", "rating": null, "thread": {"replies_count": 0, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPWplkn0Wwwy0buwGT2AQ2Y7uxlU91dFmzaY7SFZ1gDZ8MG7k3hd0FT3JcpWPrifijRYGrNk1G5bYJROVK1Wlc8PKww4J7kWjGiNh3lVo5UfEzA_3fxmV0T.RAQtPJmQQMWE2R9YoVAs_HcUYlt.67", "domain_rank": 1761, "title_full": "Facebook\u2019s Messenger Platform 2.0 will be your one-stop-shop for work, play and social", "published": "2017-04-19T00:04:31.000+03:00", "main_image": "https://cdn3.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/04/Messenger20featured.png", "spam_score": 0.147, "social": {"linkedin": {"shares": 106}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 695, "comments": 12, "shares": 695}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "gplus": {"shares": 23}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "site_full": "thenextweb.com", "participants_count": 0, "site_section": "", "site_categories": [], "title": "Facebook\u2019s Messenger Platform 2.0 will be your one-stop-shop for work, play and social", "site": "thenextweb.com", "performance_score": 6, "site_type": "news", "uuid": "3ae23172e320b285695452c9620f27da327f670c", "country": "US", "section_title": ""}, "published": "2017-04-19T00:04:31.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "author": "Matthew Hughes", "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightText": "", "crawled": "2017-04-19T00:04:31.000+03:00", "title": "Facebook\u2019s Messenger Platform 2.0 will be your one-stop-shop for work, play and social", "external_links": [], "language": "english", "uuid": "3ae23172e320b285695452c9620f27da327f670c", "text": "CHECK IT OUT \nOn stage at the McEnery Convention Center in San Jose, David Marcus, VP of Messaging Products, laid bare the company\u2019s vision for messenger. It\u2019s exciting. You can tell, because Facebook isn\u2019t launching another one-point-something version. This is Messenger Platform 2.0. \nSo, what does Messenger Platform 2.0 look like? One theme is Messenger not merely as a tool for social interactions, but a tool for business. David Marcus said that there are 65 million businesses on Messenger. \nMessenger Platform 2.0 emphasizes discovery, with an aim to make it easier to discover those businesses. It aims to be the Yellow Pages of chat apps. A tangible step forward towards this is the Discover Tab, which is populated with relevant bots and businesses. \nIn the same spirit, Facebook is also overhauling Messenger Codes. These launched last year as a way to connect different Messenger users, but didn\u2019t really catch on in the west. That\u2019s a cultural thing. We\u2019re not particularly used to scanning QR codes and the like on a routine basis. \nThese are now easier to use. The company\u2019s Parametric QR codes can be placed anywhere, and can be scanned with Messenger to engage with bots and companies. \nBots also made an appearence, with chat extensions. Previously, bots were things you engaged with one-on-one. Now, you can drag them into group conversations. Spotify is an early adopter here. You can now use it to share tracks within group conversations. \nAlready, there are several major companies signed up, including Uber, the Wall Street Journal, Hipmunk, Kayak, and more. \nAnother major announcement is Smart Replies, which allows small businesses to launch their own intelligent autoresponders. These can answer questions when the social media team are off duty, allowing customers to find out basic details like locations, pricing, and opening hours at any time. \nAlthough announced a little bit earlier, a component of Messenger Platform 2.0 is M Suggestions. This is found in M \u2014 the company\u2019s virtual assistant platform \u2014 and is used to make recommendations about things to do, stickers to use, and so on. \nGames also seen a major overhaul. According to David Marcus, 1.5 billion games have been played over Facebook Messenger, so now the company is introducing rich, real-time and turn-by-turn games. It\u2019s also introducing a games tab, which makes it easier to discover new titles. \nIt\u2019s clear where Facebook is going. It wants Messenger to be a one-stop-shop for everything you do. Work. Play. Social. Cupertino desperately wants Messenger to do it all. \nAnd given what we saw in San Jose, it\u2019s clear to see they\u2019re on the right track.", "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "david marcus", "sentiment": "negative"}], "locations": [{"name": "mcenery convention center", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "san jose", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "facebook", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "parametric", "sentiment": "none"}]}}, {"url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFqrSjjxZMR.q.3TCKlPESxTUNYSpcwGQZ9nSh8tRLLxhfX.bjWic2oophExeBXfr0kVjMREqE5lqSoLWRHdIQhFyTz9Y3L33LRgBIQycqJKGRYsqJXoRISixxcvFsGHvWJiNA2.ifeWUA--", "rating": null, "thread": {"replies_count": 0, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_DuQb1SwTFqrSjjxZMR.q.3TCKlPESxTUNYSpcwGQZ9nSh8tRLLxhfX.bjWic2oophExeBXfr0kVjMREqE5lqSoLWRHdIQhFyTz9Y3L33LRgBIQycqJKGRYsqJXoRISixxcvFsGHvWJiNA2.ifeWUA--", "domain_rank": 306, "title_full": "Xiaomi Mi Max 2 Images Leak Ahead of Expected Wednesday Launch", "published": "2017-04-18T10:04:50.000+03:00", "main_image": "https://i.gadgets360cdn.com/large/mimax2_main_1492498261850.jpg", "spam_score": 0.0, "social": {"linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 636, "comments": 0, "shares": 636}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "site_full": "gadgets.ndtv.com", "participants_count": 0, "site_section": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/NDTV-LatestNews", "site_categories": [], "title": "Xiaomi Mi Max 2 Images Leak Ahead of Expected Wednesday Launch", "site": "ndtv.com", "performance_score": 6, "site_type": "news", "uuid": "65cbb65a9a5c093de4fc830f0fe76c61f7a7af84", "country": "US", "section_title": "NDTV News  -  Special"}, "published": "2017-04-18T10:04:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "author": "", "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightText": "", "crawled": "2017-04-18T10:04:50.000+03:00", "title": "Xiaomi Mi Max 2 Images Leak Ahead of Expected Wednesday Launch", "external_links": [], "language": "english", "uuid": "65cbb65a9a5c093de4fc830f0fe76c61f7a7af84", "text": "Xiaomi Mi Max 2 Images Leak Ahead of Expected Wednesday Launch Mi Max 2 seen to sport a fingerprint sensor at the back It is expected to launch alongside Mi 6 on Wednesday It is seen to sport a USB Type-C port \nXiaomi is set to launch the Mi 6 flagship at an event in Beijing on Wednesday, and alongside it, the Chinese manufacturer is also rumoured to launch the Mi Max 2 . Just a day ahead of the launch, the Mi Max 2 render images have been leaked, and it gives us a fair idea on the design details of the device. \nThe images were leaked on Weibo, and they unfortunately do not reveal the front of the device. The Mi Max 2 is seen sporting a full-metal body, with the camera and flash situated on the top left corner at the back. Furthermore, the images reveal dual speaker grilles at the bottom edge of the device and a USB Type-C port. The 3.5mm audio jack is seen on the top of the device, and the fingerprint scanner is situated in the centre at the back, just like its predecessor. Apart from the Micro-USB to USB Type-C port change, there's hardly any design difference from its predecessor. Notably, the camera and flash placement has been reversed. \nPast leaks suggest that the phone will come in variants 4GB RAM + Snapdragon 626 SoC and 6GB RAM + Snapdragon 660 SoC and will be priced between CNY 1,499 (roughly Rs. 14,000) and CNY 1,699 (roughly Rs. 15,900) respectively. \nThe rumour mill also tips that the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 will run Android 7.1.1 Nougat out-of-the-box and will sport a 6.44-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) display. The phone is expected to house a large capacity 5000mAh battery. In terms of optics, the smartphone has been tipped to feature a 12-megapixel rear camera with Sony IMX378 sensor and a 5-megapixel camera at front for taking selfies. Earlier, the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 was expected to be launched by the company in May.

Apple says the company is working on a \"closed-loop supply chain\" that would allow it to stop mining the earth for rare minerals and metals. \"One day, we'd like to be able to build new products with just recycled materials, including your old products,\" Apple says on its updated Environment site. In an interview with VICE , Apple vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives Lisa Jackson commented on the mining plan, saying \"it's where technology should be going.\" \"We're actually doing something we rarely do, which is announce a goal before we've completely figured out how to do it,\" Apple's Vice President of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives and a former head of the EPA, Lisa Jackson, told VICE News during an exclusive visit to Apple's environmental testing lab on Monday. \"So we're a little nervous, but we also think it's really important, because as a sector we believe it's where technology should be going. Much of what goes into an iPhone isn't recycled, but Apple wants to change that by more aggressively using components taken from old iPhones and combining that with \"high quality recycled metals\" purchased from suppliers. Apple will double down on investments like Liam , the robot that breaks iPhones down into component parts, and it plans to continue to encourage customers to return products through the Apple Renew recycling program. While Apple plans to source more of its materials from recycled goods, Jackson says that though a \"product that lasts is really important,\" the company doesn't have plans to make its devices easier to repair to increase longevity. Jackson also defended Apple's history of making products that are hard to repair. Allowing customers to repair Apple products themselves \"sounds like an easy thing to say,\" she said. But \"technology is really complex; it is sophisticated to make it work, to ensure that you have security and privacy, [and] that somebody isn't giving you bad parts.\" Because of this, Apple won't be taking a \"right to repair\" approach to meeting its environmental goals. \"All those things mean that you want to have certified repairs,\" Jackson said. Other environmental milestones are also outlined in Apple's report. 96 percent of the power used by Apple facilities around the world comes from clean energy sources, and as has been the case for several years, 100 percent of the electricity that powers Apple data centers comes from solar, hydro, and wind energy sources. Apple now has seven suppliers that have committed to using renewable energy, and the company plans to help suppliers bring 4 gigawatts of renewable power online by 2020. When it comes to packaging, more than 99 percent of the packaging used for Apple products is responsibly sourced. Virgin paper is sourced from protected sustainable forests, and the company has successfully protected or created enough working forests to cover all of its packaging needs. Lisa Jackson's full comments on the 2017 environmental report can be read over at VICE , and Apple's full Environmental Responsibility Report, which goes into much more detail on its recycling efforts, packaging, water usage, and carbon footprint, is available here . 21 hours ago at 05:17 pm \"Climate change\" Even if you don't believe in climate change or are dead set against \"the liberal agenda,\" why are you against humans being resourceful instead of wasteful?

The upcoming Mi 6 smartphone is expected to launch alongside the Xiaomi Mi 6 Plus, a larger variant, while the Mi Max 2 is also expected to be unveiled at the same event. Xiaomi Mi 6 launch event live stream \nYou can watch the Xiaomi Mi 6 launch live stream on the company site. Ahead of the launch, Mi 6 has been leaked on several occasions, and teasers have separately hinted at dual rear cameras and 6GB of RAM. Also anticipated are thin bezels. Xiaomi Mi 6 price and variants \nAs for leaks, let's start with the Xiaomi Mi 6 price. The Mi 6 will reportedly be launched in 4GB of RAM + 64GB storage and 4GB + 128GB variants, priced at CNY 2,199 (roughly Rs. 20,500), and CNY 2,599 (roughly Rs. 24,300), respectively. The bigger Xiaomi Mi 6 Plus , on the other hand, is tipped to be offered in 6GB of RAM + 64GB, 6GB + 128GB, and 6GB + 256GB variants, which will reportedly be priced at CNY 2,699 (roughly Rs. 25,000), CNY 3,099 (roughly Rs. 28,990) and CNY 3,699 (roughly Rs. 34,600), respectively. Xiaomi Mi 6 specifications \nThe big highlight of the Mi 6 is said to be the latest Snapdragon 835 processor integration. It is said to be a big upgrade from the Xiaomi Mi 5, and it is also tipped to sport a dual-edge curved display - at least on one premium variant. \nFrom what we know so far, the Xiaomi Mi 6 runs on Android 7.1.1 Nougat - based on a heretofore unreleased version of MIUI, the company's custom ROM. It will feature a 5.1-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixel) display. Xiaomi has confirmed that there will be 6GB of RAM on board, however it will be available in several RAM/ storage bundles listed above. As for camera, the Mi 6 is tipped to sport a 12-megapixel rear camera with 4K video recording support and an 8-megapixel front snapper capable of 4K recording as well. \nMeanwhile, the Mi 6 Plus flagship has been tipped to sport a Quad HD 2K OLED display with dual curved edges and dual rear camera setup, while the Mi 6 will allegedly sport a flat display. Both the flagships are expected to come with Qualcomm's Quick Charge 4.0 technology for fast charging support. The smartphone is also expected to house a 4000mAh battery, although this will likely be for the Mi 6 Plus. Xiaomi Mi Max 2 \nFinally, we come to the Xiaomi Mi Max 2 , which is the successor to the Mi Max phablet. Past leaks suggest that the phone will come in variants 4GB RAM + Snapdragon 626 SoC and 6GB RAM + Snapdragon 660 SoC and will be priced between CNY 1,499 (roughly Rs. 14,000) and CNY 1,699 (roughly Rs. 15,900) respectively. \nThe Xiaomi Mi Max 2 is tipped to run Android 7.1.1 Nougat out-of-the-box and sport a 6.44-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) display. The phone is expected to house a large capacity 5000mAh battery.

After all, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ both have the tough task to deal with large, high-res displays and they have a very powerful system chip (for this test, we have the Exynos 8895 version of the phones, we will test the Snapdragon 835 model at a later point in time), both factors that could potentially consume a lot of power. We have tested the Exynos Galaxy S8 and S8+ model To find out about the Galaxy S8 and S8+ battery life, we put them through our standard test that allows us to compare all phones on equal grounds: with the screen set to the same level (200 nits of brightness, comfortable for typical indoor use). Luckily, the Galaxy S8+ does very well in this test and even though it is not the number one battery performer, it is certainly above the average for flagships these days. Note that we have tested using the Full HD+ resolution that our phones came set to by default (1080 x 2220 pixels). Samsung Galaxy S8+ battery test result Battery life (hours) Samsung Galaxy S8+ 8h (Excellent) Samsung Galaxy S8 8h 22 min (Excellent) Samsung Galaxy S7 edge 7h 18 min (Good) Samsung Galaxy S7 6h 37 min (Average) Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9h 5 min (Excellent) Apple iPhone 7 7h 46 min (Good) LG G6 6h 20 min (Average) Google Pixel XL 7h 19 min (Good) OnePlus 3T 5h 41 min (Average) Huawei P10 7h 42 min (Good) View all The Galaxy S8 and S8+ get similar, but not equal battery life test results. The Galaxy S8+ Exynos model that we tested scored exactly 8 hours , while the more compact S8 Exynos version topped this with a score of 8 hours and 23 minutes. Interestingly, the Snapdragon model of the Galaxy S8 scored less than the Exynos version: it went 10 minutes short of 8 hours. Compare this with the 7 hours and 18 minutes that the already very good Galaxy S7 Edge scored, and you see that Samsung has managed to improve on their last year's phone. The S8 and S8+ also best the Google Pixel XL, the OnePlus 3T, but fall a bit short of the battery life on the iPhone 7 Plus. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ battery will last you through even a very busy day In a nutshell, both the Galaxy S8 with its 3,000 mAh cell, as well as the S8+ with its 3,500 mAh battery run a long time. On a separate note, we have recently noticed that more affordable phones, especially ones with the 14nm Snapdragon 625 system chip, do remarkably well in terms of battery life . In fact, we often get envy-worthy 2-day battery longevity on these phones, while the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are not quite in that territory. Still, when we speak about flagship grade devices, the Galaxy S8+ is definitely among the best out there. With a phone like this, you can be assured that you will get through a busy full day and still have juice left, even if you are a power user, and that is definitely reassuring.

Apple is challenging Apple Watch owners to complete a 30 minute outdoor exercise activity on Earth Day, which is Saturday, April 22. For finishing the challenge, Apple Watch owners will be rewarded with an exclusive Earth Day award and stickers that can be used in the Messages app. Get outside and celebrate Earth Day on April 22 and earn this award.

Rating: 5 Votes Kaibelf 14 hours ago at 12:45 pm My favorite earth day commemoration from Apple was when they decided that enabling a longer lifespan for these machines is important to reduce waste and additional resources used in the manufacturing process, so they started to build the computers and phones in a way that is easily maintained and upgraded by the user. This showed they really, actually cared about the environment, and not just the bottom line. Give it a rest. I have a 2006 model iMac in my home right now that still works perfectly well with no issues, and I'm sure I'm not the only one who can attest to the fact that their hardware outlives most of the competition easily.

When I was in business school we did a case study on a company where the manager would give one employee every week a cash bonus of one penny. Office morale and productivity went up not because of the monetary value, but because everyone wants to be recognized. Badges and emoji gives you a tangible short term goal to work toward and a reward for achieving it. That's all it takes to motivate some people, including myself.

However, this apparently isn't working in all cases, so Samsung is allowing an exchange to happen at service centers.\nAs to the cause of the color balance problem, the culprit is thought to be 'deep red' OLEDs. Samsung uses two subpixels in the S8's OLED display, which break down to red-green and blue-green. So as to offset the potential color balance problem of too much green, Samsung strengthened the red color. The red tint suggests they overdid it.", "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}}, {"url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPWplkn0Wwwy0buwGT2AQ2Y7uxlU91dFmzaY7SFZ1gDZ0xXKrvyBc2bmsxSUL.j3uL.vjxl8MkkAqkhGiWeX9YgCMSvSNXiTKdIi9wjGJkn2eNrcC011Mm", "rating": null, "thread": {"replies_count": 0, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZSPWplkn0Wwwy0buwGT2AQ2Y7uxlU91dFmzaY7SFZ1gDZ0xXKrvyBc2bmsxSUL.j3uL.vjxl8MkkAqkhGiWeX9YgCMSvSNXiTKdIi9wjGJkn2eNrcC011Mm", "domain_rank": 1761, "title_full": "Here\u2019s what you missed at Facebook\u2019s #F8 keynote (Day 1)", "published": "2017-04-19T00:11:28.000+03:00", "main_image": "https://cdn2.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2017/04/zuckerberg-f8-2017.png", "spam_score": 0.0, "social": {"linkedin": {"shares": 138}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 522, "comments": 4, "shares": 522}, "pinterest": {"shares": 6}, "gplus": {"shares": 13}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "site_full": "thenextweb.com", "participants_count": 1, "site_section": "http://feeds2.feedburner.com/thenextweb", "site_categories": [], "title": "Here\u2019s what you missed at Facebook\u2019s #F8 keynote (Day 1)", "site": "thenextweb.com", "performance_score": 5, "site_type": "news", "uuid": "8090ffe42725b3a70509c5f3494ffded61b5ebc5", "country": "US", "section_title": "The Next Web"}, "published": "2017-04-19T00:11:28.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "author": "Bryan Clark", "ord_in_thread": 0, "highlightText": "", "crawled": "2017-04-19T00:11:28.000+03:00", "title": "Here\u2019s what you missed at Facebook\u2019s #F8 keynote (Day 1)", "external_links": [], "language": "english", "uuid": "8090ffe42725b3a70509c5f3494ffded61b5ebc5", "text": "shares \nF8 , Facebook\u2019s annual developer conference, is underway. \nThe keynote kicked off the event on a weird note, as a giggly Mark Zuckerberg took the stage to make dad jokes about the \u201cother\u201d F8 \u2014 the eighth movie in the Fast and the Furious franchise: The Fate of the Furious.

The Galaxy S8 ships in a stylish all-black box with nothing, but the letters 'S8' in luscious, glossy blue at the front. Open the box and inside we find one of the most comprehensive and richest sets of mobile gear available. No wonder, this is one truly premium flagship (with a truly premium price). The first thing that you see when you open the box of the Galaxy S8 is the phone itself. We have the Midnight Black version and it looks stunning, with a thin, elegant profile and a much taller and narrower body and display. It's surprising how its 5.8-inch display in this taller body results in a phone that is not as wide as traditional phablets, and is still easy to hold in one hand and to use. We take the foil off and start up the phone, but while we wait, let's take a look at what is inside the box... Pair of AKG ear-buds with 2 additional silicon pads (L and M size) Samsung 'Adaptive Fast Charging' wall charger (9V at 1.67A, or 5V at 2A) USB-C to USB-A cable SIM ejector tool User manuals A cool new detail with the Galaxy S8 is that everything inside the box is black: you have a black wall charger, black cables, even black adapters (it's a glossy black, not matte, in case you are wondering). This is a change from earlier Samsung devices where all these accessories were white. Of course, the coolest new accessory in the Galaxy S8 box is the pair of AKG ear buds, a much higher quality set of headphones than the ones that usually come with phones. You get two additional rubber silicone pads with a large and a smaller size to better fit your ear. The buds have a weird, alien-like form and fit comfortably in the ear, and you also have a controller on the chord with a mic. We will take a separate look at these headphones in a separate post, but we're definitely happy to find them in the box. Samsung also include a handy USB-C to traditional USB-A adapter that is useful if you want to transfer data from a flash drive to your phone, and you get a microUSB to USB-C adapter that ensures that you can use an older microUSB cable or an older power bank with a microUSB cable. The 'Adaptive Fast Charging' wall brick is conveniently small and powerful. It starts by delivering 15 watts of power to your phone (9V at 1.67A), and towards the end of the charge switches to a 10-watt output (5V at 2A). Using this charger you will be able to top up your battery quicker than with a regular charger. The rest is manuals and other technical literature that you probably won't even open, but for what it is the Galaxy S8 is a very comprehensive package and comes with all the necessary accessories that we can think of. Great job, Samsung.
