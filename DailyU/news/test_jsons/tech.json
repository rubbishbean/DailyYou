Ars Technica reports on vintage computing hobbyists \"resurrecting digital communities that were once thought lost to time...some still running on original 8-bit hardware.\" Sometimes using modern technology like Raspberry Pi and TCPser (which emulates a Hayes modem for Telnet connections), they're reviving decades-old dial-up bulletin board systems (or BBSes) as portals \"to places that have been long forgotten.\" An anonymous reader writes: One runs the original software on a decades-old Commodore 128DCR. Another routes telnet connections across a real telephone circuit that connects to a Hayes modem. And after 23 years, the Dura-Europos BBS is back in business, using an Apple IIe running its original GBBS Pro software -- augmented with a modern CFFA3000 compact flash drive, and a Raspberry Pi running TCPser. Ars Technica blames \"the meteoric rise of the World Wide Web and the demise of protocols that came before it\" for the death of the BBS. \"Owners of older 8-bit machines had little reason to maintain their hardware as their userbase migrated to the open pastures of the Web, and the number of bulletin board systems plummeted accordingly... \"Despite the threat of extinction, however, it turns out that some sysops never quite gave up on the BBS ,\" and for many modern-day users, \"it's simply a matter of 'dialing' the BBS using a domain name and port number instead of a phone number in their preferred terminal software.\" There they'll find primitive BBS games like STARTREK, Chess, and Blackjack, but also \"old conversation threads dating back decades were available verbatim... It's like a buried digital time capsule.\" One user says visiting a web site today \"has a very public feel to it, whereas a BBS feels very much like being invited into someone's living room.\" The article also remembers \"the dulcet tones of a 1200 baud connection (or 2400, if you were very lucky),\" adding that \"to see what was accomplished with so little was simply humbling.\" ", "thread": {"participants_count": 0, "site_categories": ["news", "tech"], "uuid": "c00de865888ec26c266063a82182b89ac3442ebe", "replies_count": 0, "title": "Die-Hard Sysops Are Resurrecting BBS's From The 1980s - Slashdot", "title_full": "Die-Hard Sysops Are Resurrecting BBS's From The 1980s - Slashdot", "section_title": "", "site": "slashdot.org", "spam_score": 0.272, "published": "2017-04-09T05:18:18.778+03:00", "country": "US", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQzUUrlS9adJ57FMRDPJQ9zlZTqDHNhKRwmF.8GZJlurACAPlKrny5pkENe.7IU5m467.EueiE.a8bmM7gMMBAzE81rKzruLqmTdU5LB4cAEEPgTtHHmPaq_IA6lkxrqm4-", "performance_score": 9, "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 10}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 46}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 982, "shares": 982}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}}, "domain_rank": 2202, "site_section": "", "site_full": "tech.slashdot.org", "site_type": "news", "main_image": "https://a.fsdn.com/sd/topics/internet_64.png"}, "title": "Die-Hard Sysops Are Resurrecting BBS's From The 1980s - Slashdot", "crawled": "2017-04-09T05:18:18.778+03:00", "author": "", "uuid": "c00de865888ec26c266063a82182b89ac3442ebe", "published": "2017-04-09T05:18:18.778+03:00", "external_links": [], "rating": null, "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "entities": {"organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "ars technica"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "slashdot"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "blackjack"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ars technica"}], "locations": []}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZQzUUrlS9adJ57FMRDPJQ9zlZTqDHNhKRwmF.8GZJlurACAPlKrny5pkENe.7IU5m467.EueiE.a8bmM7gMMBAzE81rKzruLqmTdU5LB4cAEEPgTtHHmPaq_IA6lkxrqm4-"}, {"text": "Hackers are attacking Word users with new Microsoft Office zero-day vulnerability The bug affects all supported versions of Microsoft Word, including users of Windows 10. | Topic: Security \n(Image: file photo) \nAttackers are exploiting a previously undisclosed vulnerability in Microsoft Word, which security researchers say can be used to quietly install different kinds of malware -- even on fully-patched computers. \nUnlike most document-related vulnerabilities, this zero-day bug that has yet to be patched doesn't rely on macros -- in which Office typically warns users of risks when opening macro-enabled files. SECURITY Read More \nInstead, the vulnerability triggered when a victim opens a trick Word document, which downloads a malicious HTML application from a server, disguised to look like a Rich Text document file as a decoy. The HTML application meanwhile downloads and runs a malicious script that can be used to stealthily install malware. \nResearchers at McAfee, who first reported the discovery on Friday, said because the HTML application is executable, the attacker can run code on the affected computer while evading memory-based mitigations designed to prevent these kinds of attacks. \nBoth McAfee and FireEye, which posted a similar report Saturday but that it had held off on a public disclosure while it was coordinating a response with Microsoft, both agreed on the cause of the vulnerability. The issue relates to the Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) function, which allows an application to link and embed content to other documents, according to researchers. The Windows OLE feature is used primarily in Office and Windows' in-built document viewer WordPad, but has been the cause of numerous vulnerabilities over the past few years. \nThe researchers recently focused a Black Hat talk on the Windows OLE attack surface. \nThe researchers said the bug can be exploited on all versions of Office, including the latest Office 2016 running on Windows 10, and have spotted attacks in the wild since January. \nNews of the bug comes less than a week before Microsoft's regularly scheduled Patch Tuesday, where the company releases security fixes and patches for its range of products. \nIt's not known if, however, Microsoft will fix this zero-day bug by Tuesday. \nA Microsoft spokesperson did comment when reached prior to publication.

There are two ways to keep your identity secret while making a call: one is permanent; the other is temporary on a call-by-call basis. \nBlocking your number temporarily only works while calling businesses and individuals.

Dial that code before the phone number, and it will temporarily deactivate caller ID. On the receiving end, caller ID will usually display \u201cprivate number\u201d because it has been blocked. \nThe process is a little more in depth if you want to permanently disable the feature. Just call your cellphone carrier and ask for a line block. Once it\u2019s done, your phone number will never appear, no matter who you call. But don\u2019t choose this option lightly because it is permanent and irreversible. \nThe code to call your mobile carrier can vary, but customer service in the United States can usually be reached by calling 611. \nIf you temporarily want your mobile number to appear from a private number, you can dial *82 (star 82) before dialing the number you're calling.

Toutiao\u2019s headquarters in Beijing. Recommended for You Self-Driving and Electric Cars Are Going to Have Tons of Strange Effects on Society \nInside the offices of Toutiao, it\u2019s hard to tell you\u2019re just outside of Beijing and not in the heart of Silicon Valley. \nThe walls are decorated with stylish graffiti, and there are all the usual perks: a game room, a gym, and a sumptuous cafeteria. But Toutiao doesn\u2019t only look the part. The company makes an insanely popular Chinese news aggregation app called Toutiao (meaning \u201cheadlines\u201d). Toutiao boasts some 700 million users in China, with more than 68 million active daily users. The company gets most of its revenue from advertising, which is also tailored to users\u2019 likes and interests. \nToutiao\u2019s parent company, Bytedance, has grown at a dramatic rate. In 2014 Bytedance sought investment that valued it at about $500 million. With its latest fund-raising round, the company is reportedly seeking a valuation in excess of $10 billion. \nThe success of Toutiao has been achieved, in large part, by using machine learning to figure out users\u2019 interests and tastes, and tailoring its offerings accordingly to get more clicks. Facebook and Twitter also use machine learning to refine recommendations, but they rely more heavily on social connections. \nWhen you open the app, you\u2019ll see a stream of posts, ranging from serious news reports to cute videos. The more you click, the more Toutiao learns your tastes and interests, and refines its recommendations. Toutiao was created in 2012 by Zhang Yiming, a 33-year-old entrepreneur. \nWhen I first opened the app, I was presented with a broad range of content. The top story was a post about coming economic reforms. This was followed by a piece on the level of pollution in Beijing that day, and then a video of a popular stand-up comedian talking about the smog. Further down was a salacious story about a famous actress having an affair, and, curiously, an article on how to discern the sex of newborn chickens (I\u2019m told this was aimed at rural readers). \nIn the coming year, Toutiao aims to develop more AI-focused services, and to expand internationally. The ultimate goal is to become the world\u2019s number-one online content destination, eclipsing the likes of Facebook and Twitter, as well as the likes of the New York Times and Buzzfeed in their own markets. \nIndeed, signs of high-tech hustle were everywhere when I visited last month. Scores of coders, designers, and marketers were busy working away in a modern, open-plan space, with desks arranged around a futuristic-looking circular glass meeting room. In one corner, a pile of several hundred unpacked ThinkPad laptops sat ready for new employees to claim. \nI met with Lei Li, who heads up Toutiao\u2019s AI lab, having joined the company from another Chinese Internet company, Baidu, in March of last year. Besides developing better ways of determining what posts to recommend to users, Li\u2019s team has created an artificial reporter, called Xiaoming, that\u2019s capable of generating short news reports on European soccer games. Li\u2019s team is also working on ways to identify users that might be able to answer specific questions, with a view to offering a service similar to Yahoo Answer or Quora. Toutiao opened this problem up to outside researchers with a contest held in December. \n\u201cWe really want to use machine learning to understand question-and-answering and comments and news,\u201d Li told me. \u201cToutiao Lab\u2019s mission is to push the boundaries of machine learning and AI and to transfer that into products.\u201d \nToutiao already has several ways of identifying fake news. In China this mostly consists of dubious health recommendations. It does this using a mix of human reviewers along with automated analysis of posts and comments related to them. \nLi also argues that Toutiao\u2019s way of surfacing content results is less of a filter bubble than is often seen on Facebook, where people are often exposed only to posts from those with whom they already agree. This involves designing the recommendation algorithms to offer some content even if a user hasn\u2019t signaled a preference for it so far. \u201cOur [machine learning] models will try to expand your horizons, your interests,\u201d says Li. \nJie Tang, a professor at China\u2019s Tsinghua University who studies information diffusion and social network dynamics, says as Toutiao becomes more popular it will become increasingly important for it to make recommendations that are accurate and compelling. He says the company may also need to generate more of its own content. \u201cYou need something new,\u201d he says. \nToutiao is already working on this. Besides linking to outside content, a growing number of posts and videos come from those posting directly on Toutiao\u2019s platform. Users include news outlets, government agencies, and celebrities. \nTo some degree, the emergence of Toutiao symbolizes China\u2019s transition from a low-wage, low-tech manufacturing powerhouse to a more technologically sophisticated market. Appropriately enough, the company\u2019s headquarters are located in what used to be an aerospace manufacturing factory. \nBytedance also offers an English-language app called TopBuzz. Its future strategy will include investing in and partnering with local media companies. Last year it invested $25 million in an Indian aggregator called Dailyhunt. The company is also looking for revenue opportunities outside of advertising. Last September, Toutiao signed a deal with JD.com, a Chinese e-commerce site, allowing users to buy products through the app. Current investors in Toutiao include Sequoia Capital China and the Russian billionaire Yuri Milner. \nUltimately, Li says, the company\u2019s efforts to expand internationally will be informed by the work his team is doing. \u201cMany of the lessons we have learned can be shared for our international products,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have built the largest machine-learning platform for content. That\u2019s our weapon.\u201d \nEditor\u2019s note: This article was updated February 2, 2017, to reflect Toutiao\u2019s latest user figures.

While the Russian embassy in Madrid announced Levashov's arrest on Sunday, it did not confirm the reason for his arrest. This is the second arrest made by the Spanish authorities since the US 2016 election. In January, the police detained Stanislav Lisov , 32, on suspicion of creating and operating the NeverQuest Banking Trojan and possibly influencing the presidential election in Donald Trump's favor. US authorities are planning to request the extradition of both hackers to the United State, where they are facing charges for their hacking-related crimes. During an interview with Russian press agency RT, Levashov's wife Maria said that her husband was held \"at the request of the American authorities in connection with cyber crime.\" Maria spoke with Spanish officials, who mentioned \"something about a virus that was supposedly created by [her] husband\" and was related to Trump's victory in last year's presidential race. Western security researchers have identified Levashov as Peter Severa (aka Peter Levashov) \u2013 the man who has also been listed in the world's Top 10 Worst Spammers maintained by anti-spam group Spamhaus , which has given him the 7th position in the list. Peter Carr, a spokesperson for the Criminal Division of the US Department of Justice, told the news agency that \"the US case remains under seal, so [they] have no information to provide at this time.\" The US government has repeatedly accused Russia of hacking Democratic party and leaking personal data in order to influence election results in favor of Donald Trump, though Russian officials have repeatedly denied the accusations.

Now it is sifting through it for clues to new drugs. by Antonio Regalado June 21, 2016 \n\"Welcome to You.\u201d So says the genetic test kit that 23andMe will send to your home. Pay $199, spit in a tube, and several weeks later you\u2019ll get a peek into your DNA. Have you got the gene for blond hair? Which of 36 disease risks could you pass to a child? See the Rest of the Package 50 Smartest Companies \nRun by entrepreneur Anne Wojcicki, the ex-wife of Google founder Sergey Brin, and until last year housed alongside the Googleplex, the company created a test that has been attacked by regulators and embraced by a curious public. It remains, nine years after its introduction, the only one of its kind sold directly to consumers. 23andMe has managed to amass a collection of DNA information about 1.2 million people, which last year began to prove its value when the company revealed it had sold access to the data to more than 13 drug companies. One, Genentech, anted up $10 million for a look at the genes of people with Parkinson\u2019s disease. This story is part of our July/August 2016 Issue Subscribe HOW IT WORKS People who sign up for 23andMe submit a spit sample. The DNA in stray cheek skin cells is analyzed for some 650,000 genetic markers. These markers reveal which common version of each human gene a person has, about 20,000 genes in all. Such \"genotypes\" may explain many physical traits and disease risks, although not all. WHAT YOU WILL LEARN Inherited Disease Risk Thirty-six genes that put your children at risk for inherited disease, including:-Niemann-Pick disease Traits Twenty-two genes that explain your appearance or characteristics, including: -Cheek dimples Wellness Six genes that reveal differences related to food, exercise, and sleep, including: -Sensitivity to alcohol Ancestry The overall composition of your genes reveals a person\u2019s ancestry, including: -Countries of origin -Relatives who share DNA -Percentage of Neanderthal genes Banned in U.S. The U.S. still bars certain genetic findings from being provided directly to consumers, including: -BRCA breast cancer gene -Risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease -Risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease -Response to hepatitis C treatment \nThat means 23andMe is monetizing DNA rather the way Facebook makes money from our \u201clikes.\u201d What\u2019s more, it gets its customers to pay for the privilege. That idea so appeals to investors that they have valued the still-unprofitable company at over $1 billion. \u201cMoney follows data,\u201d says Barbara Evans, a legal scholar at the University of Houston, who studies personal genetics. \u201cIt takes a lot of labor and capital to get that information in a form that is useful.\u201d \nThe company almost didn\u2019t survive to build its database. In 2013, the U.S. government forced 23andMe\u2019s flagship health test off the market when it charged, in one of the angriest letters the Food and Drug Administration has ever sent to a private company, that the company\u2019s gene predictions were inaccurate and dangerous for those who might not fully understand the results. \nWojcicki apologized and continued offering more limited ancestry tests. But she never really changed her idea. By last fall, the government agreed to allow some health information back on the market\u2014for example, letting customers know whether they\u2019re carriers of risk genes like the one that causes cystic fibrosis. Wojcicki has vowed she \u201cwill not sleep\u201d until the full results (which once included estimates of a person\u2019s risk for diabetes, macular degeneration, and breast cancer) are available again. \nTo some, 23andMe\u2019s strategy is controversial for the way it treats personal data as a commodity. But \u201cprescient\u201d may be a better word. Even the U.S. government is catching up. President Obama\u2019s Precision Medicine Initiative will begin inviting citizens to join its own one--million-strong database this year. And just like 23andMe, it must find ways to entice the public to join. \nFor now, though, 23andMe\u2019s biobank is the world\u2019s largest repository of DNA samples that also contains extensive health information, willingly provided by customers who answer survey questions like \u201cDo you like cilantro?\u201d and \u201cHave you ever had cancer?\u201d 23andMe says its customers supply it with as many as two million new facts each week. These surveys are proving valuable to drug investigators. This year the company found genetic variations strongly linked to whether customers consider themselves early risers, offering a clue about how to develop drugs that modulate alertness. \nWhen it receives a spit sample, 23andMe examines about 650,000 locations in its customer\u2019s genomes. That\u2019s not as detailed (or expensive) as generating a complete, letter-by-letter genome map. Yet the technology captures the big picture of which genes a person has. It allows 23andMe to tell you, for instance, that your eyes are probably blue rather than brown. \nTo gain the volume of information necessary to study specific diseases, 23andMe has recruited patients by giving the test away for free. One person who joined the database is Amy Caron, who was diagnosed with lupus, an autoimmune disorder, at age 22. Caron agreed to submit her DNA as part of a study of lupus financed by Pfizer. Very little is known about the disease, and filling out surveys \u201cis a safe, low-risk way to get involved and contribute,\u201d she says. \nThis spring 23andMe also opened a drug lab, where it will begin testing some of its own treatment ideas. It\u2019s the first time the company has done work at a lab bench rather than a computer screen, says Joyce Tung, the company\u2019s vice president of research. To some observers, finding drugs is the only way 23andMe can justify the value investors have given it, since the company has never turned a profit from its tests. \nAnother reason 23andMe can\u2019t stand still is that genetic technology keeps advancing, and it keeps getting cheaper. That means lots of companies are offering low-priced gene tests. One even promises to fully decode a person\u2019s genome for $1,000. Yet unlike 23andMe\u2019s test, these must be ordered by a doctor, in order to avoid regulations covering direct-to-consumer medicine. \nWojcicki still believes the public is able to deal with the sort of complex information that can be gleaned from DNA \u201c without a middleman in a white coat delivering it,\u201d as she recently told the Wall Street Journal . Instead, it\u2019s 23andMe that\u2019s in the middle. Cut off? Read unlimited articles today.

An Android Wear 2.0 Developer Preview is available already, and in its fifth version since January 2017. Find out how you can get the Developer Preview up and running over at the Google Android Wear Developers page . \nWe gave Android Wear 2.0 Developer Preview a test run with the futuristic Huawei Watch. Check out the video below to hear our thoughts and see the new version of the OS in action. \nMost notably, Android Wear 2.0 can run standalone apps, meaning the watch doesn't need to be in range of a smartphone for an app to work. This makes Android Wear more independent, striking out from the impression people have of smartwatches being expensive and unnecessary smartphone accessories. \nWith cellular support, Android Wear 2.0 lets you make calls, use OK Google, and more without relying on your phone being nearby. Not only that, the latest update to smartwatches brings support for Google Assistant, which we first saw with the release of its Pixel smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL , in addition to Android Pay. Complications, features showing data from apps, can now be shown on any watch face. / \u00a9 Google \nMessaging saw an improvement through handwriting recognition, smart reply, and a swipe-enabled keyboard. Google placed many of its products at I/O under the umbrella of its machine learning expertise, and here things are no different. All three of these input methods are held up by Google's AI. And, although a keyboard may seem a poor choice of input on a screen so small, Google hopes that its machine learning algorithms are powerful enough to predict the words you want based on just the first letter or two that you enter. The three messaging input methods on Android Wear 2.0. / \u00a9 Google \nWhen it comes to fitness, Google is providing interaction between fitness apps through the Google Fit API. This effectively allows apps to exchange information, such as calories burned and consumed, creating a more holistic experience. There's also activity recognition, so when you begin running, this can automatically be detected by a running app, which can begin timing your run, or counting your calories burned, for example. \nThere's also a Material Design overhaul of the Android Wear interface. This can be seen immediately in how notifications appear. Android Wear 2.0 sees a Material Design visual overhaul. / \u00a9 Google When is my smartwatch getting the Android Wear 2.0 update? \nNewer smartwatches like the LG Watch Sport and Watch Style and the Huawei Watch 2 are shipping with Android Wear 2.0, but many older smartwatches will get the update as well. \nThere is no word yet on when others will be receiving Android Wear 2.0. Google has indicated that it's the manufacturers who are deciding on when devices receive the upgrade, so the blame for delays can be squarely placed on the companies. Opinion by Brittany McGhee It is disappointing that it hasn't rolled out to more watches by now What do you think? 50 25 participants \nAndroid Wear 2.0's features will breathe new life into older smartwatches starting in February 2017 when the roll out begins. The OTA updates will happen gradually throughout the year.

Luckily, there are different computer tools to help with choosing the right one. FormatFactory might very well become a valuable solution to all those who struggle to convert multimedia files, because it works on every Windows version out there and has a lot of features. Support for a wide range of file formats Before talking about the interface, it needs to be mentioned that the app supports a lot of formats, as FormatFactory is able to convert video files, audio and pictures into all kinds of formats such as MP3, AVI, 3GP, MKV, MOV, MMF, AMR, M4A, MP2, ICO, TIF, PCX, TGA and others. Clean feature lineup The interface is both appealing and well organized, and although the app is able to process numerous file formats, it is also incredibly easy to handle. All the main features are nicely organized in the left part of the main window, while the conversion process is detailed in the center. In case you are not entirely satisfied with the interface, you can also go for another color theme, as the application also comes with a few other skins for more exigent users. Ripping features In addition to format conversion, the software application can be used to rip DVDs and CDs , or to create ISO files based on user-selected discs. You can even compress the ISO files and generate CSOs, depending on your choice. Joining options After or before converting your video or audio tracks, you can choose to join the files and obtain a large one than can be played on your device. FormatFactory can stitch together files of the same format, while still allowing you to adjust the output quality and size. When dealing with very large files that take a lot of time to convert or join, you can set FormatFactory to shut down the PC when the process ends and you can leave the computer, so that you are not compelled to stick around to turn it off manually. A reliable and efficient convertor All in all, FormatFactory should be your number one pick when converting a file, thanks to the numerous formats it supports, as well as the functions it provides.

Some beauty companies, especially small ones, simply buy ready-made formulations from contract manufacturers, add an ingredient and fragrance, and put them on the market. \nLiving Proof takes a more scientific approach. Though the Cambridge, Massachusetts, hair-care company has only about 60 employees, it creates all of its products in-house, many based on patented, proprietary materials invented in its labs. \u201cInstead of trying to improve an off-the-shelf formulation, we think about the end result we want the consumer to have, and we reverse-engineer a formula that will deliver those benefits,\u201d says Living Proof\u2019s vice president of product development, Ron McLaughlin. \nThe company was founded in 2005 by two MIT biomedical professors ( among others ) to use science to address common beauty challenges. Today, Living Proof sells 42 shampoos, conditioners, styling creams/sprays, and specialty treatments in 32 countries. It keeps its processes confidential, but recently let MIT Technology Review visit its labs to learn how it invents new technologies and creates its products. Living Proof\u2019s discovery lab scientists use long locks of human hair, known as tresses, to evaluate raw materials and compare their performance to those of competing brands. \nIdentifying unmet needs \nLiving Proof typically launches a new product every three months. The company\u2019s scientists and marketers derive ideas from a number of sources, including trade shows, hair stylists, and consumer feedback. Once a product concept is approved, Living Proof usually creates and releases it within 14 months. \nProprietary technology \nMost Living Proof products incorporate one of the company\u2019s three proprietary molecules: OFPMA, PBAE, and ETAS. OFPMA stands for octafluoropentyl methacrylate, a material that the company calls its \u201chealthy hair molecule\u201d because it helps reduce surface energy on hair and protects it from moisture and friction, thus decreasing frizz and oil. PBAE is short for poly beta-amino ester, a polymer that Living Proof has dubbed its \u201cvolumizing molecule\u201d because it deposits microscopic \u201cdots\u201d onto hair strands that make hair look and feel thicker. ETAS, Living Proof\u2019s \u201cvolumizing and texturizing molecules,\u201d are expandable, textured aero-spheres\u2014tiny, air-filled spheres that are sprayed onto hair to create volume and texture. Living Proof has patents on OFPMA and PBAE and has applied for a patent for ETAS. Living Proof\u2019s product development lab contains dozens of materials that its chemists use to formulate new products. \nThe discovery lab \nLiving Proof has three labs in its headquarters. It conceives most of its proprietary ingredients in a \u201cdiscovery lab,\u201d where it conducts fundamental research. The company likes to adopt molecules that have never been used in beauty products before. For example, the technology underlying PBAE was invented in the lab of MIT professor and Living Proof cofounder Robert Langer to transfer foreign DNA to host cells for gene therapy. After Living Proof found ways to apply the technology to hair, it decided to license the chemistry from MIT and use it to create a styling polymer of the same name. \nTo spur innovation, Living Proof intentionally hires scientists who have worked in diverse fields outside the beauty industry\u2014such as cancer research and pharmaceuticals. It employs analytical chemists, biologists, biomedical engineers, chemical engineers, pharmacists, and polymer scientists. The company also meets regularly with Langer and its other MIT cofounder, Daniel Anderson , to share data and map its strategy. A tableau of most of the ingredients used in Living Proof\u2019s Perfect Hair Day Dry Shampoo, which was released in 2015. A Living Proof in-house stylist applies the company\u2019s dry shampoo to a model in the company\u2019s test salon. \nConcocting product recipes \nWhile Living Proof\u2019s discovery lab scientists hunt novel technologies, the company\u2019s formulation chemists use existing materials to develop new products. The formulas, which generally take two to four months to design, are a mix of proprietary molecules and off-the-shelf ingredients, including surfactants for making shampoos and emulsifiers for making creams. \nFor example, Living Proof\u2019s dry shampoo spray contains four powders that absorb oil and sweat, two powders that prevent the formula from settling and packing into the bottom of the product\u2019s canister, three types of fragrance, a chemical that neutralizes odors, alcohol to keep the formula liquid, and OFPMA. Most of those materials are widely available, but the addition of OFPMA makes the product unique because it enables the powders to fall out of a user\u2019s hair after spraying\u2014and thus remove oil and sweat without water\u2014instead of clumping onto strands and causing further buildup. Inside Living Proof\u2019s analytical lab, where the company conducts its quality assurance tests. \nThe test salon \nThough Living Proof\u2019s chemists devise their formulations inside a lab, the company tests them on real people as soon as the mixtures are deemed safe for human exposure. These experiments can take place in the company\u2019s office, in partner stylists\u2019 salons, or in consumers\u2019 homes. Living Proof\u2019s headquarters include a small test salon, where two stylists try out upcoming products on people plucked from a database of 3,000 volunteers. The company estimates that 40 to 50 people participate in these trials in an average week. Living Proof\u2019s scientists assess the test salon results using a grading scale and consider consumer and stylist comments when they finalize their formulations. \nStability and quality analysis \nAfter Living Proof formulates a new product, it subjects it to three months of stability testing during which the mixture is frozen, thawed, and heated to 45 \u00b0C (113 \u00b0F) to ensure it can withstand extreme temperatures. Living Proof also tracks product quality during manufacturing, which is handled by outside companies located in Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York. Though these contractors employ their own testers, Living Proof requires them to send it samples of the top and bottom portions of each product batch. (Batches typically run 4,000 to 6,000 kilograms, which is large enough to make 50,000 bottles of shampoo.) Living Proof uses a rotator to invert product samples, extract the active materials, and verify that their dosages are accurate. \nManufacturing samples go to Living Proof\u2019s analytical lab, where scientists examine the molecular weight, purity, and stability of individual components to make sure the batch has been mixed correctly. These evaluations can catch mistakes, such as too much air in the formulation, an incorrect level of active ingredients, or contamination from a previous batch. If the error is minor, the batch can be reworked; if it\u2019s major, the batch gets discarded. Living Proof uses this spectrophotometer, which has an infrared beam splitter inside, to quickly analyze samples. \nLiving Proof conducts these tests using techniques and instruments common in pharmaceutical development, such as high-performance liquid chromatography systems and infrared spectrophotometers. The scientist in charge of Living Proof\u2019s analytical lab was formerly a process chemist at the pharmaceutical company Merck. \nProof tests \nAll personal care companies do market research, develop new materials, and engage in quality testing to some degree. What sets Living Proof apart is its advanced biotechnology and materials science. Since this R&D isn\u2019t visible or easily comprehensible to consumers, the company constructs \u201cproof tests\u201d to demonstrate its products\u2019 characteristics. These tests might use a fluorescence microscope to show sebum (oil) on hair fibers or a scanning electron microscope to visualize surface damage to hair. Living Proof places these images on store posters and its website to illustrate how its products work. Living Proof took these fluorescent images to show how its dry shampoo absorbs and removes sebum from dirty hair. \n", "thread": {"participants_count": 0, "site_categories": ["tech", "education", "business"], "uuid": "2ac5d55539f10001893ae9d87914925609e34edf", "replies_count": 0, "title": "The Science Behind Your Volumizing Shampoo - MIT Technology Review", "title_full": "The Science Behind Your Volumizing Shampoo - MIT Technology Review", "section_title": "", "site": "technologyreview.com", "spam_score": 0.159, "published": "2017-04-09T10:04:00.322+03:00", "country": "US", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4nKbDUJCUNDTMkWX8nAeKS5LhguI867DrNm7TR6K9pasAct8X1_kVQSOBVYGZZei_mFGlpf5zOOW6XWVzPfM8NCqAcm44QhtF6AMBupI3Aw--", "performance_score": 6, "social": {"gplus": {"shares": 8}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 438}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 328}, "facebook": {"comments": 0, "likes": 698, "shares": 698}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}}, "domain_rank": 10416, "site_section": "", "site_full": "www.technologyreview.com", "site_type": "news", "main_image": "https://d267cvn3rvuq91.cloudfront.net/i/images/living-proof-7_0.jpg?cx=0&cy=296&cw=857&ch=482&sw=1200"}, "title": "The Science Behind Your Volumizing Shampoo - MIT Technology Review", "crawled": "2017-04-09T10:04:00.322+03:00", "author": "Elizabeth Woyke", "uuid": "2ac5d55539f10001893ae9d87914925609e34edf", "published": "2017-04-09T10:04:00.322+03:00", "external_links": [], "rating": null, "highlightText": "", "highlightTitle": "", "language": "english", "entities": {"organizations": [{"sentiment": "neutral", "name": "living proof"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "pbae"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "langer"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ofpma"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "merck"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "mit technology review"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "mit"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "etas"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "daniel anderson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ron mclaughlin"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "elizabeth woyke"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "robert langer"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "new york"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ofpma"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "massachusetts"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "new jersey"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cambridge"}]}, "ord_in_thread": 0, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZT4nKbDUJCUNDTMkWX8nAeKS5LhguI867DrNm7TR6K9pasAct8X1_kVQSOBVYGZZei_mFGlpf5zOOW6XWVzPfM8NCqAcm44QhtF6AMBupI3Aw--"}, {"text": "FIND OUT WHY \nAccording to Reuters , around three trillion dollars in daily commerce flow through COBOL systems. Many major financial corporations and some parts of the federal government have built their entire infrastructure on COBOL bases from the 70s and 80s. \nSo if something goes wrong, we might be looking at a major shitstorm. However, you could make money off preventing that. Retirees who can\u2019t stop working \nCompanies are in desperate need for some young blood with COBOL knowledge. Only a few universities are still teaching COBOL but it\u2019s not enough to meet demand . \nCurrently, banks and financial companies heavily rely on retirees , paying them $100 an hour to fix simple problems (for people with the right expertise). \n75-year-old Bill Hinshaw, founder of COBOL Cowboys , is one of the veterans who can\u2019t stop working. In an interview with Reuters he said that he often comes across software he wrote over 40 years ago, which shows how enduring the language is in today\u2019s financial systems. \nHowever, using retirees isn\u2019t exactly a sustainable solution because, let\u2019s face it, they\u2019re going to die at some point and there\u2019s no one to replace them. But the difficult thing about getting new people is that COBOL isn\u2019t as sexy as working with Elixir, or Golang. \nCOBOL work is often seen as boring maintenance duties which kills creativity. That isn\u2019t necessarily true as there\u2019s still new development and extending of COBOL applications being done, but the reputation persists. Why not switch from COBOL? \nSince there aren\u2019t many young programmers specializing in COBOL, the best thing would probably be to switch to a new coding language. But that isn\u2019t simple. \nIn 2012 the Commonwealth Bank of Australia replaced its core banking platform to modernize their system. The change ended up costing around 750 million dollars, which is why many banks have opted for trying to keep their COBOL systems going. \nThe great need for new COBOL programmers means great job-security and possibly higher salaries in the future, as the talent-pool gets smaller and smaller. \nSome predict it will remain a major language for the next 20 years , which is an amazing feat, given it was created at the very beginning of the computer age. So if you\u2019re a programmer who doesn\u2019t mind working in a slowly dying but fairly lucrative field, then COBOL might be just the thing for you.

HMD official explains how Android will help Nokia return to former glory Make Nokia Great Again! HMD official explains how Android will help Nokia return to former glory Posted: Tags : Nokia - Nokia + Android - Android + \nThe Nokia 6 in Arte Black Simplicity, ease of use, build quality. These were some of the main attributes that made Nokia phones so popular in the pre-iPhone era. Although the Finnish firm went through some very tough times in the past 10 years, its recent Android revival through HMD Global has undoubtedly delighted fans of the brand across the globe. As you may know, HMD Global secured the rights to produce and sell Nokia-branded handsets for the next 10 years, and according to one official from the company, a bright future lies ahead for the new Android-powered Nokia smartphones.Speaking to Gulf News, HMD Global\u2019s vice president for the Middle East and North Africa Per Ekman promised that the latest handsets will retain the same brand qualities which consumers loved in older Nokia products, while also giving details on how a new strategic partnership with Google will help propel the company back to its former glory: Most of the smartphones in the market do not have the Android OS in the way it should be. Vendors are adding a skin on top of the OS. Consumers have the right to have the latest version of the OS and we will be pushing the latest version and the patches as soon as it is available from Google ... We and Google will jointly enhance the Nokia brand to put the right kind of inputs into the phone, including Google Assistant HMD has been very keen on emphasizing that the Nokia 3 , Nokia 5 , and Nokia 6 will run the most clean, unaltered version of Android possible. This was officially announced back at MWC, where the company surprised everyone by stating that the three handsets will roll out with Android 7.1.1 out of the box, along with monthly security updates, and all of the latest software features from Google. This gives the trio a major advantage over its competitors, as the number of Android phones that run the latest version of the OS is extremely small (less than 1% of Android devices are on Nougat 7.1). According to Ekman, the results that HMD achieved with this year's January launch of the Nokia 6 in China are more than promising. Labeling the East Asian country as \"the toughest market\", he stated that more than one million units were sold in pre-registration within 23 seconds of the announcement. The handset will have a global launch alongside three other Nokia models, and although Ekman did not share any information about an exact release date, industry experts predict that the new phones will hit the shelves at the end of May or in early June.

One such incident took place in Dallas on Friday night when hacker triggered a network of 156 emergency warning sirens for about two hours, waking up residents and sparking fears of a disaster. The emergency warning sirens \u2014 designed to warn citizens of the Texas about dangerous weather conditions, such as severe storms and tornados \u2014 were activated around 11:40 p.m. Friday and lasted until 1:20 a.m. Saturday. The city officials tried to inform residents not to call 911 as there was not any emergency situation in the city, but the 911 system was nevertheless flooded with over 4,400 calls from panicked residents. Rocky Vaz, director of Dallas Office of Emergency Management (OEM), told the Dallas Morning News that the alarms blasted about 15 times for 90-second durations. You can even watch video footage of the incident posted by some people on the social media. Ever wonder what the end of the world feels like? #dallas #sirens pic.twitter.com/dvokKWkZ6N \u2014 ManicPixieDreamGay (@deadlyblonde) April 8, 2017 The OEM technicians were eventually able to shut down the warning system and are working to keep this from happening again by implementing \"more safeguards.\" The city officials said the sirens were set off by a hacker who compromised the Dallas city's emergency alert system, but they did not disclose how the system was compromised or who may be responsible for the attack. \"We can state at this time that the City\u2019s siren system was hacked Friday night,\" the Dallas Public Information Office confirmed on Saturday. \"For security reasons, we cannot discuss the details of how this was done, but we do believe that the hack came from the Dallas area.\" The officials have notified the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for assistance in identifying the exact source of the hack. This is the second time when some hacker has attacked critical infrastructure in the city. Last year, some unknown hacker hacked into some traffic signals in Dallas and used them to publish jokes. Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings noted on his Facebook page that the incident is yet \" another serious example of the need for us to upgrade and better safeguard our city\u2019s technology infrastructure ,\" adding that they\u2019re working on identifying and prosecuting those responsible for the attack.

The company will be launched within this month,\u201d the source said. As per the Section 8 of the Indian Companies Act, 2013, not-for-profit companies can be established for promotion of art, culture, science et al. \nAfter the launch, DIO will choose a knowledge partner for screening the ideas received for funding support. The selected ideas will be financially supported to work on the proof of concept and those will go through further down selection process to select concepts that can be funded for prototype development. \nThe successful prototypes will also be helped in their commercialisation. \u201cIf we get good response then the fund can go up to Rs 100 crore, with Rs 50 crore each from both the partners,\u201d source added. The process of the registration of the company is in final stages. \nAccording to sources, the company\u2019s board will initially have two nominated directors, one each from the HAL and BEL. The process of selection of the nominee directors is underway. The DIO, in future, may also have some independent directors.

Laptop makers are pushing the envelope on compact systems: Lenovo unveiled its Yoga 900S , a convertible notebook thinner than the 12-inch MacBook while keeping its USB 3.0 ports. Similarly, the HP EliteBook Folio G1 is also puts the MacBook to shame with its slimmer body despite incorporating a 4K touchscreen.\nHowever, before the MacBook and all its challengers, there was the Asus ZenBook UX305. This 13-inch Ultrabook comes with a stunningly svelte aluminum frame that is, again, thinner than the MacBook while packing a newly-added Skylake Core M processor and plenty of flash storage space. All of this might sound like the makings of an expensive compact laptop, the Asus ZenBook UX305 is actually one of the more affordable Windows 10 laptops, starting at $699 (\u00a3599, AU$1,199).\nThis makes the Asus ZenBook far more affordable than most premium Ultrabooks, like the glass-surfaced Acer Aspire S7 . And yet, this machine is just as carefully crafted as the all-metal Samsung Ativ Book 9 Spin . Asus has once again struck the perfect balance of affordability and luxury with its latest offering.\nLatest news While the Asus ZenBook UX305 is now well over a year old, there\u2019s a new Ultrabook in town and its name is ZenBook UX330. It\u2019s probably the closest you can get to the UX305 if you want a 7th-generation Intel processor equipped, and it runs at the same price the UX305 did at the time of its release.\nAt the same time, the classic Asus ZenBook UX305 flavor still goes strong. With the Windows 10 Creators Update on the horizon, slated for a release date of April 11 , it won\u2019t be long until we get a taste of new features such as Game Mode and Paint 3D. And that\u2019s without mentioning the fact that you\u2019ll be able to install the whole OS package using only your voice .\nJust bear in mind that, if you\u2019re a ZenBook user who is also a part of Microsoft\u2019s Insider Program, fast ring updates are about to get a little buggier from this point forward. Luckily, you can easily change back to the slow ring to avoid the headache.\n\n\nDesign You could easily mistake the Asus ZenBook UX305 for a sketchbook when holding it. It's stunningly thin, measuring just 0.5 inches thick and weighing 2.6 pounds (1.17 kg). This makes the ZenBook one of the skinniest Windows 10 machines in existence but don't think it's flimsy.\nThe UX305 is entirely made of aluminum. The interior deck is one solid piece of metal that features an anodized and fine grit finish. By no means is the surface abrasive \u2013 rather it adds an extra bit of texture for your wrists to sit on. The underside also sports an anodized sheen, and it's also made with a separate sheet of metal.\n\nFor a bit more style on the UX305's screen lid, Asus went with a brushed aluminum finish. However, instead of going with the traditional straight lines, the top panel features a radial pattern that's both attractive and conveniently draws your attention to the Asus logo in the center.\nDespite the small size of this Ultrabook, the trackpad is extremely roomy and extends over a third of the laptop's width. The trackpad almost looks comically large, but you'll appreciate the extra space and the frictionless surface. Better yet, clicks are tactile and audible whether you're pressing on the dedicated left and right buttons or pressing anywhere on the surface.\nSimilarly, the keyboard is spacious and follows the standard layout with a full-length backspace and enter key. The keys bottom out to a defined thump and spring back instantly for a responsive typing experience.\nAsus Zenbook UX305 (2015)-10\n\nImitation is the sincerest form of flattery There's no denying the Asus ZenBook UX305 looks exactly like a MacBook Air . From the hinge, the bezel around the screen, the position of the trackpad to the recessed keyboard, you can easily see the similarities to the MacBook Air . The hinge even helps to prop up the entire book at a tiny angle \u2013 just like Apple's ultralight notebook.\nOne of the few original touches Asus has added to the design are its chamfered edges, as opposed to the MacBook Air's razor sharp sides. Otherwise, the UX305 looks like the MacBook Air after it's gotten a nip-tuck job to make it marginally slimmer and lighter.\n\nWhile the new ZenBook seems extremely derivative, that isn't necessarily a bad thing. If the MacBook Air helped set the benchmark for Ultrabooks, then the UX305 has surpassed it and improved on the design.\nWhat's more, you also get a lot more ports too. This 13-inch laptop comes packing three USB 3.0 ports \u2013 which isn't even available on premium laptops, like the MacBook Pro and Surface Book .

Therefore, it performed extremely well during its pre-order period. The Note 7 set records for Samsung in South Korea, but according to industry sources, these have just been broken.If said sources are to be believed, a total of 550,000 units of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ have been pre-ordered in South Korea by Sunday. That's only two days after pre-orders initially opened. That's a massive 150,000 more than the Note7 before it, and whooping 5.5 times more than the Galaxy S7 .This is probably thanks to the high potential demand of the phone, as retail stores have received many pre-orders as well. Additionally, the country's three big carriers have launched massive marketing campaigns alongside Samsung, boosting pre-orders even further.What must be kept in mind here is that, although the Galaxy S8 performs pretty well in South Korea, that doesn't guarantee the same reception in Western markets.

Peter Yuryevich Levashov, 32-years-old Russian computer programmer, suspected of operating the Kelihos botnet \u2014 a global network of over 100,000 infected computers that was used to deliver spam, steal login passwords, and infect computers with ransomware and other types of malware since approximately 2010, the U.S. Justice Department announced Monday. As suspected earlier, Levashov, also known as Peter Severa, is the same   World's   The arrest was made possible after the FBI learned just last month that Levashov was traveling with his family to Spain from his home in Russia, a country without any extradition treaty to the United States. Initially, it was believed that Levashov was detained on suspicion of 2016 US election hack , after his wife told Russian publication RT that authorities said her husband\u2019s apprehension was in part due to his involvement in the U.S. election hacking, including the notorious breach of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). However, the DoJ press release indicates no link between Levashov and US election hack at all. Instead, Levashov was linked to the Kelihos botnet by the FBI because he used the same IP address to operate the botnet that he used to access his email and other online accounts in his name, including Apple iCloud and Google Gmail accounts. According to the indictment unsealed Monday, Levashov operated the botnet since 2010, targeting Microsoft Windows machines for infection. He allegedly used Kelihos to distribute   per year, and pump-and-dump stock scams. Besides conducting spamming operations, prosecutors also alleged Levashov also used the Kelihos botnet to infect end-user computers with malware and harvest passwords to online and bank accounts belonging to thousands of Americans. \"The ability of botnets like Kelihos to be weaponized quickly for vast and varied types of harms is a dangerous and deep threat to all Americans, driving at the core of how we communicate, network, earn a living, and live our everyday lives,\" said Acting Assistant Attorney General Blanco. \"Our success in disrupting the Kelihos botnet was the result of strong cooperation between private industry experts and law enforcement, and the use of innovative legal and technical tactics.\" The FBI officials obtained court orders (Rule 41 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure) to redirect Kelihos-infected PCs to servers operated by authorities \u2014 a process known as \" Sinkhole attack \" \u2014 and to block any attempts by the botnet to regain control of those sinkholed computers. The FBI said it worked with security firm CrowdStrike and Shadowserver Foundation, a volunteer group of information security experts, to deploy the sinkhole attack to disconnect communications between criminals and infected computers. Levashov has been charged with wire fraud and unauthorized interception of electronic communications. The government is now seeking his extradition to the United States.

Think $300 less, or more! We are talking about OnePlus and the upcoming OnePlus 5. Skipping a number to prevent the bad fortune the Chinese associate with 4, the handset is rumored to be spec'd to the nines and comparatively design-conscious. Here are 5 things about the OnePlus 5 that give it true \"flagship killer\" potential \u2013 at least figuratively. For its unbeatable performance-to-ratio advantage in Western markets, let's remember that OnePlus can't pull off Samsung's billion dollar marketing to get comparable sales volume, doesn't partner with carriers, and is going to remain an \"underdog\" for the foreseeable future.But these are technicalities. Let us focus on the great potential at hand \u2013 even if it's all rumors at this point! 1. A new design with slim bezels and no Home button, ready to tackle Samsung's You may have thought OnePlus needs to freshen it up for the follow-up to the rather basic-looking OP 2 and OP 3. Apparently, so does the company! Leaks from China suggest very thin side bezels, or possibly an \"all-screen\" type design as a major change coming to the OnePlus 5. What's more, OP is supposedly doing away with the physical home button, too, and moving the fingerprint scanner to the back panel \u2013 hopefully in a more sensible place than Samsung's camera-smudging placement. 1. OnePlus 5 design concept 2. OnePlus 5 design concept 3. OnePlus 5 design concept While we doubt OnePlus has the resources to make a phone quite as sleek and meticulous as the Galaxy S8 right now, it can certainly generate a looker that's on par with the Xiaomi Mi Mix or another eye-grabbing model. Which would be a huge advantage, combined with other strong sides the OP5 is rumored to have! Such as... 2. More RAM memory than any other smartphone in 2017 Look, we all know RAM isn't the be-all, end-all of smartphone performance. But the OnePlus 5 is rumored to feature a whopping 8GB of the stuff, and OP knows darn well how to sell the extra memory put in its handsets. The OnePlus 3 is still a big deal for having 6GB RAM anywhere in the world. The few 6GB handsets today are China-exclusives.Additional RAM might not give them any considerable speed advantages, but it sure makes a smartphone appear more powerful and cutting-edge! And with 8GB of RAM, the OnePlus will easily make the Galaxy S8 , which hovers between 4GB and 6GB in different markets, seem a tad underpowered.Said excess of RAM is expected to be packaged with the Snapdragon 835 processor and a 2K-resolution display (a first for OnePlus), evening out the playing field between the \"flagship\" and its killer-candidate in these regards. 3. A supercharged camera with possible dual-lens setup OnePlus may be bulletproofing the OP5's spec sheet to the largest extent possible at the time of launch. This includes rumors of a 23MP rear camera and 16MP front camera. Chances are the rear cam will be a dual-lens module with optical image stabilization, but alas, we haven't been clued in to any other goodies that may be in store.Single or dual-lens, a 23MP camera is almost twice as generous as what Samsung offers with the Galaxy S8's 12MP camera in terms of raw megapixel count. But it's perfectly possible that the S8 will end up beating the OnePlus 5 \u2013 and probably most new Android phones \u2013 in terms of photo quality. \nOnePlus 5 design concept OnePlus may have the bigger sensor, but as a smaller company, it may not have what it takes to make the absolute most out of it. With that said, OP always shipped decent cameras, and we expect adequate shots from the upcoming OnePlus 5. 4. Better battery life than most Rumored to stand at between 3500mAh to 4000mAh, the OnePlus 5's large battery capacity and its power-efficient Snapdragon 835 chipset will probably make for excellent battery life, surpassing that of the Galaxy S8 and, possibly, the Galaxy S8+'. They ship with 3000mAh and 3500mAh units, respectively, and are rated around the same as their predecessors, the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge . The line is clear for OnePlus to come up with one of the longest-lasting Android smartphones this year... if it really wants to. 5. A price that's hard to resist! The price is going to be the biggest kicker. Word is, OnePlus is going to sell all the aforementioned goodness for less than $500! This is very affordable for a handset this up-to-date, easily up to $300-$350 less than what any competitor on the Western market has to offer.Unfortunately, OnePlus doesn't have the advantage of working with carriers anywhere in Europe or the US, and warranty or customer support may be spotty, depending on where you purchase from. Moreover, OnePlus has trouble keeping its aging models up to date \u2013 the OP2 and OnePlus X are yet to receive Nougat updates, and no one at the company's up to explain why. Well, we know why \u2013 it's a small company doing small company things! \nOnePlus 5 design concept There's still very little to lose from purchasing a handset like the OP5 unlocked, so unless it ships with some deadly flaws, the new OnePlus could be the phone to beat in price-to-performance ratio this year. OP's product quality and sales get better with each year , so we are generally optimistic about its latest effort.

We've been hearing rumors of its newest flagship, the Mi 6, for quite some time now, but a recent string of posts on Xiaomi's official page on Chinese social networking site Weibo suggests the device will be unveiled tomorrow, April 11. Starting April 6, Xiaomi has been publishing daily posts dedicated to each of its Mi flagships on its Weibo page, and today it has posted the last of them, the one for the Mi 5. While this isn't an outright confirmation that the Mi 6 will be announced tomorrow, the timing is weirdly coincidental with a press conference that will be held tomorrow. Moreover, Xiaomi has apparently sent a WeChat message to its fans saying they should expect something tomorrow at noon, further confirming there is a big reveal coming up. \nA purported photo of the Mi 6's back panel, showing off its dual camera While it may not be as leaky as the Samsung Galaxy S8 , we still know quite a lot about the Mi 6. Its processor will most likely be Qualcomm's Snapdragon 835, though we have also heard rumors of a 821 version as well. The rear camera of the device is said to be a 12 MP dual-camera module with Sony's IMX 386 sensor, while the front will be a regular 8 MP shooter with IMX 268. There will also apparently be two options memory-wise: a 4GB RAM + 64GB internal memory one and another with a 6 GB + 128 GB combo. The screen is said to sport a 5.2-inch panel, though there's also apparently two versions of that as well: one will have a Quad HD resolution, while the other will top at Full HD instead. It's not entirely clear whether there will be just two versions of the device, or if Xiaomi will be playing mix-and-match with the specs, but we surely won't have to wait for long to see. The phone is said to also run Android 7.1.1 and will reportedly be IP68-certified. The press conference is set for noon Hong Kong time on April 11, which translates to midnight Eastern Time. We'll make sure to keep you updated if the Mi 6 really does get unveiled tomorrow, though we're almost certain it will.
