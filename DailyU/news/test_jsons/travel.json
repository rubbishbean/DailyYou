Her husband, Tyler Bridges, said United offered $400 (about R5 550) and then $800 (about R11 110) vouchers and a hotel stay for volunteers to give up their seats. \nWhen no one volunteered, a United manager came on the plane and announced that passengers would be chosen at random. \n\"We almost felt like we were being taken hostage,\" Tyler Bridges said. \"We were stuck there. You can't do anything as a traveller. You're relying on the airline.\" \nALSO SEE: #NewUnitedAirlinesMottos: United taken to task for latest passenger debacle \nThis is what the incident looked like - \nOscar Munoz, CEO of United Airlines' parent company, apologized first in a written statement and then in a letter to employees Monday evening. \nMunoz said he was \"upset to see and hear about what happened\" at O'Hare. He added, however, that the man dragged off the plane had ignored requests by crew members to leave and became \"disruptive and belligerent,\" making it necessary to call airport police. \n\"Our employees followed established procedures for dealing with situations like this,\" Munoz told employees. \"While I deeply regret this situation arose, I also emphatically stand behind all of you, and I want to commend you for continuing to go above and beyond to ensure we fly right.\" \nMunoz said that the airline might learn from the experience, and it was continuing to look into the incident. \nThe flight was operated for United by Republic Airline, which United hires to fly United Express flights. Munoz said four Republic employees approached United's gate agents after the plane was fully loaded and said they needed to board. He said the airline asked for volunteers to give up their seats, and then moved to involuntary bumping, offering up to $1 000 (about R13 880) in compensation. \nDoctor who needed to see patients \nThe passenger who refused to leave told the manager that he was a doctor who needed to see patients in the morning, Tyler Bridges said. \n\"He was kind of saying that he was being singled out because he's a Chinese man\" when speaking to the manager, who was African-American, Bridges said. \n\"You should know what this is like,\" the man said, according to Bridges. \nThe AP was unable to confirm the passenger's identity. \nTwo officers tried to reason with the man before a third came aboard and pointed at the man \"basically saying, 'Sir, you have to get off the plane,'\" Bridges said. That's when the altercation happened. \nOne officer involved has been placed on leave, the Chicago Aviation Department said. \nAfter the passenger was removed, the four airline employees boarded the plane. \n\"People on the plane were letting them have it,\" Bridges said. \"They were saying, 'You should be ashamed to work for this company.'\" \nA few minutes after the employees boarded, the man who was removed returned, looking dazed and saying he had to get home, Bridges said. \nIn a video, the man can be seen standing in the aisle near what appears to be the rear of the aircraft. Blood is on his mouth, chin and cheek as he said, \"I want to go home.\" \nOfficers followed him to the back of the plane. Another man travelling with high school students stood up at that point and said they were getting off the plane, Bridges said. \nAbout half of the passengers followed before United told everyone to get off, he said. \nThe man who was originally dragged down the aisle was removed from the plane again, and United employees made an announcement saying they had to \"tidy up\" the aircraft, Bridges said. \nBridges' wife told him she saw the man taken away on a stretcher, he said. \nAfter a three-hour delay the flight took off without the man aboard, Bridges said. A United employee apologized to passengers, he said. \nOverbooking flights \nAirlines are allowed to sell more tickets than there are seats on the plane, and they routinely overbook flights because some people do not show up. \nIt's not unusual for airlines to offer travel vouchers to encourage people to give up their seats, and there are no rules for the process. When an airline demands that a passenger give up a seat, the airline is required to pay compensation of double the passenger's one-way fare, up to $675 (about R9 300), if the passenger can be placed on another flight that arrives one to two hours later than the first flight, or four times the ticket price, up to $1 350 (about R18 750), for longer delays. \nWhen they bump passengers, airlines are required to give those passengers a written description of their compensation rights. \nUnited spokesman Charles Hobart declined to say how the airline compensated the passengers who were forced to leave the plane, saying he did not have those details from employees on the scene. \nBridges said United should not have boarded the flight if it was overbooked. \n\"The man handled it wrong,\" he said. \"The police were kind of put in a bad spot. There's a lot of ways United could have handled it, and that was not one of the good ways.\" \nWhat to read next on Traveller24 :", "highlightText": "", "external_links": [], "language": "english", "thread": {"site_section": "http://www.news24.com/news24RSSFeed/1,,2,00.xml", "site_categories": ["travel", "education"], "site_type": "news", "participants_count": 0, "published": "2017-04-11T11:06:19.189+03:00", "spam_score": 0.0, "social": {"pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 803, "shares": 803, "comments": 0}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}}, "title": "News24.com | WATCH: Outrage after United Airlines drags doctor off overbooked flight", "performance_score": 8, "uuid": "34ee7c484108a3df58f3580da5f3e2d58828a492", "replies_count": 0, "main_image": "http://cdn.24.co.za/files/Cms/General/d/1834/2e27656a632d4a7b9217e3206114ab89.png", "section_title": "News24 Top Stories", "country": "ZA", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrCj4Zy4VHvzxU7U9xSxHMNhjgWfevG6_AC.A3EioGGobgMhL9XHqD84mymAwmpSU5BxXXIq_c3L8s6lstXb8poh9tByv9CY6A0jI5iP7ojYiZgqkb7eZ_7hhcb3hZwh4c70kdavn3llIwcH1gUrGoiSKhNe7J8naU-", "domain_rank": 2153, "site": "news24.com", "site_full": "traveller24.news24.com", "title_full": "News24.com | WATCH: Outrage after United Airlines drags doctor off overbooked flight"}, "title": "News24.com | WATCH: Outrage after United Airlines drags doctor off overbooked flight", "ord_in_thread": 0, "rating": null, "published": "2017-04-11T11:06:19.189+03:00", "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/DyQaNGXlfMrCj4Zy4VHvzxU7U9xSxHMNhjgWfevG6_AC.A3EioGGobgMhL9XHqD84mymAwmpSU5BxXXIq_c3L8s6lstXb8poh9tByv9CY6A0jI5iP7ojYiZgqkb7eZ_7hhcb3hZwh4c70kdavn3llIwcH1gUrGoiSKhNe7J8naU-", "entities": {"organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "united airlines"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "chicago aviation department"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "united by republic airline"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "facebook"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ap"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "united express"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "united"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "oscar munoz"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "charles hobart"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "munoz"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "tyler bridges"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "united ai"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "chicago"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "republic"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "o'hare airport"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "louisville"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kentucky"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "o'hare"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-11T11:06:19.189+03:00", "highlightTitle": "", "uuid": "34ee7c484108a3df58f3580da5f3e2d58828a492", "author": ""}, {"text": "Crazy Video: Passenger Forcibly Dragged Off United Flight April 10, 2017 by lucky 27 Comments \nSome crazy video footage has emerged from Twitter users @JayseDavid and @Tyler_Bridges , of a passenger forcibly being dragged off a plane. The incident occurred yesterday on United 3411 from Chicago to Louisville, which ended up being delayed by about two hours. \nThe incident allegedly occurred because the flight was overbooked, and United needed to get a crew to Louisville. As a result, they needed to bump revenue passengers to let on crew members. That\u2019s not uncommon \u2014 when there are irregular operations airlines often need to reposition their crews, and understandably that\u2019s a priority. Not having a crew could cause another flight to get canceled, and that could have a domino effort. \nThe Twitter user explains that the guy was telling police that he had to go to the hospital in the morning to see patients (I\u2019m not sure if he was a doctor, nurse, or what), and seemingly refused to voluntarily get off the plane. As a result, the police were called, and then the following happened (here are two videos of it from different angles): @united @FoxNews @CNN not a good way to treat a Doctor trying to get to work because they overbooked pic.twitter.com/sj9oHk94Ik \n\u2014 Tyler Bridges (@Tyler_Bridges) April 9, 2017 @United overbook #flight3411 and decided to force random passengers off the plane. Here's how they did it: pic.twitter.com/QfefM8X2cW \n\u2014 Jayse D. Anspach (@JayseDavid) April 10, 2017 \nDespite being dragged off the plane, the guy somehow managed to still run back on the plane and yell \u201cI need to get home.\u201d @united @CNN @FoxNews @WHAS11 Man forcibly removed from plane somehow gets back on still bloody from being removed pic.twitter.com/njS3nC0pDl \n\u2014 Tyler Bridges (@Tyler_Bridges) April 10, 2017 \nIt seems like the guy\u2019s lip got busted on the way out, as he started bleeding from his mouth. Ouch. \nSadly this isn\u2019t the first time an incident like this has happened. Just a few months ago, a woman was dragged off a Delta flight : \nWhat do I make of this? Well, it\u2019s sad that this is the second time in a few months that someone was dragged off a plane. It\u2019s even sadder than I wasn\u2019t fazed when I saw this video, which is perhaps a reflection of the type of force we\u2019re used to seeing police use in the US. \nObviously there would ideally be another solution, but at the same time the guy sort of did this to himself. FAA regulations require you to comply with crewmember instructions, and that includes when they tell you to get off the plane. If you refuse to do so and just remain seated, the airlines only have so many options. \nSo while I hate seeing stuff like this, it was entirely avoidable if the guy had listened. I know air travel can be frustrating, but ignoring crewmember instructions will never end well for you, at least in the US. \nIn other industries, being persistent and refusing to do something might get you your way. That\u2019s not the case on a plane. I guess this guy learned that lesson the hard way. I do hope that the airline solicited volunteers to get off the plane before choosing who to involuntarily remove from the flight. And I hope they raised the offer significantly and made a real effort to solicit volunteers. I also hope that the police warned him that he would be dragged off the flight if he didn\u2019t get off voluntarily.

O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Diner in Middletown, CT A post shared by O'Rourke's Diner (@orourkesdiner) on Jul 30, 2015 at 6:48pm PDT \nSeeing as how they\u2019re hungover approximately 90 percent of the time, college students are always in need of a good diner, which makes attendees of Middletown\u2019s Wesleyan University a lucky lot: O\u2019Rourke\u2019s is one of the best in the northeast. Established in 1941, the local favorite was decimated by a fire in 2006, but quickly reopened the following year after an outpouring of support from the local community. Chef/owner Brian O\u2019Rourke turns out kooky, heavily Irish-influenced plates that change daily; look for over-the-top creations like the Belly Buster, a six-egg omelette stuffed with three types of cheese, bacon, sausage and veggies; and a divine Irish soda bread French toast, slathered with homemade jam and rich clotted cream. A post shared by Dime Store (@eatdimestore) on Jan 21, 2015 at 1:57pm PST \nThis wildly creative brunch restaurant just qualifies as a diner, but the strength of its kitchen staff belies the usual expectations of plain old burgers and fries. Instead, look for original takes on diner fare, like a Belgian waffle made churro-style with malted batter and sprinkled with cinnamon sugar; a Korean-style \u201cduck bop\u201d hash made with house-confited duck leg and pickled veggies; and poutine-style fries piled with bacon and parmesan and drizzled with white truffle oil. Don\u2019t miss the sweet and strong Irish coffee, spiked with plenty of whiskey. A post shared by Smitty T-bird (@smittytbird) on Jul 8, 2015 at 11:19am PDT \nIn the mid-1800s, Polish immigrants flocked to Pittsburgh to work in the city\u2019s exploding steel industry and, while their numbers in the \u2018Burgh have since dwindled, they\u2019ve still left their mark on the city with a handful of little Eastern European shops, cafes and lunch counters. Our favorite is S&D, a grocery store located in a strip mall boasting a full-service deli counter plating fresh, hot stuffed cabbage, borscht and more. We love the plump pierogies, stuffed with fluffy mashed potatoes and cheddar cheese, farmer cheese, sauerkraut or mushrooms. Hangover tip: get \u2018em fried. A post shared by Swingers Diner (@swingersdiner) on Mar 15, 2017 at 6:42pm PDT \nThis Santa Monica diner is a mutt of retro design and throwback flair, a place where oversized paper lanterns and tiled walls manage to mix with plaid plastic upholsteries and purple cow graphics. The prices on Swingers\u2019 menu can make you feel like you\u2019re getting away with something\u2014it\u2019s that much of a steal. The food here doesn\u2019t skimp on quality, though. A shortstack of pancakes produces one of the fluffiest, most perfectly golden breakfast plates, made an even bigger accomplishment by the fact that they\u2019re plain and not doused in whipped cream or slivers of fruit. The French toast is a dream, too, so it\u2019s clear that Swingers has its breakfast carbs down pat. Also a plus: the counter is a friendly spot if you\u2019re dining alone.

A dish that ably solves the brunchtime paradox of sweet vs. savory, it includes Cadillac\u2019s juicy homemade chicken-apple sausage, a custardy slice of hazelnut French toast and a pile of toasty hash browns. Of the top-notch burgers, the standout is the original Cadillac, a moist patty piled with bacon, three cheeses and sweet onion jam and served on grilled sourdough bread. A post shared by Cristina (@ladymadonna) on Oct 11, 2015 at 6:51am PDT \nThis Union Square diner bordering the Tenderloin feeds all walks of life, 24 hours a day, from hungry tourists to throngs of partiers after they leave the nearby club Ruby Skye, which lets out at 4am on the weekend. All-day breakfast, with decent hash browns, is the popular pick, but don\u2019t ask for any poached or boiled eggs\u2014they don\u2019t serve any. Blame the diner\u2019s illustrious and dark history: in 1997, a cook shot and killed a waitress after an argument over an order of poached eggs. (Maybe go for one of their Niman Ranch beef burgers instead.) 9. Metro Diner in Raleigh, NC A post shared by Triangle Explorer (@triangleexplorer) on Jan 14, 2017 at 10:03am PST \nThis Raleigh favorite doesn\u2019t hold back when it comes to over-the-top comfort food: a selection of groaning platters includes crab cakes egg Benedict, French toast made with pound cake and a French dip sandwich piled high with tender roast beef. The Charleston-style shrimp and grits are a must-order: two cheesy fried grits cakes piled with jumbo shrimp, thick slices of andouille sausage, creamy gravy and a sprinkling of chopped bacon for good measure. A post shared by misato hanafusa (@misato_rhythm) on Apr 9, 2017 at 11:01pm PDT \nAt this 1958 diner, all things faceted are in fashion: pyramidal lamps, a diamond-shaped clock and an irregular roofline. The care that\u2019s gone into keeping this family-run restaurant in tip top shape is evident in everything from its ruby red booths and white bar stools to its perfectly preserved neon sign. When it comes to Pann\u2019s menu, there\u2019s one item that stands out above all else: the fried chicken. Take a single bite and you\u2019ll have juice dripping down your chin; two and you\u2019ll be marveling at how crispy and well-seasoned the skin is. Look around, though, and you\u2019ll see others ordering burgers, grits, chili and omelettes. Whatever you choose, make sure it comes with a side of fries, golden with a dusting of Cajun spice. A list of specialty shakes appeals to the sweet tooth in all of us. We\u2019re partial to the chocolate banana\u2014creamy, rich and enough for two people to split. 11.

The adorable blue-and-white railcar-style diner was assembled in New Jersey and shipped to town in 1948, and its hot open-faced sandwiches, fryer treats and homey desserts have been favorites ever since. Its roast beef sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy is a must-order, as is a comforting dessert of pumpkin bread pudding.

Either way, it\u2019s one of the oldest restaurants in the city. But there\u2019s no time for this homey diner to dwell on the past\u2014the space bustles with a mix of Woodlawn locals and U. of C. students, especially in the mornings, when they gather for the ethereal Belgian waffles (offered with a side of juicy chicken wings), hearty Denver omelettes and warm, buttery biscuits.

Of the served-all-day breakfast, the corned beef hash is the obvious star\u2014crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside, it\u2019s served up on a monster platter alongside two eggs, home fries and toast for just $8.95. Also look for anything made with linguica, the Portuguese sausage popularized by Massachusetts\u2019 large expat population\u2014we\u2019re partial to the fluffy linguica omelette with cheese. 14. The Echo in Cincinnati, OH A post shared by Michael Howard (@howardmjay) on Mar 15, 2016 at 5:21am PDT Open since 1945, this Cincinnati staple has been a favorite of factory workers and brunchers alike for more than six decades.

The style of these diners is inspired by the 1950s, with a classic look that will have you humming along to Chubby Checker while seated in your shiny cherry red booth and surrounded by memorabilia, like an Edsel (no joke).

Texas-style dishes are the way to go here: think fried catfish and grits, fluffy Ranchero omelettes and chicken-fried steak smothered in cream gravy.

This is sort of unbelievable. \nIf there\u2019s one thing United should have learned from their leggings incident a couple of weeks ago , it\u2019s how important having a quick and coherent response from upper management is. That situation could have been largely diffused if they corrected themselves on Twitter quickly, and also issued a high-level explanation and apology within a short period of time. \nNow, just a couple of weeks later, United once again finds themselves in the midst of a viral news story, as a customer is dragged off a plane by police while bleeding , because he didn\u2019t want to give up his confirmed seat. This time around United responded to the incident more quickly, all the way from the top. \nOscar Munoz is United\u2019s fairly new CEO , and he\u2019s a really well liked guy. He seems to want to change the corporate culture of the company, and he\u2019s loved by employees, customers, and shareholders. It\u2019s rare that\u2019s the case at an airline. As a result, his responses (or at least the responses that have his name attached to them) leave me terribly disappointed. \nEarlier today the following statement was released, signed by Oscar Munoz (bolding mine): \n\u201cThis is an upsetting event to all of us here at United. I apologize for having to re-accommodate these customers . Our team is moving with a sense of urgency to work with the authorities and conduct our own detailed review of what happened. We are also reaching out to this passenger to talk directly to him and further address and resolve this situation.\u201d \u2013 Oscar Munoz, CEO, United Airlines \nLook, I understand from a legal standpoint they probably don\u2019t want to apologize that they called the cops on a customer, rather than working harder to diffuse the situation. But to apologize for having to \u201cre-accommodate a customer\u201d is horribly insulting. Just pathetic. C\u2019mon Oscar, aren\u2019t you ashamed to say that after watching a video like this? \n\u2014 Kaylyn Davis (@kaylyn_davis) April 10, 2017 \nUnfortunately it gets much worse. This evening United sent out a letter to employees explaining the situation, which reads as follows, per @jonostrower : \nDear Team, \nLike you, I was upset to see and hear about what happened last night aboard United Express Flight 3411 headed from Chicago to Louisville. While the facts and circumstances are still evolving, especially with respect to why this customer defied Chicago Aviation Security Officers the way he did, to give you a clear picture of what transpired, I\u2019ve included below a recap from the preliminary reports filed by our employees. \nAs you will read, the situation was unfortunately compounded when one of the passengers we politely asked to deplane refused and it became necessary to contact Chicago Aviation Security Officers to help. Our employees followed stablished procedures for dealing with situations like this. While I deeply regret this situation arose, I also emphatically stand behind all of you, and I want to commend you for continuing to go and above and beyond to ensure we fly right. \nI do, however, believe there are lessons we can learn from this experience, and we are taking a closer look at the circumstances surrounding this incident. Treating our customers and each other with respect and dignity is at the core of who we are, and we must always remember this no matter how challenging the situation. \nOscar On Sunday, April 9, after United Express Flight 3411 was fully boarded, United\u2019s gate agent were approached by crewmembers that were told they needed to board the flight We sought volunteers and then followed our involuntary denial of boarding process (including offering up to $1,000 in compensation) and when we approached one of these passengers to explain apologetically that he was being denied boarding, he raised his voice and refused to comply with crewmember instructions. He was approached a few more times after that in order to gain his compliance to come off the aircraft, and each time he refused and became more and more disruptive and belligerent. Our agents were left with no choice but to call Chicago Aviation Security Officers to assist in removing the customer from the flight. He repeatedly declined to leave. Chicago Aviation Security Officers were unable to gain his cooperation and physically removed him from the flight as he continued to resist \u2013 running back onto the aircraft in defiance of both our crew and security officials \nFirst of all let me say that all the reports I\u2019ve seen from other passengers suggest that the passenger in question wasn\u2019t aggressive or belligerent. He was frustrated, but that was it. \nSecond of all, what a horrible, horrible , horrible response that only makes this situation worst. How incompetent is the team running United? I really don\u2019t get it. I\u2019d be disappointed if this came from a typical disliked CEO, but from Oscar Munoz it\u2019s even more disappointing. \nSurely they know a letter sent to employees would also be made public, so do they really think this is the right response after their second major snafu in just a couple of weeks? Here are a few of the most ridiculous quotes: \u201cWhile the facts and circumstances are still evolving, especially with respect to why this customer defied Chicago Aviation Security Officers the way he did.\u201d REALLY?! Those are the facts and circumstances that are most significant in this case, rather than how you couldn\u2019t get your gate agents to solicit volunteers, and that they had to call the police to have this passenger removed? That says a lot about the focus of United\u2019s \u201cinvestigation.\u201d \u201cWhile I deeply regret this situation arose, I also emphatically stand behind all of you, and I want to commend you for continuing to go and above and beyond to ensure we fly right.\u201d I get he doesn\u2019t want to put down employees, but is this really the time to thank employees for going above and beyond? While they\u2019re calling cops on customers because they\u2019re either not significantly empowered or too lazy to work harder to find volunteers? \u201cTreating our customers and each other with respect and dignity is at the core of who we are.\u201d Well, Oscar, it seems you could learn that lesson as well, because when a passenger on your airline is ripped off a plane by police bleeding because you couldn\u2019t accommodate his confirmed reservation, and when the best you can apologize for is that he was re-accommodated, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re living up to the \u201ccore\u201d of who you are. \u201cOur agents were left with no choice but to call Chicago Aviation Security Officers to assist in removing the customer from the flight.\u201d They were left with no choice, really? Then what\u2019s the point of the investigation, even? It seems this was United at its best, apparently. \nThis is just beyond pathetic on so many levels. I\u2019ve had a lot of respect for Oscar Munoz. Clearly United made an effort to have communication from the top this time around (unlike last time), but as it turns out, that makes the situation even worse. \nThis is just appalling. He could at least acknowledge that they should look into their procedures surrounding denied boarding, how they interact with customers, and if the situation could have been avoided. \nSpeaking of Oscar Munoz, he was recently awarded PR Week\u2019s \u201cCommunicator Of The Year\u201d award .
