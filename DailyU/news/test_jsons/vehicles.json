This is the perfect SUV for someone who wants everything\u2013luxury, off-road capability, and crazy performance. 2 Of 10 Range Rover Sport SVR \u2013 550 Horsepower \nThe Range Rover Sport SVR uses the same engine and gearbox as the Range Rover SVAutobiography Dynamic, but it puts it in a lighter, more sporty chassis. Heck, Land Rover even took it to the Nurburgring for development . It's totally unnecessary, and utterly great.   3 Of 10 Mercedes-AMG G63 \u2013 563 Horsepower \nThere are few vehicles on sale today equally as pointless and as great as the Mercedes-AMG G63. The last thing this ancient off-roader needs is a 5.5-liter twin-turbo V8 with 563 horsepower, and yet, it's hard to think of a better engine for it. It's shockingly quick, and hilariously rude. It's not the most powerful G-Wagen though. 4 Of 10 BMW X5 M and X6 M \u2013 567 Horsepower \nUsing a similar 4.4-liter twin-turbo V8 to the outgoing M5, BMW's X5 M and X6 M produce a 567 horsepower. These things are huge but thanks to that engine combined with a dual-clutch transmission, and a great chassis, they're genuine monsters on track .   5 Of 10 Porsche Cayenne Turbo S \u2013 570 Horsepower \nNext year, Porsche will debut the 680-hp Cayenne Turbo S E-Hybrid , but until then, we'll have to settle for the 570-hp Cayenne Turbo S. That may sound like a travesty, but the Cayenne Turbo S is still capable of a 3.8-second 0-60 mph run, and a 176-mph top speed. 6 Of 10 Mercedes-AMG GLE63 S \u2013 577 Horsepower \nUsing the same engine as the AMG G63, Mercedes' GLE63 makes 577 horsepower in \"S\" trim and 550 horsepower in regular specifications. Like all Mercedes-AMG products featuring this engine, it's a brute.   7 Of 10 Mercedes-AMG GLS63 \u2013 577 Horsepower \nWhen AMG develops an engine, it fits in in damn near every car and truck Mercedes-Benz offers. The GLS63 gets the same engine as the GLE63 S, which is totally absurd in a giant three-row SUV like this. God bless the loons at AMG. 8 Of 10 Bentley Bentayga \u2013 600 Horsepower \nThanks in part to a 600-hp 6.0-liter W12, Bentley claims the World's Fastest SUV title with its ultra-luxury Bentayga. Flat out, it'll hit a fairly ridiculous 187 mph. Of course, it's not the world's most powerful SUV.   9 Of 10 Mercedes-AMG G65 - 621 Horsepower \nWe're not sure why the 621-hp V12-powered Mercedes-AMG G65 exists, but we're so glad it does. It's way too powerful for its own good, and we wouldn't have it any other way. 10 Of 10 Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk \u2013 707 Horsepower \nIt was only a matter of time before Dodge's 707-hp Supercharged Hellcat motor ended up somewhere else in the Fiat Chrysler family. No, the Grand Cherokee doesn't need 707 horsepower, but is it better for it? Almost assuredly. The Trackhawk is the World's Most Powerful SUV, and although pricing hasn't been announced yet, it's probably the cheapest thing on this list.", "rating": null, "author": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "thread": {"site_full": "www.roadandtrack.com", "site_categories": [], "country": "US", "site": "roadandtrack.com", "spam_score": 0.0, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg_T0cO7oNRL5B26oKFSOofOJE7eq7OdV__poYCa4ofr7CMTF4A_0vK_ngiDgoVGQq76v6QdT5KIQA--", "title_full": "The 10 Most Powerful SUVs On Sale Today", "replies_count": 0, "social": {"facebook": {"shares": 912, "comments": 0, "likes": 912}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}}, "performance_score": 9, "main_image": "http://pop.h-cdn.co/assets/17/15/1600x800/1492093735-1491924607-jp018-043gc7eo5qitoh7aamo73vsr6pe3ss.jpg", "uuid": "abf726f6f05c4f79962f303fd28d382022603ad5", "domain_rank": 7232, "site_type": "news", "published": "2017-04-15T22:07:16.000+03:00", "section_title": "Latest Content - Popular Mechanics", "title": "The 10 Most Powerful SUVs On Sale Today", "participants_count": 0, "site_section": "http://www.popularmechanics.com/rss"}}, {"highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-16T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-04-16T20:11:09.000+03:00", "ord_in_thread": 0, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8.X2SkyW09ozJ5h7MD_3K0hWjEK4I1xj5EO0lxJMJLfhTwhNHxGPDOATLmXuAvcss-", "title": "Mazda MX-5 Miata", "highlightText": "", "uuid": "ecb9f042845b86ea8bbd26c5afa468897df78903", "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "miata bengt halvorson", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "bose", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "mazda mx-5 miata", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mazda", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "mx-5 miata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "gm", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "fiat", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mercedes-benz", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "lotus elan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mx-5 miata club", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "mercedes", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "pontiac solstice", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miata", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "porsche boxster", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bmw", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "japan", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "miata", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "text": "Bengt Halvorson Deputy Editor \nThe Mazda MX-5 Miata has kept alive the dream of pure two-seat sports cars for 25 years. While it's rekindled a love of classic roadsters, it's also converted a new generation to the joys of top-down driving in a simple, nimble, back-to-basics two-seater without excessive power. \nThe Miata is a true sports car, and perhaps one of the more unlikely successes of the modern automotive era. Designed in the 1980s as an homage to the classic British roadster, the Miata offered up all the driving fun of those sports cars, but virtually none of the ownership pains. That combination continues today. \nThe Miata's success inspired other automakers to build classic sports cars. The BMW Z3, Porsche Boxster, and Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class arrived over the next decade. Those German models, though they started out as more stripped-down machines, quickly went upmarket, with the BMW and Mercedes trading in 4-cylinder engines for 6 cylinders. GM even got in on the act, with the short-lived Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky. \nMORE: Read our 2016 Mazda MX-5 Miata review \nThe little MX-5 Miata has endured and is entering its fourth generation, which remains true to the original small-roadster concept. The Miata's design and following have earned it a place in the automotive history books along with icons like the Mustang, Viper, Corvette, and M3. \nThe new Mazda MX-5 Miata \nThe 2016 MX-5 Miata has been completely re-engineered and redesigned and, we\u2019re relieved to say, it's a classic on arrival. \nWith the 2016 model, Mazda has brought Miata up to some modern safety, efficiency, and tech expectations, all while preserving that delicate sweet spot that makes it different from anything else on the market. \nThe proportions aren\u2019t that much different, but Mazda has shed a few inches of length and made the car even lower. Its design follows Mazda\u2019s latest \"Kodo\" design, evolved from the Mazda 6, Mazda CX-5, and Mazda 3, and made a little more pert. Inside, the 2016 Mazda MX-5 Miata adopts a design that keeps its low seating, with a prominent center console separating the driver and passenger areas, as well as big, cockpit-style analog gauges and a horizontal, shelf-like instrument panel\u2014although it makes a noticeable concession to modernity in a large, standalone infotainment screen. \nThe new Miata has a layout that's much like its predecessor, yet it's been completely re-engineered, with a new body structure as well as Mazda\u2019s 2.0-liter \"SkyActiv\" direct-injection inline-4 and a high 13:1 compression ratio. The engine\u2019s 155-horsepower and 148 pound-foot ratings aren't impressive on their own, but considering the car's light 2,300-pound curb weight, it's plenty\u2014provided you keep the engine revving. The electric-assist rack-and-pinion steering is very precise, and the front wishbone, rear multi-link suspension, with an even lower seating position this time, helps keep the driver feeling bonded with the car in every twist and turn. \nThe Miata remains a two-seater, with a limited amount of space\u2014just enough for the driver and passenger. Ride quality is reasonably good (although the Club is noticeably stiffer), and wind buffeting with the top down is impressive. The all manual top can be raised or lowered with one arm (thanks to a helper spring) in less than 10 seconds. \nThree different models of the Miata are offered for 2016: a base Sport model, an enthusiast-oriented Club model, and a touring-oriented GT (Grand Touring). The Club model is the most aggressive performance setup available and has a limited-slip differential, Bilstein shocks, and a shock tower brace\u2014brought to its best with a Brembo/BBS brake-and-wheel package. GT models add Bose audio with a subwoofer, a garage-door opener, heated seats, automatic climate control, and leather upholstery, plus 17-inch bright alloy wheels, and you can now option a Miata up with a suite of active-safety features. \nThe 2017 Fiat 124 Spider is assembled alongside the Miata in Japan and a retractable folding roof for the Miata, called the MX-5 Miata RF, will arrive in 2017. \nMazda MX-5 Miata history \nWith Japanese reliability and the personality of something like the legendary Lotus Elan (not to mention similar hideaway headlights in the first generation), the Miata was nothing short of a revolution when it first went on sale in the 1990 model year. A small, two-seat sports car, the Miata was an instant classic. Everything about it recalled classic roadsters, with a long hood and short cabin; a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout; and a design that kept it lean and simple, sometimes at the expense of some comfort. \nThe powertrain in the original Miata was a 1.6-liter inline-4 available with a choice of 5-speed manual or automatic transmissions, growing slightly with each new generation. In 1993 the engine was enlarged to 1.8 liters, and in 1998 the second-generation car was introduced. The same 1.8-liter engine powered the second MX-5 Miata, though it received a slight increase in power. The second-generation Miata offered a Mazdaspeed version in 2004 and 2005, which added a turbocharger to the 1.8-liter engine, increasing output significantly from 130 hp to 178 hp. \nThe third-generation car was introduced in 2005 for the 2006 model year. It again gained a larger engine, up to 2.0 liters and 160 hp standard (167 hp in 2009-2010 models), with a 5- or 6-speed manual transmission, or a 6-speed automatic, though the engine is detuned to 158 hp when paired with the automatic. Six-speed manual models were available with a limited-slip differential. \nWhile the Miata maintained a go-kart-like handling feel, with a low-to-the-road driving position that tends to exaggerate the feeling of speed without breaking the speed limit, the tight cabin can lend a feeling of vulnerability\u2014or intimacy. \nTrue to its essence, the base cloth top on the Miata isn\u2019t power-operated, but it remains easy to open and close with a single hand. For the 2007 model year, however, a clever power-retractable hard top version of the Miata was introduced. Thanks to smart design, the hard top opened and closed quickly, preserved headroom, took up no more trunk space than the cloth top, and created a tight, quiet cabin environment that made driving in cold weather considerably more civilized. \nAn MX-5 Miata Club trim was new for 2013. With a 6-speed manual transmission and a stiffer suspension tune, it had a somewhat sharper driving feel. For the 2015 model year, Mazda effectively signed off on the third-generation Miata with a special 25th Anniversary Edition .", "rating": null, "author": "", "language": "english", "external_links": [], "thread": {"site_full": "www.thecarconnection.com", "site_categories": [], "country": "US", "site": "thecarconnection.com", "spam_score": 0.0, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8.X2SkyW09ozJ5h7MD_3K0hWjEK4I1xj5EO0lxJMJLfhTwhNHxGPDOATLmXuAvcss-", "title_full": "Mazda MX-5 Miata", "replies_count": 0, "social": {"facebook": {"shares": 897, "comments": 0, "likes": 898}, "stumbledupon": {"shares": 62}, "linkedin": {"shares": 8}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 3}, "gplus": {"shares": 2}}, "performance_score": 8, "main_image": "http://images.hgmsites.net/hug/2016-mazda-mx-5-miata_100520116_h.jpg", "uuid": "ecb9f042845b86ea8bbd26c5afa468897df78903", "domain_rank": 12885, "site_type": "news", "published": "2017-04-16T18:00:00.000+03:00", "section_title": "The Car Connection", "title": "Mazda MX-5 Miata", "participants_count": 0, "site_section": "http://www.thecarconnection.com/rss/master"}}, {"highlightTitle": "", "published": "2017-04-15T23:19:01.000+03:00", "crawled": "2017-04-15T23:19:01.000+03:00", "ord_in_thread": 0, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/_0JOtn.4SCorqAO3Hnwr44QalttuAkPqfOHYy_3902d7XsK2qXZudK2.j_ixtQgkSjmn9x7fyZ3Yy5yGbHiUGYepbUglaTJA.Jubl1K4TvEM8vdejj.EklAauxTe.m5T", "title": "This Is The Best Quick, Cheap Fix To Bad In-Car Video Sound Yet", "highlightText": "", "uuid": "99abcc229a09c661d2b050185d38b54b6561e7dd", "entities": {"persons": [{"name": "ryan doherty", "sentiment": "negative"}, {"name": "squeeee clunk vroom", "sentiment": "none"}], "organizations": [{"name": "hella shitty", "sentiment": "none"}, {"name": "bmw", "sentiment": "none"}], "locations": [{"name": "sonoma raceway", "sentiment": "none"}]}, "text": "GIF via Ryan Doherty \nOnboard cameras are all but ubiquitous in race cars now, yet the audio that comes from them often isn\u2019t so great. You may hear the car in the background underneath a harsh layer of windy sounds and mount rattles. Here\u2019s the best cheap fix to bad or nonexistent onboard video audio yet. \nInstead of subjecting us to the usual \u201cw sssshhhhppssss sdjfsjfls\u201d of an onboard video camera\u2019s default audio, the Hella Shitty 24 Hours of LeMons team dubbed in-race car sounds as lovingly recreated by...a mouth.

It sure doesn\u2019t sound like it has a BMW engine based on this video, that\u2019s for sure. Could I be hearing a cheaty-for-LeMons engine swap? Scandal! \nAll jokes aside, unless you went all out and hid a nice external microphone somewhere that\u2019s adequately sheltered from wind noise, I think I know which audio track I\u2019d really rather listen to.
