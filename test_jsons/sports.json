Abeku Wilson (Source: Instagram) \nAbeku Wilson, 33, a body-building enthusiast and ex-employee at the Equinox Fitness Club at the Shops at Merrick Park, is the alleged gunman. \nThe gym\u2019s General Manager, Janine Ackerman, 35, and trainer, Mario Hortis, were in critical condition and airlifted to Ryder Trauma Center, according to CBS4 News partner The Miami Herald. \nMiami-Dade Police said the ex-employee opened fire on his colleagues Saturday afternoon before taking his own life. \nA witness and her husband were paying for drinks at the juice bar when she saw the gunman. \n\u201cI saw an African American guy, very tall, with a black shirt and black shorts,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t smiling and the way he was holding his gun, he looks very serious and bam! bam! I could hear at least two shots first.\u201d Witness tells @CBSMiami how the shooting at Merrick Park happened. pic.twitter.com/TDZNzSKZVR \n\u2014 Jorge K Gonzalez (@jorgekgonzalez) April 8, 2017 \nThe Herald reported that former Miami city commissioner, Marc Sarnoff, who trained with Wilson for about two years, said Wilson bumped into him and another trainer while they were working out, then apologized, saying he was \u201cjust off balance this morning\u201d while nearly slurring his words. \nMoments later, he entered the facility\u2019s second floor and allegedly opened fire on Hortis and Ackerman. \nWilson was described as a nice and quiet guy, who was easily the most popular trainer at Equinox. \nThose who knew him said the shooting was personal and had he wanted to, could have inflicted much more damage on the crowded gym full of regulars exercising and lifting weights. \nSWAT units were stationed around the mall, initially locked down, as shoppers ran to safety and recorded video . Police said it wasn\u2019t an active shooter situation and no one else was hurt.

(MATT BUTTON | AEGIS STAFF/Baltimore Sun) Privacy Policy \nA proposal to make it a violation of the city code to live in a tent or other temporary structure in the City of Aberdeen was essentially killed by the City Council Monday night. \nIn the middle of the public comment portion of the meeting, during which at least 20 people spoke against the legislation, the Aberdeen City Council voted unanimously to postpone voting on it indefinitely. \n\"To prolong this would only create more contention and misunderstanding,\" Councilman Melvin Taylor, who made the motion to dismiss the proposed ordinance, said. \nAs the mayor and five council members cast their yes votes that would \"kill the bill,\" those in the crowded city hall chambers applauded loudly. \nThe ordinance would have made it a violation of the Aberdeen city code to live in a tent or other temporary structure in one place for more than 24 hours at a time. Anyone found in violation could have been fined $50 for each incident. (ERIKA BUTLER) \n\"I have a grave concern for homelessness,\" said Taylor, whose church, Word of Faith International Outreach, has worked with the homeless through the emergency rotating shelter. \nTatiana Ribiero, who is living with Harford Family House with her five children, said after the vote she's \"very, very happy about the situation.\" \nUntil March 22, she and her kids had been living in apartment stairwells. \nJoshua Price, who was also homeless with his children, said it's \"amazing, great\" the city chose to dismiss the ordinance. He, too, got help through Harford Family House and now has a home in Aberdeen. \nMembers of the public called the proposal \"ridiculous,\" and not what people who are homeless need. \nBonnie Prater, of Bel Air, who has been running a ministry through the Christian Church of Bel Air for seven years, said Aberdeen needs to give the homeless hope - spiritual hope, healing hope. \n\"I believe if we are to call ourselves a community of people, then we need to learn how we can work together in unity to bring hope to these homeless,\" Prater said. \"If they know we care about them, a little bit of giving someone hope can go so far.\" \nFollowing the City Council action, the ordinance can not come before the council again unless it is reintroduced as a new ordinance.

Australian teams AAP and staff writers, FOX SPORTS April 9, 2017 6:08pm \nEITHER the Western Force or the Melbourne Rebels are to be axed from Super Rugby after this season, but the Brumbies appear to be in the clear. \nSANZAAR announced on Sunday that the Super Rugby competition will be reduced to 15 teams from next season. \nTwo teams from South Africa and one from Australia will be axed. \nThe Western Force were initially widely tipped to be the Australian team to get the chop. \nBut the Rebels are also now in grave danger, with the Australian Rugby Union now set to let the two endangered franchises plead their case for survival. \nIt\u2019s understood the Brumbies are safe from the axe, leaving the Rebels and Force to battle it out for survival. \nThe ARU has scheduled a media conference for chairman Cameron Clyne and CEO Bill Pulver at 9.30am in Sydney on Monday, but it\u2019s understood they won\u2019t at that point name which team will be cut. \nUnder pressure due to financial losses and fan discontent over the confusing and unbalanced competition, SANZAAR has opted to slash it from 18 teams to 15 and from four conferences to three \u2014 the numbers that existed in 2015. \nAustralia will lose one of its five teams while South Africa loses two of its six teams and New Zealand\u2019s dominant group of five foundation teams remains unchanged. \n\u201cAustralia\u2019s professional rugby players are incredibly frustrated and deeply disappointed by today\u2019s confirmation that the Australian Rugby Union has voted to axe an Australian team from Super Rugby in 2018 and beyond,\u201d Rugby Union Players Association chief executive Ross Xenos said. media_camera RUPA boss Ross Xenos chats with Reds halfback James Tuttle. \n\u201cHaving signed Australian Rugby up to a competition which reduced local content, diluted tribalism and disrespected fans with its lack of integrity, ARU have now agreed to a new model which has protected the expansion teams in Argentina and Japan at the cost of one of our own. \n\u201cDespite receiving $30 million of additional annual broadcast revenue from 2016, the financial challenges of Australian rugby will likely be used to justify today\u2019s short-sighted and ill-conceived decision which will limit the growth of rugby in Australia for generations to come. \n\u201cIt is tomorrow\u2019s players, coaches and fans who will now pay the price for this strategic mismanagement. This decision will be the catalyst for an irresponsible human cost without any genuine remedies to the real strategic issues that the game faces.\u201d media_camera Force players react after losing another game. \nThe three five-team conferences will be New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, with Japan\u2019s Sunwolves to join the Australian conference and Argentina\u2019s Jaguares to play in the South Africa conference. \nSANZAAR left it to the national rugby unions concerned to announce the teams they are cutting. \nThe Port Elizabeth-based Kings and Bloemfontein-based Cheetahs are considered the most vulnerable South African franchises. \n\u201cNaturally we understand that there will be some very disappointed franchises but the tournament\u2019s long-term future and the economic reality of the business at present is something that had to be addressed,\u201d said SANZAAR chairman Brett Impey. \nThe 18-team format, introduced in 2016 after Argentina\u2019s Jaguares and the Sunwolves of Japan joined the competition and the Kings returned, was widely criticised and there were fears the quality of the product was being diluted. \nImpey addressed fans\u2019 concerns at the Sunwolves, with just two wins in their existence, surviving while better-performed teams get axed. \n\u201cThe decision to retain the Sunwolves is linked directly to SANZAAR\u2019s strategic plan for the future,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThe potential for growth of the sport in Asia off the back of the establishment of the Sunwolves and the impending RWC in 2019 is significant.\u201d media_camera SANZAAR CEO Andy Marinos in his previous role as Springboks manager. \nAdded SANZAAR CEO Andy Marinos: \u201cThis has been a long and complex piece of work and we make no apology for that. Super Rugby is unique in world rugby in that it is played in six countries across 15 time zones and has numerous stakeholders. \n\u201cSANZAAR cannot continue to ignore the extensive feedback that it has received from fans, stakeholders and commercial partners around the integrity of the competition format and performances of the teams. We want to see an engaging, vibrant and competitive competition that delivers a strong high performance pathway in all markets that will have a positive flow into the international game. \n\u201cIt became clear during our strategic assessment that there are two facets to the future of our tournaments. The first is a requirement to react to existing market forces within the sporting business environment and to implement short-term change to Super Rugby. This is what we have done. \n\u201cThe second is the longer term vision, through a strategic plan, to build the brand that in the future can maximise further development of the game, commercial revenues and the ongoing sustainability of the tournaments.

Esther Lin, MMA Fighting Daniel Cormier \u2019s dance card is filling up quickly. After successfully defending his UFC light heavyweight title by submitting Anthony Johnson in the second round at UFC 210 on Saturday, Cormier began jawing at Jimi Manuwa who was sitting cageside for the performance. When Joe Rogan asked Cormier what he was saying to Manuwa, the champ said he was telling Manuwa to quit his quest for a title shot. \u201cI told Jimi to stop pretending he wants to fight me,\u201d Cormier said. \u201cHe don\u2019t want none of this. He knows. You can\u2019t beat me, Jimi. Jimi, could come in here with your bare knuckle and punch me. I would eat that. You can\u2019t beat me, Jimi. You know it. Don\u2019t lie to yourself. I like Corey Anderson but you just beat Corey Anderson. Sit down, young man. Sit down.\u201d Manuwa is currently the fourth-ranked light heavyweight in the UFC (though he will move up to third place with the retirement of Johnson) and is coming off an impressive first-round knockout out of seventh-ranked Corey Anderson. After the win, Manuwa called for a title shot against the winner of Cormier-Johnson, saying his catchphrase: \u201cOne shot, one kill.\u201d Now that Cormier\u2019s retained his title, he doesn\u2019t think much of Manuwa\u2019s chances. At the post-fight press conference, Cormier scoffed at the idea of Manuwa giving him any sort of a challenge. \u201cHe\u2019s a tough guy. He punches hard. I like his little thing, \u2018One shot, one kill,\u2019\u201d Cormier said. \u201cIt sounds cool. He wears sweatsuits. A guy that wears sweatsuits is pretty cool. But Jimi Manuwa can\u2019t do me anything. Dude\u2019s done. Jimi Manuwa would be lucky to get out 10 minutes. Seven minutes. I would demoralize him.\u201d Of course, the other option for Cormier would be the long-awaited rematch with former champion Jon Jones . Jones is currently serving a USADA suspension but he is eligible to fight again come July. The UFC has still not said how they intend to handle the often problematic Jones upon his return but Cormier says if Jones wants the fight, that will likely take precedence. \u201cOf course I\u2019d fight Jon Jones but Jimi Manuwa said that he wants a title fight,\u201d Cormier said. \u201cHe\u2019s won a couple of fights in a row and looked impressive. I think he\u2019s a good fighter but it kinda depends on what they do with Jones. If Jones wants to fight somebody first then I guess that\u2019s what they\u2019re gonna do.

(Andrew Redington/Getty   \u2013 Jordan Spieth has so impressed the patrons around these parts that they\u2019ll watch him perform the most routine of tasks. \nAfter hitting his tee shot into the 18th fairway late Saturday afternoon, Spieth took a left turn down a service road that leads to a concession stand and restroom tucked away in the trees. Patrons race-walked \u2013 no running at Augusta National! \u2013 to follow the former Masters champion, who was flanked by an armed police officer. \nOwning a green jacket has its privileges, so Spieth ducked in the restroom\u2019s exit to hasten his pit stop. Security guards stood outside the door as patrons gathered to see when he would emerge. When he did, the crowd followed Spieth for some 70 yards before he shook the officers\u2019 hands and ducked back under the gallery ropes. \nThe detour had no impact on Spieth, who hit the green with his approach shot and two-putted for par to complete a 4-under 68 that was Saturday\u2019s second-lowest round. Now he has an opportunity to excite the patrons once again by adding another record-setting victory to his Masters resume. Spieth is playing just his fourth Masters, but already he is a stalwart on Augusta National's leaderboards because of the way Alister Mackenzie's creation encourages his shot-making and rewards his world-class putting. \nAt 4-under 212 (75-69-68), Spieth is two shots behind co-leaders Justin Rose and Sergio Garcia despite starting his fourth Masters with a 75. Spieth, 23, already set the tournament\u2019s 72-hole scoring record in his dominant 2015 victory. Another win Sunday would make him the youngest two-time winner in tournament history and the second-fastest to claim two green jackets. Only Horton Smith, who won two of the first three tournaments held at Augusta National, collected them quicker. \nSpieth is in an unfamiliar position at Augusta National, though. This is the first time he doesn\u2019t hold at least a share of the third-round lead. Already owning one green jacket makes Sunday\u2019s objective simple for Spieth. \n\u201cI plan to play aggressively because at this point it\u2019s win or go home,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cFinishing fifth versus 10th doesn\u2019t mean much to me, so that frees me up a bit tomorrow.\u201d Jordan Spieth has embraced the fans at Augusta National, and the fans have embraced him. (Rob Carr/Getty Images) \nRose played with Spieth in the final group two years ago. Both players shot 70 on the final day as Spieth won by four shots. He\u2019s seen firsthand what Spieth can do on this golf course. \n\u201cIt's a second\u2011shot golf course, and he's a good iron player. He's very sharp with that,\u201d Rose said. \u201cHe's got a great golfing brain. This is a very strategic golf course and you have to make good, smart decisions out there. It tempts you at times. It can dangle the carrot. You need to be on top of your thinking and he's very good at that, and his putting speaks for itself. \n\u201cThese greens obviously require imagination. They break a lot, so to see the lines is key. But when you pick your line and pick it well, they go in, so it rewards good putting.\u201d \nSpieth has a tall task ahead of him, though. No player has won the Masters when trailing by more than seven shots after the first round. Spieth was 10 behind after he shot a 75 on Thursday that included a quadruple-bogey on the par-5 15th hole. It was his second consecutive round at Augusta National with a quad, but this time he has 57 holes, not six, to recover. \nSpieth\u2019s second-round 69 pulled him within four shots of the lead. He played the next 36 holes in 7 under par, including a bogey-free stretch of 29 holes that started on Friday\u2019s fifth hole and ended with a three-putt at No. 16 late Saturday afternoon. \n\u201cYesterday\u2019s round was huge, and it was bigger than today\u2019s in my opinion, because it gave me that chance,\u201d Spieth said Saturday. \u201cI went to bed with my heart pumping faster last night.\u201d \nCraig Stadler (1982) is the only player to win the Masters after shooting 75 in the first round. He shot 69-67 the next two days \u2013 one better than Spieth \u2013 before a final-round 73 forced a playoff with Dan Pohl, who also started the week with a 75. Stadler won when Pohl missed a 6-foot par putt on the first extra hole. \nSpieth will play in Sunday\u2019s second-to-last group with Rickie Fowler, who\u2019s one shot ahead of him. Ryan Moore and Charley Hoffman are tied with Spieth, while two Masters champions, Adam Scott and Charl Schwartzel, are 3 under and 2 under, respectively. \n\u201cJordan Spieth is a huge threat to this tournament,\u201d Scott said. I plan to play aggressively because at this point it\u2019s win or go home. - Jordan Spieth \nHe wasn\u2019t after he made the turn Friday, still sitting 3 over par for the week. He made six birdies and no bogeys over the next 18 holes, then closed the third round by making birdie on the second nine\u2019s two par-5s before the three-putt at the par-3 16th. \n\u201cWe fought back tremendously to have a chance to win this golf tournament,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cNo matter what happens at the end, we will have a chance to win with a really good round tomorrow.\u201d \nSpieth has drawn inspiration from Tom Brady and Arnold Palmer this week, but he also has his own history that he can use for inspiration. \nOn Saturday, Spieth hit his tee shot on No. 13 into the pine straw right of the fairway, not far from where Phil Mickelson hit his miraculous recovery en route to his 2010 win here, and debated with caddie Michael Greller about whether to go for the green with his second shot. \nBefore hitting a 4-iron onto the green and two-putting for birdie, Spieth asked, \u201cWhat would Arnie do?\u201d He was pleased when he learned later that the telecast\u2019s microphones picked up that comment. This is the first Masters since Palmer\u2019s passing in September. Patrons have been given \u201cArnie\u2019s Army\u201d badges this week, and Palmer was honored in an emotional ceremony on the first tee Thursday. There was a moment of silence as his green jacket was draped over one of the white lawn chairs that he, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player would sit in as they waited to hit the tournament\u2019s honorary first tee shots. \n\u201cI think Mike (Greller) was taken aback,\u201d Spieth said about the rhetorical question. \u201c\u2019What would Arnie do?\u2019 was my way of expressing it to Michael. We all know exactly what he would have done. I\u2019m proud that I pulled that shot off.\u201d \"I didn't know going into my first (Masters) if I would have five chances in my life .. So it's awesome.\" \u2014 PGA TOUR (@PGATOUR) April 9, 2017 \nSpieth had to lay up on the par-5 15th hole, which is exactly how Thursday\u2019s troubles started. He hit his third shot into the water, hit the next one over the green and then three-putted. Not this time. Spieth\u2019s approach shot spun back to within 3 feet of the hole. \nSpieth played Augusta National with Brady two weeks ago, and cited the Patriots\u2019 most recent Super Bowl victory as further proof that no deficit is too large. He doesn\u2019t need to look at anyone else\u2019s performances, though. \n\u201cI\u2019ve come back and won tournaments before, all the way from six back on the PGA TOUR,\u201d he said. \u201cI can draw off those experiences.\u201d \nAnd perhaps add another green jacket in record-setting fashion.

Article continues below \nIt's true he will face stiff competition from the likes of Gianluigi Donnarumma, Kylian Mbappe and Ousmane Dembele but nevertheless, it is another impressive milestone for Rashford. \nWith just over a year's worth of experience under his belt, the young star has already accomplished plenty. Article continues below Man United's starting XI when Cristiano Ronaldo made his debut in 2003 \nThe 19-year-old is a regular for club and country, has already picked up two major trophies and is widely regarded as one of the most promising prospects England has to offer right now. \nAnd despite his rapid rise, Rashford remains as humble and dedicated as ever - never forgetting his journey to where he is now. \nOn Monday he tweeted a picture of himself from just eight years ago accompanied by something he wrote about his future and aims. \nThere weren't any wavering doubts in Rashford's mind what he wanted to be when he was growing up. Football was his only goal. \nAn 11-year-old Rashford wrote: \"I hope that my future is very bright in and out of school especially in my career as a footballer. \n\"I want to have a different lifestyle and make my family and others proud of me. \n\"I ONLY HAVE ONE AIM IN LIFE AND THAT IS TO BE A PROFESSIONAL FOOTBALLER, AND HOPEFULLY AT MANCHESTER UNITED.\" \nTalk about living the dream! \nEight years later, Rashford is earning his keep as a professional footballer and at Man United. \nIt is just the type of reflective social media post that fans love and you can hardly blame United fans revelling in the final part of his prediction. Here is the best reaction on social media: \nSunday's late goal against the Black Cats would have certainly given Rashford a timely confidence boost to kick on for the final stages of the campaign. \nBagging a few more goals between now and the end of the season definitely won't harm his Golden Boy chances either! \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?

The third baseman grabbed the bouncer with his bare hand and threw across the diamond, getting the out at first for a second-inning gem in Friday's 7-3 loss to the D-backs. \n\"He's really played a good third base,\" manager Terry Francona said on Saturday. \"That was a nice play.\" Full Game Coverage \nDefense was the main question mark hovering over Diaz during Spring Training, when Cleveland had a roster spot to fill with second baseman Jason Kipnis opening the season on the 10-day disabled list. The Indians moved Jose Ramirez from third to second, and rolled the dice on Diaz, who is more polished as a hitter than as a third baseman. \nIn the first week of the season, Diaz has looked solid in the field for the Tribe. He made a diving catch to his right in the season opener on Monday, robbing Texas' Nomar Mazara of a possible hit. Friday night's barehanded grab-and-throw was another play to add to Diaz's highlight reel. \nOffensively, Diaz has hit only .200 through his first 16 plate appearances, but the sample size is small. Francona has been impressed by the rookie's approach and pointed out that Diaz has run into some tough luck. To that end, Diaz entered Saturday as one of only 18 Major Leaguers (and the only Indians player) with at least three balls in play with an exit velocity of 106 mph or higher, per Statcast\u2122 . Only one of the three went for a hit. \n\"That kind of puts a dent in your average,\" Francona said. \"But, I think his at-bats have been solid, too. I think Yandy, you're going to look up a couple years from now and he's going to be doing some severe damage. Just the way he hits, the way he's built, I think he's got so much room to get better, and it's exciting.\" \nOther items of note from Saturday: \n\u2022 Right fielder Lonnie Chisenhall (on the 10-day DL with a right shoulder issue) went 1-for-4 for Triple-A Columbus in his first Minor League rehab assignment Friday. He is scheduled to play the outfield for Columbus on Saturday, and is on target to be activated in time for Tuesday's home opener. Kipnis (right shoulder) is set to begin a rehab assignment with Double-A Akron on Sunday. \n\u2022 Francona is looking for spots early in the season to give left fielder Michael Brantley some rest, considering he is coming back from multiple surgeries on his right arm. With a lefty (Patrick Corbin) starting for the D-backs on Sunday, Brantley might be out of the lineup, according to Francona. \n\u2022 When Kipnis is ready to be activated, Francona said he plans on sitting down with the second baseman and Brantley to get their thoughts on the batting order. As of now, the manager is not sure how he will handle the lineup when Kipnis comes back.   Read his blog, Major League Bastian , follow him on Twitter @MLBastian and listen to his podcast .

They face Juventus in the first leg of their Champions League quarter-final tie on Tuesday. Mascherano, Messi and Suarez spoke together \nAnd according to Sport , the players had already turned their focus towards Juventus. Javier Mascherano, Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez sat together, eating food, with Mascherano leading the inquest. \nSuarez joined in as the defender used water bottles to recreate tactical situations. Messi was more quiet, chipping in with a few comments. \nUnlike other defeats, the players weren\u2019t silent. They were disappointed but kept their heads high and searched for solutions. \nAndres Iniesta and Sergio Busquets were both equally serious about making sure Barca bounce back in style in Turin.

Does that mean they will host the final too? He said the plan called for the quarterfinal rounds and on to go to the U.S., so that is the idea, but he did acknowledge that FIFA gets to make the final decision. \n\"Everything gets decided in conjunction with FIFA,\" he said. \nThe opening match, Gulati said, has not been discussed. Ian MacNicol Getty Images 2 Will FIFA accept the plan to have the U.S. host the vast majority of matches? \nIt's a joint bid, but there is clearly one nation leading the way. The proposal will call for the U.S. to host 60 games while Mexico and Canada will each host 10. It seems like Mexico and Canada are playing minor roles in a bid that is practically the USA's bid. But as Gulati put it referring to FIFA: \"This is our proposal. It's their tournament.\" 3 How many different stadiums and cities will host games? \nRegardless of whether the joint bid wins the rights to host the 2026 World Cup, it'll be the first World Cup featuring 48 teams. FIFA has said it would aim to have the tournament completed in the same amount of time as the current 32-team World Cup, but there will be a huge increase in games and thus more stadiums needed. How many different stadiums and cities will be needed? \nGulati said that they want to host it in as many cities as possible, but how many that is remains to be seen. LatinContent LatinContent/Getty Images 4 How will travel across the border work for teams and fans? \nThis is a big concern. Only one other joint World Cup has been hosted, the 2002 World Cup in Japan and South Korea, and it had its share of logistical issues. Travel across borders around the world has become even stricter and more tightly regulated since then. President Trump's recent attempts to limit travel from certain nations only complicates matters even more. Working out visas and ensuring travel between cities is difficult enough for any World Cup, but now it needs to happen across three different countries. 5 Will all three host nations get automatic qualifying spots? \nFIFA president Gianni Infantino has expressed his support for a joint bid, but there are no guarantees that each of the hosts will earn an automatic World Cup spot, as hosts traditionally do. The FIFA Council makes the final determination, which everyone associated with the bid acknowledged, but Gulati and Canada's Victor Montagliani made it clear they expect all three to earn spots. AP 6 How much investment will be needed for stadium and infrastructure upgrades? \nSince Mexico and Canada will only host 10 games each, there may be less need for them to take on serious construction projects, but they may use the World Cup as an opportunity to improve some facilities. Gulati said the U.S. is aiming to spread the tournament across as many venues as possible because the USA has plenty of stadiums capable of hosting a World Cup. He also said that the bid is built on existing venues so the goal is to keep costs down across all three countries. \nStill, because the regulations for the 2026 World Cup have yet to be finalized by FIFA, there are question marks. \n\"It's impossible to say,\" Gulati said of the cost, adding that they are waiting on the final rules from FIFA before doing so. 7 Will all the World Cup matches be grass or turf? \nEvery men's World Cup has been on natural grass, but Canada conspicuously hosted the Women's World Cup in 2015 entirely on artificial surfaces. It was a controversial decision since no senior World Cup had ever been held on anything but grass. So will Canada convert their stadiums to natural grass for the 2026 World Cup? \n\"We haven't discussed any of that here, but I'm sure that's FIFA's decision,\" Montagliani said, noting that the World Cup has always been on grass. Getty Images Rich Lam 8 Who is bidding against them? \nRight now, the joint bid looks like the clear frontrunner, especially since no other serious bidders have come forward. FIFA has already said that Europe and Asia are ineligible to bid on the 2026 World Cup, because the two continents are hosting in 2018 and 2022. That leaves only bids from Africa and South America to compete with the North American bid, but no other countries have stepped up. That may change by the time the host will be decided in 2020, but for now, the joint CONCACAF bid has no real competition. This content is subject to copyright.

It\u2019s the immune system attacking the insulation. \nMedications can slow the disease but don\u2019t stop it. Stem cells may be much better. \nAs Dr. Max reports, walking on a treadmill is a big step for Malia Litman. She had been a top trial attorney in Dallas until she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 18 years ago. Slowly, the disease robbed her of her balance, her mobility and her energy. \n\u201cYou can imagine how contracted my world had become,\u201d she says. \nAfter she fell and broke her leg, she was in a wheelchair for weeks. Her MS medicines weren\u2019t really working anymore. \nHer search for alternative treatments led to Dr. Dimitrios Karussis. \n\u201cAnswers for our diseases and our medical problems are hidden inside our body,\u201d he says. \nKarussis heads the experimental stem cell research at Hadassah Medical Organization in Israel. He harvests an MS patient\u2019s own adult stem cells from their bone marrow, then injects them back into their spinal fluid. \n\u201cAs neurologists, we have never seen or even believed that it is possible to reverse any disability,\u201d he says. \nLitman says within 24 hours of her first treatment, \u201cI picked up my leg and went, \u2018Oh my god,\u2019 and I just started crying.\u201d \nShe says her speech is more clear and she has more energy, and she\u2019s adamant it\u2019s not a placebo effect, pointing to a number of tests before and after treatment that show improvement. \nKarussis says one patient was even able to walk again. \nResearchers are now collaborating with teams at the Mayo Clinic and Harvard, finishing a double-blind study to prove its effectiveness. \n\u201cLook what I can do now! It\u2019s amazing,\u201d Litman says. \nShe still uses her walker but can now get on her rowing machine. After four treatments, she\u2019s reactivated her law license and is taking on a case. \n\u201cI feel like I have my life back. I don\u2019t care if I walk with a walker the rest of my life. Although I think I may actually be able to walk again with a couple more treatments,\u201d she says. \nAs Dr. Max reports, the theory is that the stem cells are somehow spurring the regeneration of the insulating nerve sheaths that are deteriorating in MS. \nHowever, the course of the disease is so variable that Litman\u2019s improvement may not be due to the stem cell treatment. That\u2019s why the double-blind study is so important. \nHadassah Medical Organization\u2019s researchers are also looking at the treatment\u2019s effect on ALS patients.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "title": "Adult stem cell treatment might reverse multiple sclerosis symptoms", "external_links": [], "entities": {"organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "mayo clinic"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cbs2"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "harvard"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "hadassah medical organization"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "dallas"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "new york"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "israel"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "max gomez"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dimitrios karussis"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "max"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "karussis"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "malia litman"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "litman"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-11T12:59:32.295+03:00", "published": "2017-04-10T21:57:00.000+03:00"}, {"url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg88b0gBwyTUfsj6AH0E7mXZCiYyjziPl5RRrm_ap0Xdbum46y0AD5ODujgkYeH1Ok6IJ5mC0gr3_A--", "uuid": "9ff786337fa7c20aad1de1b4d622a5df4cadb136", "thread": {"country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg88b0gBwyTUfsj6AH0E7mXZCiYyjziPl5RRrm_ap0Xdbum46y0AD5ODujgkYeH1Ok6IJ5mC0gr3_A--", "uuid": "9ff786337fa7c20aad1de1b4d622a5df4cadb136", "title_full": "GAME RECAP: Heat 106, Wizards 103", "replies_count": 0, "site_section": "http://www.nba.com/rss/highlights.rss", "site": "nba.com", "performance_score": 9, "site_full": "www.nba.com", "site_type": "news", "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 913, "shares": 913, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}}, "participants_count": 0, "site_categories": ["sports"], "section_title": "NBA.com - Video", "title": "GAME RECAP: Heat 106, Wizards 103", "domain_rank": 537, "main_image": "", "published": "2017-04-09T06:54:32.900+03:00"}, "highlightText": "", "rating": null, "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "author": "", "text": "\u276e Back GAME RECAP: Heat 106, Wizards 103 Hassan Whiteside scores 30 points, grabs 12 rebounds and dishes two assists as the Heat defeat the Wizards, 106-103.

Even though the team finished 7-9 and was competitive after a slow start, Rex Ryan was fired following just his second season in western New York . \nThere were warning signs it might not go well. Specifically when Rex decided to bring his brother Rob Ryan in as the defensive coordinator , a move that felt like a force at the time and certainly carried some all-or-nothing potential to it. \nThe gamble flamed out, and according to a report from Gary Myers of the New York Daily News on Sunday, there were absolutely some issues relating to the Ryan Bros and how things went down in Orchard Park. \nAccording to Myers, Rex \u201cbasically dedicated\u201d last year to \u201cresurrecting the reputation\u201d of Rob and gave him the \u201crun of the place.\u201d \nAccording to a well-placed source, Rex Ryan basically dedicated the 2016 season to resurrecting the reputation of his brother Rob, who most recently had been fired by the Cowboys and Saints . Rob was not the Bills defensive coordinator but had the run of the place. He was almost the co-head coach. It backfired on Rex and they both got canned. Bills owner Terry Pegula was so anxious to end the Ryan reign of error that he let him go with three years and $16.5 million left on his contract. Rex was so concerned about his brother that the staff became dysfunctional. Rex groupies will find it hard to believe it was his fault, but some of his actions behind the scenes were indicative of a coach with a death wish. \nThe Saints rather unceremoniously dumped Rob from his previous job and the brothers clearly weren\u2019t thrilled about how things went down. \nSo with Rex having an opening at the defensive coordinator spot, he brought Rob in. The result was Rex piling on the pounds ( he gained 30 pounds by early August ) and the two promising to go nuclear on anyone who had ever wronged them . \nThings didn\u2019t quite play out with the Ryans setting the league on fire ; instead things started so poorly that Rex fired offensive coordinator Greg Roman just two weeks into the season.

later, CSIS\u2019s white supremacy infiltrator tells his story Former CSIS spy Grant Bristow revisits his life in the hate-filled inner circles of the Heritage Front, and warns that he sees signs of a dangerous resurgence in white supremacy today. CSIS agent Grant Bristow outside Dachau concentration camp in 1991. A watchdog's report said Bristow \u201ctested the limits\u201d of what was acceptable as an undercover agent. ( Grant Bristow ) Sun., April 9, 2017 In a bedroom community in Western Canada, a 59-year-old man is living an unremarkable life. He has a wonderful wife, three dogs and a marketing consulting gig. He loves sports and live music, especially if U2 or Lady Gaga are headlining. He plays bridge, though not nearly as much as he would like. His life is the picture of ordinary; the man is anything but. Old habits hint at a secret past. In large crowds, he still scans for surveillance vantage points. He makes sure his home address never appears on his mail or driver\u2019s licence. He will give you a name, but it won\u2019t be his real one \u2014 that would be Grant Bristow, an identity he hasn\u2019t used in 23 years.   In 1994, Bristow disappeared from his Mississauga home after an explosive story in the Toronto Sununmasked him as a CSIS spy who had infiltrated the Heritage Front. At the time, the Heritage Front was Canada\u2019s most influential white supremacist organization. Bristow was its co-founder. By the time the story hit newsstands, Bristow \u2014 along with his then wife and stepson \u2014 had fled to a safe house, fearing retaliation from the white supremacists he\u2019d betrayed. A media frenzy ensued. Two decades later, one of the controversy\u2019s central mysteries \u2014 who is Grant Bristow? \u2014 remains a question with many answers. \u201cHe\u2019s a mercenary. He\u2019ll say anything if the price is right,\u201d says one of the white supremacists Bristow spied on. \u201cHe wanted to be heroic and he was,\u201d says a Jewish man who was once targeted by the Heritage Front. \u201cHe\u2019s a master manipulator,\u201d according to the journalist who exposed Bristow. \u201cWhen someone like that is acting on behalf of the state, we need to manage him properly \u2014 and they didn\u2019t.\u201d For its part, the civilian watchdog tasked with overseeing Canada\u2019s intelligence agency launched an investigation into the scandal-plagued undercover operation. In its 220-page report, the Security Intelligence Review Committee (SIRC) concluded that Bristow \u201ctested the limits\u201d of what was acceptable \u2014 and that the Canadian Security Intelligence Service failed at times to properly manage its source \u2014 but in the balance, he and his handler \u201cdischarged their duties in a competent and responsible manner.\u201d \u201c(They) believed that they were doing valuable work helping to protect Canadian society from a cancer growing within,\u201d read the report issued Dec. 9, 1994. \u201cThey deserve our thanks.\u201d Many critics of the CSIS operation consider the SIRC report a whitewash, written by a government-appointed watchdog of a government agency. But it is the closest Canadians will ever get to an official version of what truly happened. Perhaps unsurprisingly, it is also the narrative Bristow agrees with most. In his first extended interview since 2004, Bristow revisited his six-year sojourn in the hate-filled inner circles of white supremacy and the clandestine world of intelligence gathering, and warned that he sees signs of a dangerous resurgence in white supremacist activity. He also offered his own version of who Grant Bristow really is. Nothing about Bristow\u2019s childhood suggested he was headed for a future in spycraft or white supremacy. Bristow says he was born in Winnipeg in 1958, the last of three children of a banker and civilian military employee. When he was 11, his parents divorced and he moved to Halifax with his mother before settling in Toronto in 1971. Bristow describes his teenage self as an \u201cunremarkable\u201d C student, no more enthralled with James Bond than the next kid. One of his ambitions was to become an accountant. That ambition never really came to pass. Soon after he obtained his accounting certification, an unexpected opportunity \u2014 one he declines to explain \u2014 veered him toward the considerably sexier world of private investigations. Bristow has been described as a skilled investigator and expert manipulator. He also has another convenient talent. \u201cI\u2019m immune to boredom,\u201d Bristow says. \u201cYou have to have patience. It\u2019s never a short game.\u201d In early 1986, Bristow was suddenly sucked into the margins of South Africa\u2019s anti-apartheid struggle \u2014 and spat right back out onto CSIS\u2019s doorstep. Bristow and his colleague were contacted by a South African diplomat, who wanted to meet at the swank Sutton Place Hotel to discuss a potential security job for the country\u2019s Canadian consulate. Bristow vividly remembers meeting a \u201cperfect GQ model\u201d look-alike. \u201cHe was right out of central casting,\u201d Bristow recalls. \u201cThe perfect haircut. The perfectly tailored Brooks Brothers suit.\u201d The meeting unfolded normally, until the diplomat casually dropped a bomb: gee, it sure would be nice if the South African government could identify these pesky Canadian agitators. Bristow was shocked. As he saw it, a foreign government was effectively asking him to spy on Canadians exercising their democratic right to protest. He promised to look into it but called a friend instead, asking him for advice. The friend connected him with a CSIS officer. Just like that, Bristow entered the rarefied doors of Canada\u2019s national security apparatus. Bristow can\u2019t divulge what happened next but according to the SIRC report, Canada\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs expelled a South African diplomat as \u201cpersona non grata\u201d on Aug. 20, 1986, and refused entry to a second. His next assignment was less successful. According to the SIRC report, Bristow was redirected to a new target after he revealed he had an acquaintance who worked with a far-right extremist. Bristow indicated \u201che would be willing to infiltrate\u201d the far right on behalf of CSIS. According to SIRC, the intelligence agency found Bristow to be \u201csomewhat overzealous,\u201d twice violating confidentiality by telling other people about his CSIS association. They told him they no longer needed his help. But Bristow came calling again the following year. He says he reached out to CSIS after bumping into an acquaintance at a Beaches coffee shop. The pair was approached by a third man, whom Bristow didn\u2019t recognize. \u201cBoom, this next character shows up,\u201d he says. \u201cHe sits down, starts telling us about how he gave evidence at a sedition trial in the United States.\u201d Bristow later learned he was Max French, a white supremacist. The sedition trial in question involved 13 neo-Nazis accused of conspiring to kill federal officials and overthrow the U.S. government. At this point, CSIS had growing concerns with far-right extremists and Bristow was \u201cbest equipped to keep us abreast of developments,\u201d according to the SIRC report. Bristow says he was asked if he could fit in with some white supremacists and have a \u201clook-see.\u201d \u201cThat look-see turned into something bigger,\u201d Bristow says. \u201cI never imagined it would become \u2026 this. \u201d CSIS agent Grant Bristow, right, with Heritage Front leader Wolfgang Droege. When the men met in 1989, Bristow sized Droege up as someone with dangerous potential. What \u201cthis\u201d eventually turned into was a targeting investigation called \u201cOperation Governor.\u201d But first, a new, purportedly racist Grant Bristow had to be created. This racist Bristow told people he was an orphan \u2014 no family, no girlfriend \u2014 who lived in a High Park apartment, Bristow\u2019s \u201coperational\u201d home. Bristow knew little about the neo-Nazi movement and its players. So his first move was to call a guy who knew a guy who knew Don Andrews, leader of the racist Nationalist Party who was jailed in 1985 for hate crimes. Bristow scored an invitation to Andrews\u2019 east-end home, where he held regular Nationalist Party meetings. To hear Bristow describe these weekend gatherings, they had an almost churchlike vibe; an impassioned Andrews would sermonize, while his followers \u2014 whom Bristow called \u201cAndroids\u201d\u2014 stifled yawns. Except the gospel Andrews preached was Aryan racial unity. And the congregants, according to Bristow, were a mix of middle-aged racists and eye-rolling skinheads who \u201cwould have preferred that there was loud music and fewer old people.\u201d Sitting in Andrews\u2019 kitchen, Bristow saw an authoritarian cultlike figure. He also saw that his credibility was waning. \u201cOne of these guys used to say to me, on a somewhat regular basis, \u2018There\u2019s got to be more to it than this.\u2019\u201d That something more arrived in April 1989, when a man named Wolfgang Droege stepped off a plane. From a neo-Nazi perspective, Droege had serious bona fides. Known as \u201cWolfie\u201d to friends, the stocky ex-convict was deported from the U.S. after serving four years in prison for drugs and weapons offences. He was previously jailed for conspiring to violently invade the Caribbean island of Dominica and establish a racist haven. Droege was affiliated with neo-Nazi terror groups and was friends with David Duke, the former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. The German-born Droege also grew up idolizing Nazis. \u201cAt the age of 8, he resolved that he, too \u2014 like his father and like his grandfather \u2014 would grow to be a Nazi,\u201d Warren Kinsella wrote in Web of Hate , his book on Canada\u2019s extreme far right. \u201cIn time he would get his wish, and become perhaps the most powerful neo-Nazi leader Canada has known in the postwar years.\u201d Bristow sized Droege up as someone with dangerous potential and a growing distaste for Andrews\u2019 leadership. He also noticed that like his mentor, David Duke, Droege was a \u201cplainclothes racist,\u201d a white supremacist who understood the necessity of mainstream appeal. \u201cWith Droege, presentation was everything. We were \u2018racialists,\u2019 not \u2018racists,\u2019\u201d Bristow says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to look like the average guy on the street to have credibility.\u201d Bristow says the \u201cmagic moment\u201d that cemented their friendship occurred, of all places, on an airplane coming home from Libya. In 1989, Moammar Gadhafi\u2019s revolutionary government was planning a 20th anniversary celebration, culminating with a parade at Tripoli Stadium. But as a pariah state, it clearly struggled with the guest list; an invitation was cordially extended to Andrews\u2019 racist Nationalist Party. \u201cThey needed some white faces in the audience,\u201d Andrews said. Andrews sent 17 party members on the trip, including Bristow. On Aug. 26, 1989, a ragtag group of excited white supremacists packed their sunscreen and set off on an improbable African adventure. There were snags from the start but the real trouble came after they had already left Libya. On his return flight, Droege suddenly realized the plane was stopping over in Chicago \u2014 and his prison release conditions barred him from re-entering the United States. Upon touching down, the entire group was detained and strip-searched and Droege was arrested. Bristow stayed behind in Chicago to help Droege with his legal counsel and bail, which was paid using $1,000 given to the group by the Libyans. After 48 hours, Droege was released and dumped at the Canadian border. The ordeal was a turning point for their relationship, \u201csolidifying that trust and camaraderie,\u201d Bristow says. \u201cAt one point, Droege said to me, \u2018If you think you need to leave, you can leave.\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m with you.\u2019\u201d It was also a crossroads for Toronto\u2019s white supremacist scene. Angered by the Libyan episode, Droege broke off from the Nationalist Party and formed a new group. He called it the Heritage Front. In the 1990s, anti-racist activists, like these protesters, clashed with the white supremacist Heritage Front, sometimes violently. ( Peter Power ) In the late \u201980s, there were some 130 far right groups across Canada. The Heritage Front aspired to unite them all. Droege had outlandish ambitions, like buying land in Peterborough and taking over the town council to create racist bylaws. But broadly speaking, the Heritage Front had two wings, according to the SIRC report \u2014 one for political propaganda and a skinhead \u201ccommando unit.\u201d \u201cDroege formed an organization that had far more intensity, and far more ability to wreak havoc than any organization prior to that time,\u201d says Bernie Farber, who was then a senior official with the Canadian Jewish Congress. The Heritage Front\u2019s inner circle, or \u201cbrethren,\u201d comprised the group\u2019s founding members who paid the $350 in startup fees: Droege, two other Nationalist Party defectors, and Bristow. Bristow\u2019s role as a founding member drew considerable outrage when it first emerged that he was a CSIS mole the whole time. Would the Heritage Front have existed if not for Bristow and his government backers? The SIRC investigators ultimately concluded yes. In his interviews with SIRC, Droege said he had already had the idea for the Heritage Front for a number of years. \u201cI felt eventually it would happen, because I totally disagreed with Mr. Andrews\u2019 positions or his views,\u201d Droege said under oath. After the Heritage Front formed, Droege was designated a \u201clevel 2\u201d target and Operation Governor commenced. Droege, CSIS believed, had the potential to become the \u201cleading Aryan movement personality in Canada.\u201d \u201cIf this scenario were to materialize, (CSIS) would be fortunate to have a source in on the ground floor,\u201d SIRC wrote in its report. In just a few years, the Heritage Front grew to become Canada\u2019s most prominent white supremacist organization, linked to violent American neo-Nazis and amassing a collective rap sheet with assault, robbery and other criminal charges. This period in Bristow\u2019s life was marked by two close relationships. The first, the phoney one, was with Droege, who counted Bristow as not only his right-hand man but also a friend, the kind of pal he called on Christmas Day when he wanted to flee an annoying family gathering. Bristow had much less time for his other relationship, though he considered it the more important one. About a year after Operation Governor began, he fell in love with his first wife, a colleague from work. It\u2019s hard to imagine how Bristow found time to date. At this stage, he was working 18- to 19-hour days, toggling between an unpredictable day job and an even more unpredictable gig as an on-call white supremacist \u2014 all while having near-daily communications with his CSIS handler. But the relationship endured, even after his girlfriend \u2014 whose stepfather was Jewish \u2014 discovered Bristow\u2019s white supremacist affiliations from a newspaper article. (At this juncture, Bristow says, she was brought into the loop). Bristow even got married in a 150-guest wedding, all while keeping his new wife and stepson a secret from his Heritage Front associates. His engagement was nearly derailed, however.

The Spanish star was tied with Justin Rose after 72 holes at nine strokes under par, forcing a sudden-death playoff. After Rose bogeyed the 19th hole of the day, Garcia birdied to end what had become a trend of disappointments in golf's biggest events. PGA Tour shared video of the final putt: PGA TOUR @PGATOUR Justin Ray of Golf Channel noted why this was a long time coming: Justin Ray @JustinRayGC Charl Schwartzel finished strong to put himself alone in third place at six under for the tournament. Here are the final results from Sunday: It was effectively a two-man race for most of the day, with Rose and Garcia in the final pairing pulling away from the field early. Garcia built a three-stroke lead after earning birdies on two of the first three holes, followed by a Rose bogey on the fifth. Of course, it was still way too early to start crowning anyone. Rose forced himself back into the competition with three straight birdies on sixth, seventh and eighth holes. Jason Sobel of ESPN.com broke down the action: Jason Sobel @JasonSobelESPN 4/9/2017, 8:42:05 PM Although Garcia was bogey-free through the front nine, his history of collapses came to the forefront with bogeys on the next two holes. When the Spaniard put his ball in the woods on No. 13, virtually everyone seemed to think the tournament was over. However, he bounced back to earn a par on the hole, while Rose missed a makeable birdie putt and settled for a par as well. Trey Wingo of ESPN summed up the swing: trey wingo @wingoz We still have a tournament! Can't believe Justin and Sergio just made the same score on that hole.. 4/9/2017, 9:59:56 PM The momentum shifted from there, as Garcia birdied the ensuing hole and a had dramatic eagle on No. 15 to earn a tie: The two men went into the 18th hole deadlocked, but each missed a birdie putt that would've won the tournament. Zach Johnson, who missed the cut this week, gave his analysis on the shots: Zach Johnson @ZachJohnsonPGA The playoff was decided before the green, however, with a poor tee shot dooming Rose. He ended with a bogey, giving Garcia the chance to win with a par. Garcia holed his birdie putt just for good measure. Notable stars congratulated the veteran after coming through with the win: Tiger Woods @TigerWoods 4/9/2017, 11:37:58 PM Rory McIlroy @McIlroyRory 2 unbelievable players and 2 great friends, but I couldn't be happier for @TheSergioGarcia. You deserve it all amigo!! Matt Kuchar remained competitive thanks to an incredible performance on the back nine. He posted three straight birdies and then turned heads with a hole-in-one on No. 16: PGA TOUR @PGATOUR 4/9/2017, 9:21:00 PM He finished with a 31 on the last nine holes and 67 overall for the day, putting him at five under for the tournament. Being the first among the leaders into the clubhouse also set a respectable mark for the top players to match. Thomas Pieters followed it up with a five-under finish of his own, featuring four straight birdies on the back nine. Meanwhile, Schwartzel continued the trend with four birdies after the turn to finish in third place. Even those not on the leaderboard came away with memorable moments, including Russell Henley with this eagle on No. 5: PGA TOUR @PGATOUR 4/9/2017, 6:49:59 PM This helped him finish with a 69 in his final round, good enough for a surprising tie for 11th place. Rory McIlroy quietly finished tied for seventh after coming into the day at even par. He managed four birdies and just a single bogey to end up three strokes under par. On the other hand, the final round wasn't quite as good for Jordan Spieth. The 2015 Masters champion had stormed back from a 75 in Round 1 to contention with back-to-back rounds in the 60s, but he fell apart Sunday with a final-round score of 75. He ended up tied for 11th place along with Rickie Fowler, who posted a 76 in the same pairing. Still, this tournament was about Garcia, who survived an exciting battle to win the first major of the year. Many of these players will move to Hilton Head, South Carolina, next week for the RBC Heritage. The Players Championship will bring a lot of big international names back to the United States in May, while the next major will be the U.S. Open on June 15. Post-Round Reaction Perhaps the most impressive part of the win was the ability to stay mentally tough despite adversity. \"Today, I felt the calmest I\u2019ve ever felt on a major Sunday,\" Garcia said after the round, per Sobel . \"Even after a couple of bogeys, I was still positive. I still believed.\" The eventual winner also discussed the back-and-forth battle between Rose and him. \"We are good friends. We wanted to win,\" he explained, per My Golf Daily's Ron Mintz . \"We wanted to beat each other, but we did not want one of us to lose it.\" The friendly mindset was shared by Rose even after his disappointing defeat. \" If there's anyone to lose to it's Sergio,\" the runner-up told CBS, per Brian Wacker of Golf Digest . \"He's had his share of heartbreak.\" After so many close calls, Garcia will finally get a chance to celebrate a win in the biggest tournament of the year.

(Getty Images) \nUpdated at 10:51  51 p.m. ET \nTo do something no one has ever done is impressive, but to do something no professional team has ever done, or any college team, or any other player for that matter is flat out ridiculous. \nBut that\u2019s just what high school sophomore Tommy Hansen of Roncalli, Ind., did Friday against Metamora Township, Ill. \nHansen hit grand slams in three consecutive at-bats in a 12-1 victory. Only three other players in high school history have ever hit three in a single game, but none had ever done it in consecutive at-bats. \nOnly a few MLB players have ever hit two grand slams in a game with Fernando Tatis being the only one to do it in the same inning, and only one team in MLB history has been able to hit three in one game, which the Yankees did in 2011. \nAnd did we mention the fact Hansen is only a sophomore? \nAfter hitting no home runs as a freshman, he has hit five in his first six games as a sophomore, obviously with three of those coming in one game. \n\"When you get into that rhythm and you\u2019ve already gotten a few hits and barreled a few up, it comes easier,\" Hansen said, via the Indianapolis Star . \"You know how to do it.\" \nHe apparently knows how to do it well because he actually nearly hit one in his final at-bat the game before. He came up with the bases loaded in the seventh inning and doubled off the wall. \nSeems like the young man is locked in. \nHansen is not currently on any major prospect lists, but after this showing it would be hard to believe he won't make it on one soon.

After all, the running back market has been weak in the NFL this year, and the Falcons already have Tevin Coleman in place if Freeman were to walk after his contract expires following the 2017 season. \nBut the Falcons sound like they\u2019re willing to pay Freeman something substantially more than the $1.8 million he\u2019s due in 2017. Which would allow them to keep another important piece of the 2017 NFC champions in place.

He also said that the former member of 3 MB would be in trouble if he were under USADA administered drug testing. In case you didn\u2019t know... \nThis picture highlights the change in Mahal\u2019s physique over five years. Wow... \nNeedless to say, suspicions have been aroused. The heart of the matter \nDave Meltzer was astonished by the change in Jinder Mahal\u2019s physique. He pointed out that the Canadian Superstar\u2019s traps had grown exponentially in a very short period of time. The editor of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter also mentioned that the former member of 3MB had acne on his back, which is a classic symptom of steroid use. \nMeltzer concluded by saying that Mahal would be in big trouble if he were to be drug tested by USADA. What\u2019s next? \nDave Meltzer\u2019s comments have only added fuel to the rumours that pervade the internet. While WWE\u2019s wellness policy is not as thorough as USADA\u2019s drug tests, they could come knocking with a cup in hand if they have reason to doubt Jinder Mahal. Author\u2019s take \nWhile there is merit to Dave Meltzer\u2019s observation, it is unfair to accuse someone of taking steroids unless they fail a drug test. However, the miraculous change in Jinder Mahal\u2019s physique makes it easy for people to point fingers at him. Truth be told, we wouldn\u2019t mind going on his fitness regime. \nSend us news tips at fightclub@sportskeeda.com Recommended", "ord_in_thread": 0, "title": "WWE Rumors: If Jinder Mahal were under USADA, he\u2019d be in big trouble", "external_links": [], "entities": {"organizations": [], "locations": [], "persons": []}, "crawled": "2017-04-10T16:35:20.325+03:00", "published": "2017-04-10T16:35:20.325+03:00"}, {"url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRTzq7iQ9m468sH2pTy4Neo8kQIA2_AfkJG1D.kGKLT7hl.VKUSKgV1Fn4KzKT0AWgrua6Zqe5o0FGi_4OMMECshygCSb0gw9DChp0PpNdTJdcI_8gROndq0RrvJrJAMpI-", "uuid": "00f69456db43c46a5fcc8e0124ca5236cd003dfb", "thread": {"country": "EU", "spam_score": 0.205, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRTzq7iQ9m468sH2pTy4Neo8kQIA2_AfkJG1D.kGKLT7hl.VKUSKgV1Fn4KzKT0AWgrua6Zqe5o0FGi_4OMMECshygCSb0gw9DChp0PpNdTJdcI_8gROndq0RrvJrJAMpI-", "uuid": "00f69456db43c46a5fcc8e0124ca5236cd003dfb", "title_full": "WATCH: Verstappen\u2019s amazing opening lap in China", "replies_count": 0, "site_section": "", "site": "formula1.com", "performance_score": 9, "site_full": "www.formula1.com", "site_type": "news", "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 2}, "facebook": {"likes": 964, "shares": 964, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 3}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 28}}, "participants_count": 0, "site_categories": ["sports", "education"], "section_title": "", "title": "WATCH: Verstappen\u2019s amazing opening lap in China", "domain_rank": 5222, "main_image": "/content/fom-website/en/latest/features/2017/4/watch--verstappens-amazing-opening-lap-in-china/_jcr_content/image16x9.img.1536.high.jpg", "published": "2017-04-10T08:00:00.000+03:00"}, "highlightText": "", "rating": null, "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "author": "", "text": "AUTO AUTO S SD HD Fullscreen \nHaving fallen at the Q1 hurdle in qualifying after his Red Bull was struck by software gremlins, Max Verstappen was no doubt delighted to see wet conditions arrive as expected on race day. But even with his proven treaded-tyre credentials , not even he expected to make up quite so many places on a damp (if not fully wet) opening lap in Shanghai. \nLooking at the video above, you can see that the young Dutchman cannily selected second gear for the start - a bold, wheelspin-limiting decision that enabled him to rocket away from his P16 grid slot. \nOnce underway, Verstappen picked off Carlos Sainz\u2019s struggling slick-shod Toro Rosso almost immediately, and followed that up with passes on Kevin Magnussen\u2019s Haas, Marcus Ericsson\u2019s Sauber and McLaren's Stoffel Vandoorne to be P13 through the opening two turns. \nSergio Perez\u2019s Force India was then dispatched around the outside through Turn 4 before the 19-year-old raced past Lance Stroll\u2019s Williams under braking for Turn 6 to take tenth. \nShowing an incredible confidence that belied the tricky conditions, Verstappen then used a wider line through Turn 8 to snatch P9 from no less a driver than Fernando Alonso, before sending one up the inside of the similarly experienced Felipe Massa into Turn 11 to take eighth. \nThe astonishing nine-place opening lap climb was then completed when Nico Hulkenberg\u2019s Renault peeled into the pits, gifting Verstappen another place. \n\u201cIn the wet it\u2019s easier to overtake,\u201d F1's youngest ever winner said nonchalantly afterwards. \u201cI think it was a perfect race for me because then after [conditions improve] you go on the slick tyres, and you have passed most of the field already and you are basically back in the position where you should be.\u201d \nAnd if not for the damp conditions at the start, where might he have finished? \n\u201cWell, not third, for sure. Maybe sixth? [They were] good conditions for me\u2026\u201d \nFor more onboard videos from Shanghai, including several unseen angles, stay tuned to Formula1.com on Tuesday.

On Sunday, he picked up his 42nd triple double of the season, breaking Oscar Robertson\u2019s record that stood untouched for more than 50 years. Two days earlier, he solidified his double-digit assist averages for the year, joining Robertson as the only player in NBA history to average a triple double for an entire season . In the same game, he also joined The Big O and Nate \u201cTiny\u201d Archibald as the only players to average 30 points and 10 assists for a season. In all, Westbrook\u2019s posted eight triple doubles in his last 10 games. But for a player having the incredible season he\u2019s having, there seems to be indecision among voters penning in the NBA\u2019s Most Valuable Player of the Year award. Voters point to James Harden , who has helped orchestrate a Rockets \u2019 offense gunning its way to the West\u2019s third-best record. They point to Kawhi Leonard , whose two-way play has the Spurs affixed into the conference\u2019s No. 2 seed. And they look at LeBron James , as they do every season, leading his team to an anticipated third straight NBA Finals appearance. None of those players are having the season Westbrook has had. And if his season-long campaign to drag the Oklahoma City Thunder into the playoffs wasn\u2019t enough, his play in recent weeks served as a stark reminder not to leave The Brodie off of your MVP ballot this year. In his last 10 games, Westbrook is averaging 37 points, 12.6 rebounds and 11.1 assists. The latter stretch of his season has been a microcosm of one of the greatest individual seasons in NBA history. March 22 vs. Philadelphia Westbrook finished with 18 points (on six-of-six shooting from both the field and the foul line), 11 rebounds and 14 assists. He posted the first-ever perfect-shooting triple double in NBA history. His response? Congrats to @russwest44 on his big night! Westbrook picks up his 35th triple-double AND makes NBA history shooting 100% tonight! #ThunderUp pic.twitter.com/dWYfWluGDL \u2014 FOX Sports Oklahoma (@FOXSportsOK) March 23, 2017 March 29 vs. Orlando Westbrook scored 57 points in a win over the Orlando Magic , hitting a game-tying triple to send the game into overtime. It was the most points ever scored by a player to post a triple double in NBA history. He scored 19 fourth quarter points to erase a 10-point Orlando lead with under eight minutes left in the quarter. The possession before, he made one of the most difficult layups look like poetry in motion. April 4 vs. Milwaukee Westbrook finished with 12 points (on four-of-12 shooting), 13 rebounds and 13 assists to lead the Thunder to a three-point win over the Bucks . Despite his minimal points total, he recorded his seventh consecutive triple double, tying Michael Jordan for the most consecutive triple doubles in NBA history. It was the second time Westbrook tied Jordan\u2019s mark this season. April 7 vs. Suns Westbrook fell short of a triple double, finishing with 23 points, 12 rebounds and eight assists. Phoenix even intentionally fouled him down the stretch to prevent the two dimes that would have earned him the record. There it is! \u2014 NBA (@NBA) April 8, 2017 But it was his sixth assist in the third quarter against the Suns that solidified his season average of a triple double. It was during this game Westbrook officially joined The Big O as the only player to average one for an entire season. He also officially joined Robertson and Tiny Archibald as the only players to ever average 30 points and 10 assists. April 9 vs. Denver Westbrook went ahead and broke the record for his 42nd triple double of the season, the most ever in league history. He found Semaj Christon for a corner three-pointer that etched both of their names into the record books. Westbrook then turned around and erased a 10-point deficit, scoring 18 of the Thunder\u2019s final 21 points and nailing a game-winning, buzzer-beating three-pointer that both won the game for Oklahoma City and knocked the Denver Nuggets out of playoff contention. If that\u2019s not MVP basketball, I don't know what is.

It\u2019s proven a jarring drop for the champions, without doubt. \nThat being said, though, just what is the reason behind Leicester\u2019s fall from grace? Well, perhaps one of the most common diagnoses would be N\u2019Golo Kante or, rather, a lack of N\u2019Golo Kante. SIGN UP NOW \nWant to become a GMS writer?

Moreover, he hasn\u2019t wasted time settling down in west London, aiding the Blues\u2019 title surge to an incomprehensible degree. Article continues below Jamie Redknapp\u2019s reaction to hearing Fellaini is Man Utd captain is incredible \nThe bottom line is that the Frenchman played so well last season and so well this season that his absence is no minor matter. Consequently, it does beg the question \u2013 what if Kante had stayed at Leicester? \nWould the Foxes\u2019 fortunes have faired better and would they even retain their title? Of course, we\u2019ll never know for sure but one FIFA 17 YouTuber has taken us as close as we\u2019ll ever get to the answer. \nVia the medium of FIFA 17 career mode, the user \u2018BMOnus\u2019 ensured that Kante stayed put and proceeded to simulate the 2016-17 season to see how things would pan out. The results make for interesting reading. Overall success \nIn the Premier League, Leicester retained their Champions League status with a solid fourth place finish. Consequently, the presence of Kante was worth no less than seven positions in the table. \nThat being said, this regarded a season in which Arsenal won the title for the first time since 2004. Oh how Arsene Wenger would wish that to be true. \nChelsea seemed to suffer without the 26-year-old as well. While they did successfully usurp Leicester, they had to settle for second place and not the comfortable top-of-the-table lead they currently possess. \nBizarrely, however, Kante\u2019s presence seemed to have a negative impact on Leicester\u2019s lucrative Champions League campaign. Claudio Ranieri\u2019s men were knocked out by Real Madrid in the round of 16 and by an aggregate scoreline of 5-1 at that. \nWithout their midfield maestro in real life though, the Foxes have clambered their way into the quarterfinals with Sevilla being put to the sword. \nThe entire video can be seen below: \nIf FIFA 17\u2019s simulations can be trusted, just one player can in fact have a great bearing on the fortunes of an entire club. Those who worried for Leicester after selling Kante seem, via video game hindsight, to have been proven correct. Future \nFor all the YouTube videos and imagination in the world, though, Leicester fans can\u2019t bring Kante back. The 26-year-old looks on course for a second Premier League title in as many years, too. \nIn fact, the Frenchman has even emerged as something of a frontrunner for the PFA Player of the Year award. It would prove a phenomenal achievement given his often overlooked and underplayed position. \nAmid their revival under Craig Shakespeare, Leicester are no longer stuck reminiscing but are looking up once again. \nKante would have been a valuable asset to their title defence yet six wins in six games shows they can do the business without him. Besides, lets no forget the contributions of Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez in a hurry. \nWhere do you think Leicester City would have finished if N'Golo Kante never left?

As it got to about 9.25am, when the class was about to begin, I decided I was into the routine and I would just stick with it.\u201d Read More Horrifying pictures of little boy who was left with bleeding lump on his head after 'school bully pushed him into metal pole' \nVicki, whose partner Dave Parr, 35, is an investment banker, joined a gym after the birth of her youngest son Noah, now four. \nAs her fitness improved, she saw a post on Facebook about the fire service and decided to join up. Vicki had a four operation to have titanium rods placed in her back (Photo: PA Real Life) \nShe officially became a firefighter in January last year at Birchwood Fire station and as one of just 32 female firefighters in Cheshire, she has been working to encourage more women to join up. \nHer intense job meant she needed to stay fit and strong, so she went to the gym every day. \nOn this occasion, though, one of her regular routines went drastically wrong. \nVicki, also a mum to Luke, 10, said: \u201cI was doing step-ups on an aerobic step and I had a bar on the back of my neck, carrying 130kg, which is about 20 stone. Vicki with her children Noah and Luke, on holiday in Majorca last year (Photo: PA Real Life) \n\u201cI stepped up with my right leg and left leg and got straight back down, but I wobbled and because of the weight of the bar, I fell forwards rather than backwards. \n\u201cIt basically folded me in half. It\u2019s like leaning down and touching your toes and someone coming and shoving you that extra little bit further.\u201d \nThe bar rolled down Vicki\u2019s neck and over her head and she was flung backwards onto the floor, screaming in pain. \nShe added: \u201cThe next thing I remember is another gym goer next to me telling me to stay still. I kept trying to get up and they were telling me to stay where I was. \n\u201cIt felt like I\u2019d been laid on cold concrete for so long my body was numb. I didn\u2019t understand what I had done.\u201d Vicki Williams at the gym working out last autumn (Photo: PA Real Life) \nStaff called the paramedics and they arrived within 15 minutes and when they started to treat her, they realised how serious Vicki\u2019s injuries were \n\u201cThe paramedics came and said they needed to move my legs and when they did, I thought my feet were still on the floor, but they had moved me. I knew something was very wrong,\u201d Vicki said. \n\u201cThe only thing I could think of was that I wouldn\u2019t be able to go to a training weekend at fire college. I was really looking forward to it. It sounds ridiculous right now but I didn\u2019t even think I was never going to walk again.\u201d \nRushed to Aintree hospital, she was given strong painkillers, including ketamine, and taken straight for CT and MRI scans, to assess the damage to her back. \n\u201cThe surgeon told my family and that it was really bad. They said they needed to get me into surgery straight away,\u201d she explained. \nDuring a four-hour operation, doctors placed titanium rods in her back, but a dislocated bone had damaged her spinal cord. \nVicki remained in intensive care for 11 days, before being moved to a spinal ward. Vicki Griffith's colleagues at Birchwood Fire Station in Cheshire (Photo: PA Real Life) \nLast week, she was moved to Southport spinal injuries rehabilitation unit to continue her recovery. \nHer injuries mean she is unable to move from her belly button down and doctors are still assessing her and she is undergoing rehab but they believe it is unlikely she will be able to walk again. \nShe said: \u201cThings could change. Your body is still in shock for the first eight weeks. I will be tested again after the eight weeks and there is a slim chance that with intense physio and a lot of work, I may be able to walk. \nVicki and her partner, Dave, are in the process of buying their first home together and friends and family have set up a JustGiving page, to raise money to make adjustments for Vicki in their new home.

But we need to be able to make more long term adjustments at the new house, to make it more wheelchair-friendly, to help me get around.\u201d \nAnd she has set herself the target of May 28 to return to her rented house. \n\u201cI think it will take some work, but I am very determined. They had said the end of June but I think I can do it by the end of May. \n\u201cLuke has been staying with his dad who is helping him understand and my family have been great with helping to look after Noah. \n\u201cI have had so much support from everyone, especially my family and Dave, so I know I can get there.\u201d \nA spokesperson from LiveWire, who operate the gym at Birchwood, said: \u201cWe wish Victoria all the best in her recovery.\u201d \nTo donate to Vicki\u2019s page, visit https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/vicki-peers-3-peaks Like us on Facebook", "ord_in_thread": 0, "title": "Mother-of-two is left paralysed after her back folded in two and SNAPPED while weightlifting at gym", "external_links": [], "entities": {"organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "pa real life"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "warrington"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "aintree university hospital"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "birchwood leisure"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "birchwood fire station"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "instagram"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "facebook"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "southport"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "majorca"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cheshire"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "birchwood"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "liverpool"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "aintree"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "vicki"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "vicki williams"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "vicki griffith"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dave"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "noah"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "luke"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "victoria griffiths"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dave parr"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-10T10:59:04.797+03:00", "published": "2017-04-10T10:59:04.797+03:00"}, {"url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.4snjSUV.tkGFD_3yflZe4iefbuk5WNBuukLFAC9XTDkK0IEKA3s.Uv37bmJ3Gt9KsIdX26YY0PE_toVjoTGtBEM96pfJ0hfoovSG7Qh.C1Q--", "uuid": "8cbcaf33f341abe1b3c6622ab84513467d777b4a", "thread": {"country": "IE", "spam_score": 0.0, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.4snjSUV.tkGFD_3yflZe4iefbuk5WNBuukLFAC9XTDkK0IEKA3s.Uv37bmJ3Gt9KsIdX26YY0PE_toVjoTGtBEM96pfJ0hfoovSG7Qh.C1Q--", "uuid": "8cbcaf33f341abe1b3c6622ab84513467d777b4a", "title_full": "Cheryl makes a VERY public statement about the \"love bubble\" she shares with Liam Payne and their baby son", "replies_count": 0, "site_section": "http://www.irishmirror.ie/rss.xml", "site": "mirror.co.uk", "performance_score": 9, "site_full": "www.mirror.co.uk", "site_type": "news", "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 998, "shares": 998, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}}, "participants_count": 1, "site_categories": ["news", "entertainment", "sports"], "section_title": "irishmirror - Home", "title": "Cheryl makes a VERY public statement about the \"love bubble\" she shares with Liam Payne and their baby son", "domain_rank": 804, "main_image": "http://i4.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article9184834.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/Cheryl-Ann-Fernandez-Versini.jpg", "published": "2017-04-11T14:57:48.668+03:00"}, "highlightText": "", "rating": null, "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "author": "Jessica Gibb", "text": "Cheryl makes a VERY public statement about the \"love bubble\" she shares with Liam Payne and their baby son Liam Payne's girlfriend has shared her joy at becoming a mother with fans Share They want their baby out of the spotlight (Photo: Getty/Instagram) Share Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!

Article continues below \nNow, there\u2019s a huge rumour floating around as to why this match was moved to the pre-show. PUNISHMENT? \nThe Inquisitr is reporting that this could have been a form of punishment for Ambrose, based on his antics two nights earlier at the WWE Hall of Fame ceremony. \nIt\u2019s common knowledge that there\u2019s an open bar at these sort of events, and fans of Total Divas will certainly be aware of the fact that Ambrose loves a good ol\u2019 drink and it seems as if he showed it in his interview on the red carpet. \nHe struggled to get some of his words out, while he also made some comments that real-life girlfriend Renee Young had to brush off as well. \nApparently, him appearing to be drunk on camera when talking to Renee rubbed WWE officials the wrong way, but you have to assume that it wasn\u2019t massively serious as they kept the championship on him. \nIf they were really mad, there\u2019s no way Ambrose would have left the Grandest Stage of Them All with the Intercontinental title. \nWas he drunk? Or is that the sort of mannerisms we\u2019re used to seeing with Ambrose on WWE television? It could be either, and it\u2019s important to remember that this is just a rumour, but it wouldn\u2019t be a major surprise if this was a form of punishment from officials. \nThere\u2019s no denying that both men looked visibly upset when walking down the ramp, and you probably would be too if you found out at the last minute that you\u2019re being demoted to the pre-show after months of build-up to their clash. \nWhy do you think Dean Ambrose vs. Baron Corbin was moved to the WrestleMania 33 pre-show?

Russell Westbrook of the Oklahoma City Thunder (Getty Images) Sacha Pisani \nUpdated at 11:19 p.m. ET \nUpdated at 11:19 p.m. ET \nAfter breaking a 55-year-old NBA record, Oscar Robertson believes Oklahoma City Thunder guard Russell Westbrook can go on and make more history. \nIt was a landmark day in the NBA as Westbrook set the record for the most triple-doubles in a regular season with his 42nd against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday. Westbrook posted 50 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists \u2014 including the game-winning buzzer-beater \u2014 in the thrilling 106-105 win as he surpassed the Basketball Hall of Famer. \nThe six-time All-Star, who is averaging a triple-double for the season, also has 79 career triple-doubles as he continues to make waves, despite losing star team-mate Kevin Durant to the Golden State Warriors. And Robertson expressed his admiration for Westbrook post-match, the 78-year-old and 1971 champion lauding his impact on the NBA. \n\"I could not be happier for him. Congratulations to Russell Westbrook on a magnificent season,\" Robertson wrote for the Undefeated . \"Westbrook's averages are similar to mine in both scoring and assists [a point higher in scoring, a digit lower in assists]. What's more, he leads the league in scoring by a comfortable margin at 31.9 points per game.\" \n\"If he stays healthy, there's no reason he couldn't eventually break my career record of 181 triple-double games.

Following his second-round loss to UFC light heavyweight champion Daniel Cormier , \u201cRumble\u201d shocked the MMA world by announcing that he had decided to hang up his gloves at the age of 33 in order to pursue another venture in his life. And while Johnson remained cryptic about what exactly that venture was at Saturday\u2019s UFC 210 post-fight press conference, he did elaborate on the reasons that led him to walk away while still in the prime of a lucrative fighting career. \u201cIt\u2019s just business,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI want to do something besides going to the gym everyday punching and kicking and rolling around with another dude. That sh*t gets old. I\u2019ve been doing this for so long, I\u2019ve been in sports since I was 8, it\u2019s just time to move on to something different. I won\u2019t say better, but just different. \u201cAnd no, I am not about to play football for the (Los Angeles) Rams,\u201d Johnson added, referencing the many Rams tributes that adorned his Twitter profile. \u201cBecause everybody\u2019s hitting me up and saying some crazy stuff about (how) I\u2019m about to play for the Rams. Why would I go into another sport that\u2019s the same thing as this, and you take all this impact and stuff? That\u2019s absolutely insane.\u201d Johnson (22-6) said his commitment to retire from MMA was not an impromptu decision. He revealed that it was something he had been planning since last year, even before his UFC 206 fight against Cormier fell through due to an injury suffered by the champion. Regardless of how things played out at UFC 210, Johnson said he already resolved to retire, win or lose, and he spent all of fight week in Buffalo with the knowledge that his rematch against Cormier would be the final fight of his career. \u201cI was just soaking it all in,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut no matter what, I was going to go out there and do my best. I hadn\u2019t checked out or anything, but I knew what I needed to do regardless. And of course, I\u2019m an athlete. I\u2019ve always been an athlete, so I wanted to go out on top. It\u2019s been a fun ride. Honestly, it leaves you kind of speechless. You just don\u2019t know what to say, really. \u201cEvery fight to me was a career highlight. I\u2019ve just had so much fun, from my very first fight in the UFC until now.\u201d Johnson exits the sport as one of the most feared power punchers in all of the UFC and an unquestioned top-three fighter in the light heavyweight division. But nonetheless, he still leaves on a low note, having fallen to Cormier for a second time in three years, this time quicker than the last. To make matters tougher, Johnson puzzled many observers by fighting Saturday\u2019s rematch at UFC 210 with a grinding, grappling-heavy approach, choosing to wrestle with the two-time Olympic wrestler rather than focus on his own striking prowess. Johnson admitted afterward that whatever his initial game plan was, things \u201ckind of fell off track\u201d as the fight wore on. \u201cI felt great,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI trained my butt off to fight Daniel. You still saw \u2018Rumble\u2019 out there trying to knock heads off and going out there and give it his all. So, I went out there and did my thing, and whatever happened was going to happen, so I wasn\u2019t really worried about anything. \u201cThe game plan was to win. Keep my composure, control the pace and things like that. And just in the middle of the fight, I just kind of fell off track and started playing his game, which was wrestling and things like that. I felt fine. I felt great. It wasn\u2019t like I was tired. He beat me. I don\u2019t take anything away from him.\u201d Johnson now calls an end to a roller-coaster UFC career that began in 2007 with a 13-second knockout of Chad Reiner. Johnson was still a welterweight back in those early days, and though he found some success at 170 pounds, he ultimately struggled to make the weight consistently and exited the UFC in 2012 after failing to meet the middleweight limit in his 185-pound debut. However, \u201cRumble\u201d reinvented himself like few fighters have, blowing up into a monstrous power puncher in the light heavyweight and heavyweight divisions and winning 12 of his last 14 fights, highlighted by first-round knockouts of Alexander Gustafsson , Ryan Bader , Glover Teixeira , and Antonio Rogerio Nogueira in his second UFC run. And when asked on Saturday how he\u2019d like fans to remember him, Johnson was frank. \u201cJust a guy who went out there and went all out and just never gave up,\u201d he said. \u201cEven when I was down and was getting stepped on and kicked and things like that, I still kept going. I didn\u2019t win all of my fights, obviously, but I went out there and did my best, and I think people appreciated what I did for them and what they saw in me out there. I hope that I made a lot of people happy and excited to see me fight. Not many people can go through hell and back like I did and still rise to the top. I didn\u2019t win a title, but I was still knocking at that door. \u201cThe toughest fight I can possibly think of was always with myself,\u201d Johnson added. \u201cThat\u2019s just what it is. That\u2019s everybody\u2019s fight. You always battle yourself and not the opponent.\u201d Johnson also acknowledged the one fight that got away, expressing remorse over having never gotten the chance to test himself against troubled ex-UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones , who was in attendance at UFC 210 on Saturday night. \u201cI\u2019m an alpha male, he\u2019s an alpha male. I wanted to see what I can do against him,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure he wanted to see what he could do against me, because you guys hyped it up so much, that I was supposed to be the guy to beat him and all this and that. You guys do your job very well, hyping things up, so props to you. \u201cBut I feel I\u2019m more, I don\u2019t know if I want to say sad (or) disappointed, for the fans, because I know they really wanted to see it. Day in and day out, people were always talking about Jon Jones and myself fighting each other, and it just never happened. Maybe if I decide to come back one day, we can fight at heavyweight or something like that.\u201d Latest From Our Partners", "ord_in_thread": 0, "title": "\u2018Rumble\u2019 Johnson vaguely explains stunning UFC retirement: \u2018It\u2019s just business\u2019", "external_links": [], "entities": {"organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "ufc"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "mma"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "los angeles"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "buffalo"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "anthony johnson"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "esther lin"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "johnson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "alexander gustafsson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "glover teixeira"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "jon jones"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "antonio rogerio nogueira"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "chad reiner"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ryan bader"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cormier"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "daniel cormier"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "daniel"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-09T16:35:05.978+03:00", "published": "2017-04-09T16:35:05.978+03:00"}, {"url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRTzq7iQ9m468sH2pTy4Neo8kQIA2_AfkJG1D.kGKLT7hl.VKUSKgV1FuFhfruOvJ5ijzdxstQE3rI4nzv_T_Z8Xfwro4aZ.YlRu2z1UwtiJJC8kWWu06UKmx0sWY6fdSs-", "uuid": "5185dc18bb69f4ddf5bd1aea0a968afa06fdd197", "thread": {"country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.003, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZRTzq7iQ9m468sH2pTy4Neo8kQIA2_AfkJG1D.kGKLT7hl.VKUSKgV1FuFhfruOvJ5ijzdxstQE3rI4nzv_T_Z8Xfwro4aZ.YlRu2z1UwtiJJC8kWWu06UKmx0sWY6fdSs-", "uuid": "5185dc18bb69f4ddf5bd1aea0a968afa06fdd197", "title_full": "What the teams said - race day in Shanghai", "replies_count": 0, "site_section": "", "site": "formula1.com", "performance_score": 9, "site_full": "www.formula1.com", "site_type": "news", "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 984, "shares": 984, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}}, "participants_count": 0, "site_categories": ["sports", "education"], "section_title": "", "title": "What the teams said - race day in Shanghai", "domain_rank": 5222, "main_image": "/content/fom-website/en/latest/features/2017/4/what-the-teams-said---race-day-in-shanghai/_jcr_content/image16x9.img.1536.high.jpg", "published": "2017-04-09T08:00:00.000+03:00"}, "highlightText": "", "rating": null, "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "author": "", "text": "Info Close Sauber \nGiovinazzi followed up his qualifying crash by repeating his endeavours and hitting the opposite wall on the pit lane, ending his race and bringing out the safety car. In the rookie's defence, it did look to be caused by aquaplaning. Ericsson ran wide in the tricky conditions, and never had the pace to trouble the other midfield runners. He propped up the field in 15th. \nMarcus Ericsson, 15th \n\u201cI had a good start as well as a decent first lap. During the virtual safety car phase we were changing to soft tyres, even though we knew that the track was partly dry as well as still wet. After that, it was quite difficult. The conditions were tricky as well as the asphalt temperatures being relatively low, which made it difficult to get the tyres to work. Overall, I struggled with the tyres during the whole race \u2013 I never really got them into the right working window. Now I look forward to Bahrain.\u201d \nAntonio Giovinazzi, DNF \n\u201cFirst of all, I want to apologize again to the team. They did a great job to get the car ready for the race. It was a shame that I crashed again today. A learning lesson \u2013 I just want to forget this weekend quickly.\u201d \nMonisha Kaltenborn, Team Principal \n\u201cToday it was not our day \u2013 especially not for Antonio. We are glad that he is fine after the accident. The conditions were difficult, even more so without having much experience. For Marcus the race was also not easy, as we were just not able to keep up with the pace of the competitors \u2013 this race showed the weaknesses of our car. Now we focus on the next race weekend in Bahrain in one week.\u201d Next Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 Marcus Ericsson (SWE) Sauber C36 at Formula One World Championship, Rd2, Chinese Grand Prix, Race, Shanghai, China, Sunday 9 April 2017. \u00a9 Sutton Motorsport Images Antonio Giovinazzi (ITA) Sauber on the drivers parade at Formula One World Championship, Rd2, Chinese Grand Prix, Race, Shanghai, China, Sunday 9 April 2017. \u00a9 Sutton Motorsport Images Info Close McLaren \nAlonso once again seemed to out-perform his car, running in the points and keeping some faster drivers at bay by being the 'quickest in the corners.' Unfortunately his race was cut short with drive shaft issues. Vandoorne likewise didn't see the chequered flag after pulling into the garage with a fuel pressure problem. \nFernando Alonso, DNF \n\u201cWe started from P13 in very tricky conditions, and after a few laps we were running in sixth position. That was a big surprise and was thanks to an amazing couple of laps. I was hoping those tricky conditions would continue as other cars were spinning off here and there, and, as we said yesterday, we maximised our opportunities as we were overtaking \u2018for free\u2019 at some moments. \u201cBut then, when the track started drying out, we started to lose a little bit of ground even though we were still able to hold onto P7 for some time. \n\u201cToday we proved once more how hungry we are to get a good result, but unfortunately we\u2019re still not strong enough to finish the races. The lack of winter testing means we\u2019re paying a big price now, but hopefully we can improve quickly. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that neither Stoffel or I could not get to the end today, and especially painful because I was in the points, but all we can do is learn our lessons and be a little bit better in Bahrain, even though the forecast is of course for no rain\u2026\u201d \nStoffel Vandoorne, DNF \n\u201cIt was a short race for me, but quite exciting at the beginning. Both Fernando and I got good starts, and were in the mix for the first few laps, although the positioning wasn\u2019t great after the pit-stops, and then after that it was a bit more tricky, but our pace was actually quite promising. When we put the slicks on, we were actually quite competitive and I was able to push when I wanted to. The car feels very good in the corners \u2013 I felt very confident and I was closing the gap to the guys in front \u2013 but as soon as it started to get drier, we really noticed the difference in speed and it made it very difficult to overtake. With the straight-line speed we have, we can\u2019t really compete with the others and it\u2019s tough out there for us to make up ground. \n\u201cOn lap 17 we lost power \u2013 I don\u2019t really know exactly the reason \u2013 but I think it was a fuel problem. It\u2019s a shame we couldn\u2019t get to the finish today \u2013 the potential was there and the car felt quite competitive in the corners compared to the cars I was racing against. I felt the power drop and I could feel immediately we had very low power. It\u2019s not ideal, and obviously I would have liked to go to the end. \n\u201cThere\u2019s not been many laps for me in China, but this is the situation we\u2019re in at the moment. We knew that before coming here and hopefully next weekend in Bahrain it will be better. There are still positives we can take away: the chassis is coming along, and both Fernando and I are feeling very confident to push. I hope it will get better soon \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to put a time-frame on it so we\u2019ll have to wait and see. Bahrain is a very different kind of circuit from Shanghai, and we\u2019ll do our best as usual.\u201d \nEric Boullier, Racing Director \n\u201cOn a damp and slippery track, Fernando judged his getaway perfectly to make a superb start from his P13 grid slot, and was in eighth place by the time of the first virtual Safety Car just a few laps into the race. By lap seven he was up to sixth, and he duly began a highly entertaining dice with his fellow countryman Carlos [Sainz]. \n\u201cStoffel had also made a bit of progress by that time, having moved up from his P16 grid slot to a solid P15, and was capably holding station with the cars around him. \n\u201cUnfortunately, those promising beginnings were soon to come to naught, when a fuel problem ended Stoffel\u2019s race after only 17 laps and a driveshaft issue put paid to Fernando\u2019s afternoon after just 33. \n\u201cFrom here we travel straight to Bahrain, one of our three home Grands Prix, Silverstone and Suzuka being the other two, where we hope to enjoy a better, and warmer, weekend\u2019s racing.\u201d \nYusuke Hasegawa, Honda R&D Co. Ltd Head of F1 Project & Executive Chief Engineer \n\u201cDespite the result today, I think we can take away multiple positives from this weekend. \n\u201cIt was very tricky race conditions, yet the team did a great job as always and managed the pit-stop strategy perfectly. Fernando had an excellent start, making up multiple positions off the line, and I think he was having a very good race up until his retirement. Stoffel also made a good start and was racing well before his day sadly ended early. \n\u201cAt one point it looked like we were on our way to scoring some points, which makes it all the more disappointing that both drivers ended up retiring with mechanical issues. \u201cIn spite of that, we leave Shanghai with certain progress of our PU reliability after both the Australian and Chinese Grands Prix. \n\u201cWe\u2019re now looking forward to Bahrain next weekend, where hopefully we can continue to build on our momentum. It\u2019s only a few days away so we don\u2019t have long to prepare, but we\u2019ll work hard with McLaren to hopefully push for a better result.\u201d Next Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 Nico Hulkenberg (GER) Renault Sport F1 Team RS17 and Stoffel Vandoorne (BEL) McLaren MCL32 at Formula One World Championship, Rd2, Chinese Grand Prix, Race, Shanghai, China, Sunday 9 April 2017. \u00a9 Sutton Motorsport Images Fernando Alonso (ESP) McLaren MCL32 at Formula One World Championship, Rd2, Chinese Grand Prix, Race, Shanghai, China, Sunday 9 April 2017. \u00a9 Sutton Motorsport Images Info Close Force India \nSome thought Perez fortunate not to be penalised for his incident with Stroll at the start, but after that drove an intelligent race which included a clean pass on his team mate to grab ninth. Ocon followed him home in the final points paying position, a decent result on a track which hadn't looked to suit the VJM10. \nSergio Perez, 9th \n\u201cIt feels great to come away from an entertaining race with some more points. The start of the race was not easy because I made a very poor start and lost five or six places before turn one. As soon as I dropped the clutch, I went into wheel spin. I recovered some places during lap one, but then there was contact with Stroll in turn ten, which gave me a puncture. I don\u2019t think he saw me on the inside because he didn\u2019t give me any space. We definitely made the switch to dry tyres at the right moment and choosing the supersoft was the correct decision because I found a good rhythm straight away and overtook Massa and Kvyat. You can always look back on the strategy and see things you could have done better, but I think we finished where we deserved in terms of car pace. It\u2019s another great result for the whole team and our twelfth consecutive race in the points, which is a special achievement.\u201d \nEsteban Ocon, 10th \n\u201cFinishing the race in the top ten is a good recovery, but I still feel I could have been a couple of places higher up. We had the correct strategy and started the race on the right tyre, but on lap two there was a misunderstanding with the team and I drove all the way down the pit lane without stopping for tyres. I was not supposed to come in and it cost me at least 15 seconds. It was a result of the confusion of those early laps, when everyone was diving into the pits. It\u2019s a shame to lose time like this, but in the end we scored a point and that\u2019s a positive. The car felt quite good today and finishing in tenth shows we can make a good improvement on Sundays. Next week we race in Bahrain and, unlike Melbourne and Shanghai, it\u2019s a track I know well and where I\u2019ve had success in the past. I got pole in GP3 in 2015 so I have good memories from there. I am looking forward to racing there and adding to those memories.\u201d \nRobert Fernley, Deputy Team Principal \n\u201cThe first few laps were fairly hectic, but as things settled down the team managed the race extremely well to earn another double points finish. Sergio and Esteban both delivered mature drives, especially in the tricky damp conditions early on. Their varied strategies worked well, although with hindsight there were possible opportunities that would have allowed both cars to finish higher up. Both drivers enjoyed some close wheel-to-wheel racing and managed their pace when it mattered. All in all it\u2019s another solid result and we can be happy about scoring more important points at this early stage of the year.\u201d Next Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 Esteban Ocon (FRA) Force India VJM10 and Sergio Perez (MEX) Force India VJM10 battle for position at Formula One World Championship, Rd2, Chinese Grand Prix, Race, Shanghai, China, Sunday 9 April 2017. \u00a9 Sutton Motorsport Images Esteban Ocon (FRA) Force India VJM10 makes a pitstop at Formula One World Championship, Rd2, Chinese Grand Prix, Race, Shanghai, China, Sunday 9 April 2017. \u00a9 Sutton Motorsport Images Info Close Toro Rosso \nSainz was the only driver to gamble on starting on slicks. It didn't look a good choice after a spin left him last at the end of the first lap, but helped by the drying conditions and the safety car, he clawed his way back into contention and even gave the big teams a scare with his lap times. He only had to pit once and so was able to score decent points for Toro Rosso. Kvyat was unlucky - a good start had looked likely to yield points for the Russian, but he had to retire mid-race with a suspected hydraulic issue. \nCarlos Sainz, 7th \n\u201cWOW! What a race, I just don\u2019t have words to describe it! On the grid I said I wanted to start the race on slick tyres and everyone thought I was completely mad! It sounds like a funny moment now, but when everyone took the blankets off the tyres and my race engineer told me that we were the only ones the supersoft tyre I doubted my decision\u2026 When you\u2019re on the grid, about to start a race, and you take a tough decision like today\u2019s, there\u2019s a lot of weight on your shoulders, knowing that you might have blown away a good result for the team\u2026 but I then said to myself, c\u2019mon trust yourself, it\u2019s the right thing to do! I knew the start and the first four corners were going to be very tricky \u2013 and they certainly were! \u2013 but from Turn 6 onwards the track was fully dry and I felt confident \u2013 the gamble definitely paid off! But today\u2019s result isn\u2019t only thanks to this decision; it\u2019s also down to the pace that we showed in damp conditions. After the Safety Car, I saw myself catching Ferrari, Red Bull and Mercedes in front and I got super excited! It was just an incredible race, I felt so comfortable in the car today and to finally cross the line in P7 is a great result \u2013 I\u2019d like to thank the team for the whole weekend, we can all be very happy!\u201d \nDaniil Kvyat, DNF \n\u201cWhat a shame, we had a hydraulic failure which still needs to be investigated and therefore had to stop the car. Just before that, we were struggling a bit on the Soft tyre and it was a bit hard to keep them up to temperature\u2026 So we were an easy target for everyone who was on Supersofts. It wasn\u2019t being the easiest of races, that\u2019s for sure! On the positive side, we\u2019ve shown the performance is there and that we can be strong going forward. We just need to make sure we grab the points when the opportunities arise. In general I\u2019m quite happy, it\u2019s just a shame we had a bit of bad luck today but these things happen and we just have to accept them\u2026 it\u2019s part of this sport! We\u2019re working well as a team \u2013 and this makes me feel very confident - we have the pace and I look forward to next week\u2019s race weekend in Bahrain where we will come back stronger!\u201d \nFranz Tost, Team Principal \n\u201cWe saw a very interesting and exciting race today. First of all, I\u2019d like to congratulate Carlos for his very risky decision \u2013 he was the only car with dry tyres on the starting grid! He drove a fantastic race and crossed the line in P7. Without the Safety Cars, I think he would\u2019ve achieved an even better result\u2026 he certainly would have deserved it! It was great to see how he was fighting with the front runners. Regarding Daniil, he got off to a very solid start and was also able to fight for positions but unfortunately his car had a hydraulic problem. This is something that must not happen when you want to fight for a good position in the Constructors\u2019 Championship. Nevertheless, we have a competitive package and I\u2019m positive that we can also score many points in the next races - this is what we will go for with big determination.\u201d Next Previous Enlarge 1 / 2 Carlos Sainz (ESP) Scuderia Toro Rosso STR12 runs wide and spins at Formula One World Championship, Rd2, Chinese Grand Prix, Race, Shanghai, China, Sunday 9 April 2017. \u00a9 Sutton Motorsport Images Carlos Sainz (ESP) Scuderia Toro Rosso STR12 and Daniil Kvyat (RUS) Scuderia Toro Rosso STR12 at Formula One World Championship, Rd2, Chinese Grand Prix, Race, Shanghai, China, Sunday 9 April 2017. \u00a9 Sutton Motorsport Images Info Close Haas \nMagnussen drove his best race for a while, keeping out of trouble and overtaking Perez to bag some decent points. Grosjean had a harder time from the back of the grid, but did demonstrate some very decent pace to keep Verstappen behind and avoid being lapped by the Dutchman - much to the latter's annoyance... \nRomain Grosjean, 11th \n\u201cYesterday was a bit of a joke and today the same guy crashed in front of me on the straight line, so I had to stop. I lost a lot of time. Then (Marcus) Ericsson at the restart left miles ahead of the car in front of me. I don\u2019t know what he was doing, so I was already on the back foot. (Esteban) Ocon pushed me on the first lap. I lost half of the right-hand side of the car. From there I just pushed as hard as I could. I couldn\u2019t really find an opening on (Jolyon) Palmer. Once I did, though, I had some good lap times. We were doing a decent job, but it was already too late. It was not easy on strategy. The guys did the best job they could. We saw the checkered flag and the lap times were looking decent. I think we had more, but it\u2019s time to look forward to the next race and, hopefully, it\u2019s going to get better.\u201d \nKevin Magnussen, 8th \n\u201cIt was a good race. I had fun out there. I had a good car all the way through the race. I\u2019d made a really poor start, so to come back from that and push, I was really happy. The car\u2019s been good today. I was able to look after the front tires, which I think was key, along with working with the team to get the car in the right window. The race was really well managed from the team. It was good strategy to get me out on the supersoft after the intermediates. You had to fight for it, in terms of passing. It\u2019s not easy, but you also have grip, so you can take different lines and get close in alternative ways. It\u2019s so much more fun when you\u2019re fighting in the points. I\u2019m happy for the team and we\u2019re looking forward to the coming races.\u201d \nGuenther Steiner, Team Principal \n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see Kevin\u2019s team scoring their first points since the start of Haas F1 Team. For Kevin to score points on his second race is fantastic. I think Romain had a challenging weekend. In Australia it was Kevin\u2019s turn to have a challenging weekend and here it was Romain, though he wasn\u2019t lucky in Australia either. Again, I think we showed what we can do and that we are what we think we are. We just have to do it consistently. We can then look to a good season in front of us. Both drivers drove a fantastic race. I think we did more overtaking between the Haas team than the rest of the teams. I\u2019m very proud of that, and we put on a good show. For sure, the weather played a role today, but with the different strategies applied, overtaking is possible. It\u2019s still difficult \u2013 that was proved with Romain trying to get around (Jolyon) Palmer \u2013 he made sure he was wide, but then Romain got by. It just got better from then onward. The flight home will feel a lot shorter with points in the bag.

Palmer was never able to make in-roads after starting at the back, whereas what had looked promising for Hulkenberg after a good start soon unravelled. He was unlucky in the safety car period, pitting at the wrong moment to fall down the field. He then picked up two time penalties for overtaking both under the virtual safety car and the real one. \nNico Hulkenberg, 12th \n\u201cWe took a risk right at the end of the first lap and came in for slicks as the track was really dry everywhere apart from the main straight. As I exited the box though, Stroll crashed and the Virtual Safety Car came out, and in damp conditions if you can\u2019t push, you lose all the tyre temperature. I lost all grip; it was like driving on ice and I spun a few times\u2026 From there it just went wrong, the VSC pretty much ruined our strategy and so the race. It\u2019s a shame because I think it could have worked out very nicely for us today.\u201d \nJolyon Palmer, 13th \n\u201cIt was a difficult race. We made the right call to pit at the end of the formation lap but I hit a wet patch when racing a Toro Rosso, then the tyres lost temperature under the Virtual Safety Car, so it was a very difficult first stint. On the plus side, the car ran reliably and I have a race distance under my belt now. Now we reset and head to Bahrain with the objective of a much better weekend.\u201d \nCyril Abiteboul, Managing Director \n\u201cUltimately, this has been a frustrating weekend for us. We showed strong potential with our P7 on Saturday, however the race did not deliver the results we wanted. The early Virtual Safety Car meant we were immediately on the back foot as we\u2019d already pitted Nico to cover the threat from those behind. He then also received a penalty. Jolyon suffered from the same Virtual Safety Car affecting his strategy and after that we were on damage limitation. We are disappointed to end the second Grand Prix with no points, however the positives are that we showed both pace and reliability here.

the NBA playoffs, and that seemed like a forgone conclusion when Cleveland held a 26-point lead heading into the fourth quarter against the Atlanta Hawks. \nBut the Hawks would mount a furious comeback, erasing the seemingly insurmountable deficit en route to a 126-125 overtime victory at Philips Arena. \nYou can see the highlights from the epic rally in the video below.

However, Cleveland\u2019s opponents in those last two games certainly provide optimism for the Celtics. \nSunday marked the first of a back-to-back for the Cavs, as they will travel to Miami for a Monday night matchup with the Heat. Miami has given Cleveland trouble this season, as it has won two of the three contests between the two teams this season. \nThe Cavaliers will then finish their regular season Wednesday night when they host the Toronto Raptors. The Raptors have been one of the powerhouses in the East this season, as they currently are just 1.5-games behind both Cleveland and Boston. \nIf Boston has any hope of claiming the No. 1 seed, it must earn victories in its final two games of the regular season. Both contests will take place at TD Garden, as they\u2019ll host the Brooklyn Nets on Monday, followed by a Wednesday night showdown with the Milwaukee Bucks. \nThe Celtics aren\u2019t expected to have too much trouble with the lowly Nets, but the Bucks have given Boston trouble throughout the regular season. \nWith major playoff positioning at hand, these final few days of the NBA regular season are sure to be exciting. \nThumbnail photo via Brett Davis/USA TODAY Sports Images ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "title": "Hawks\u2019 Epic Comeback Win Over Cavs Keeps Celtics\u2019 No. 1 Seed Hopes Alive | NBA | NESN.com", "external_links": [], "entities": {"organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "nba"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "cleveland cavaliers"}, {"sentiment": "negative", "name": "epic comeback win over cavs keeps celtics"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "raptors"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "atlanta hawks"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "toronto raptors"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "celtics"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "boston celtics"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "milwaukee bucks"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "philips arena"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cavaliers"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cavs"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "hawks"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "brooklyn nets"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "miami"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "td garden"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "east"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "cleveland"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "atlanta"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "boston"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "adam london"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "brett davis/usa"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-10T12:37:08.555+03:00", "published": "2017-04-10T07:17:00.000+03:00"}, {"url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.jqmG9d5TL0CNosokxbTj3a4CBr8Ti7YCOawH1K_yEr54g8d0LLW.jjyyVEJjsg3p90CcF_j01.OpWCNkA09OXa0NBUqWscnoYYCdPjKBSgM4sy9DYdHCy", "uuid": "ed460aed6e4aeca9a92e1054316e0820d74ccad4", "thread": {"country": "FR", "spam_score": 0.08, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.jqmG9d5TL0CNosokxbTj3a4CBr8Ti7YCOawH1K_yEr54g8d0LLW.jjyyVEJjsg3p90CcF_j01.OpWCNkA09OXa0NBUqWscnoYYCdPjKBSgM4sy9DYdHCy", "uuid": "ed460aed6e4aeca9a92e1054316e0820d74ccad4", "title_full": "Russian arrested in Spain possibly linked to US election hacking - France 24", "replies_count": 0, "site_section": "", "site": "france24.com", "performance_score": 9, "site_full": "www.france24.com", "site_type": "news", "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 990, "shares": 990, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 2}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 7}}, "participants_count": 0, "site_categories": ["news", "sports"], "section_title": "", "title": "Russian arrested in Spain possibly linked to US election hacking - France 24", "domain_rank": 5515, "main_image": "http://scd.france24.com/en/files/imagecache/home_1024/article/image/10042017_spanish_police.jpg", "published": "2017-04-10T15:10:33.555+03:00"}, "highlightText": "", "rating": null, "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "author": "Text", "text": "Text by NEWS WIRES Latest update : 2017-04-10 An alleged Russian hacker has been detained in Spain at the request of American authorities, an arrest that set cybersecurity circles abuzz after a Russian broadcaster raised the possibility it was linked to the U.S. presidential election. \nPyotr Levashov was arrested Friday in Barcelona on a U.S. computer crimes warrant, according to a spokeswoman for Spain's National Court, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with court rules. \nSuch arrests aren't unusual - American authorities typically try to nab Russian cybercrime suspects abroad because of the difficulty involved in extraditing them from Russia - but Levashov's arrest drew immediate attention after his wife told a Russia's RT broadcaster he was linked to America's 2016 election hacking. \nRT quoted Maria Levashova as saying that armed police stormed into their apartment in Barcelona overnight, keeping her and her friend locked in a room for two hours while they quizzed Levashov. She said that when she spoke to her husband on the phone from the police station, he told her he was told that he had created a computer virus that was \"linked to Trump's election win .\" \nLevashova didn't elaborate, and the exact nature of the allegations weren't immediately clear.

I\u2019m just going to say that, if I could count inanimate structures as friends, then Joe Louis Arena would be my second-oldest friend. \nMy relationship with the Joe goes back past my kids, past my wife, past quite a few friendships and girlfriends, back past the time when I started working for my Dad at the Anchor Bar, and back to a point where I hadn\u2019t quite figured out what I was going to do with my life. Going to hockey games at the Joe was the thing that I did while I was figuring everything else out, and that\u2019s really made the Joe an inseparable part of my life story. I\u2019m having a hard time figuring out how to let it go. \nFans packed Joe Louis Arena during the Red Wings\u2019 streak of making the postseason for 25 consecutive seasons. Fans brought with them from Olympia the traditional throwing of the octopi during the Stanley Cup playoffs. (Photo: Jarrad Henderson/Detroit Free Press) \nThe best way I can describe the way it feels for me to go to a game at the Joe is to compare it to that scene in Goodfellas, where Ray Liotta walks into the Copacabana through a secret entrance, into the kitchen and right out onto the floor. I don\u2019t get the super special celebrity treatment, but going to a game for me is more about saying hello to a bunch of good friends than it is about any individual game. \nThat\u2019s a really strange thing to say, because every time I go over (strangely, that\u2019s how regulars talk about going to the game \u2013 never, \u201cAre you going to the game tonight?\u201d, but, \u201cHey \u2013 you going over?\u201d), I spend probably half the game walking around and talking to people, and the other half waiting in line for the bathroom. \nRead more coverage on the end of Joe Louis Arena: Thank you, Joe Louis Arena; It has been a sweet, smelly ride \nI realize that that\u2019s an incredibly lucky way to feel about going to games. I know that every single game, there\u2019s some family that\u2019s walking past Gordie\u2019s statue for the very first time. Every single game, there\u2019s some kid that looks at those steps, and wonders if they can make it all the way to the top. \nBut for me, going over is like a trip to the corner bar. \n(Photo: HEATHER ROUSSEAU/Special to the Free Press) \nIt\u2019s a gradual thing, really. When I started working at the Anchor (which is, in honesty, the absolute best hockey bar in the entire world), I was more of a Tigers guy. Hockey was the thing that paid the bills, but baseball was where my heart lay. It starts really small \u2013 someone\u2019s got an extra ticket to the game, so you go over with them. \nThen, you learn about the secret meeting spot. Just behind Section 126, where the beer guy knows to stop as he\u2019s walking into the stands. Someone slips you a pass to the Olympia Room. Someone tells you that they\u2019ve got some extra suite tickets for the next game. \nAll of a sudden, you\u2019re hooked. You know Orange Hat Guy and the old lady who knits, and you can sing the words to the Curly Shuffle. The games just kind of blur together. They aren\u2019t the reason you\u2019re at the Joe, they\u2019re the excuse you use to hang out with your best friends. \nDetroit Red Wings fans watch as players arrive at Joe Louis Arena for the season opener against the Ottawa Senators on Oct. 17, 2016. (Photo: Nate Smallwood, Detroit Free Press) \nThe Joe has always been an awkward place to love. It\u2019s a riverfront arena where you can\u2019t see the river. It\u2019s a place where the bathrooms have never \u2013 not once \u2013 made sense in a way that an actual human can understand. Everything about it, from the luxury suites, to the Olympia Room, to the press box, just feels like it was thrown together at the last second. To me, though, that was what made loving it so special. \nReally, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to make it hard to move on from Joe Louis. Sure \u2013 it\u2019s just a building (and not even a magnificent one, at that). Professionally, I think that my Dad and I have done the things we need to so that we\u2019re ready for Little Caesar\u2019s Arena. We\u2019ve bought two more buses, and we\u2019re trying really hard to become basketball fans so that we can talk about the Pistons with all of our new customers. \nThe crazy quirks and the insane tricks that you learned as you went to games, over and over again through the years \u2013 that\u2019s what made the place magical. That\u2019s what I\u2019m really going to miss. I never got to ride the Zamboni with Al. I never got to shoot Score-O. I\u2019ve never thrown an octopus on the ice (there\u2019s still time!). I\u2019ve been lucky, though. I got to have Joe Louis Arena as my corner bar for just about twenty years. Those are some big shoes for the Little Caesar's Arena to fill. \nIf I'm lucky, I\u2019ll be writing this same column again in another thirty-some years. \nVaughn Derdarian and his family are the owners of Detroit's Anchor Bar.

That got us reminiscing about our favorite and/or most memorable moments that took place at 19 Steve Yzerman Drive since the arena opened in December 1979. Here are some of the most notable ... J. Kyle Keener, Detroit Free Press Fullscreen Buy Photo Feb. 5, 1980: Gordie Howe, Wayne Gretzky cross paths. Gordie Howe was pushing 52 years of age. Wayne Gretzky had just turned 19. Both were on the ice for the 32nd NHL All-Star Game at Joe Louis Arena, the only time the All-Star Game made its way to the Joe. Free Press file photo Fullscreen Buy Photo May 16, 1996: Steve Yzerman's greatest goal. Fresh off their first Stanley Cup finals appearance in almost 30 years, the Red Wings entered the 1996 postseason with an NHL-record 62 regular-season wins. But they were locked in a sudden-death Game 7 against the St. Louis Blues, in a scoreless tie. Just minutes into double-overtime, he stole the puck from the Blues' Wayne Gretzky and drilled the game-winner past goalie Jon Casey from the blue line. JULIAN H. GONZALEZ, DETROIT FREE PRESS Fullscreen Buy Photo Dec. 26, 1996: Sergei Fedorov beats Capitals by himself. Fedorov gave Red Wings fans quite a Christmas present, even though it was a day late: He scored all five Red Wings goals in a 5-4 overtime victory over the Washington Capitals. Though the five-goal game has been accomplished 60 times in NHL history, only two other NHL players have scored five goals in a game since Fedorov did it 20 years ago: The Minnesota Wild's Marian Gaborik in 2007 and the Red Wings' Johan Franzen in 2011. MARY SCHROEDER, Detroit Free Press Fullscreen March 26, 1997: The \"Brawl in Hockeytown\" is the signature moment of the bloody Red Wings-Avalanche rivalry that lasted for about a decade, between two teams that each won multiple Stanley Cups. The bad blood began in the 1996 Western Conference Finals, when Claude Lemieux of the Avalanche checked the Wings' Kris Draper into the boards, stoking the ire of Draper's teammates (Dino Cicarelli: \"I can't believe I shook this guy's friggin' hand\"). Though the two teams played three other times without any major fights the following season, this game was different, resulting in nine (!) brawls, including the infamous Lemieux-Darren McCarty duel. TOM PIDGEON, Associated Press Fullscreen Buy Photo June 7, 1997: The 42-year Cup drought is over. Finally. After 42 years without a championship - a period that included the \"Dead Wings\" era - Steve Yzerman and the Red Wings completed a 4-game sweep of the Philadelphia Flyers with a 2-1 victory in Game 4. They celebrated the Stanley Cup with their hometown fans. Mary Schroeder, Detroit Free Press Fullscreen Buy Photo Detroit Red Wings player Brendan Shanahan lifts the Stanley Cup over his head after Detroit defeated the Philadelphia Flyers in four games to win the championship at Joe Louis Arena in downtown Detroit on June 7, 1997. Mary Schroeder, Detroit Free Press Fullscreen Buy Photo Oct. 8, 1997: With heavy hearts, Red Wings raise banner. It was as emotional of a night as ever at The Joe. To start the 1997-98 season, the Red Wings hang their first championship banner since 1955. The fans explode when Gordie Howe and Ted Lindsay hand the Stanley Cup to Steve Yzerman. The Captain famously tells Mr. Hockey: \u201cThanks for coming.\u201d Julian H. Gonzalez, DFP Fullscreen Buy Photo Then, the fans tear up when the spouses of Vladimir Konstantinov and Sergie Mnatsakanov \u2013 Wings still hospitalized with permanent injuries from a June limousine accident after the team\u2019s private party to celebrate the Cup \u2013 receive flowers at center ice from fellow Russians Slava Fetisov, Igor Larionov and Slava Kozlov. Kirthmon F. Dozier, Detroit Free Press Fullscreen Buy Photo The Wings donned \u201cBelieve\u201d patches that they would wear all of the 1997-98 season en route to their back-to-back Cups, the last NHL team to capture consecutive Cups. JULIAN H. GONZALEZ, DETROIT FREE PRESS Fullscreen Buy Photo April 1, 1998: The goalie fight. A little more than one year after the infamous Red Wings-Avalanche brawl, the two teams scuffled yet again. It seemed like any other hockey dust-up ... until Avalanche goalie Patrick Roy challenged Wings goalie Chris Osgood to a fight near mid-ice. The Joe was rocking as the two goalies squared off. JULIAN H. GONZALEZ, DETROIT FREE PRESS Fullscreen Buy Photo Oct. 16, 1998: Wings raise another banner. The Red Wings won another Stanley Cup, the last NHL team to win back-to-back championships. As \u201cBad to the Bone\u201d plays on the Joe Louis Arena speakers, Vladimir Konstantinov, pushed in a wheelchair by Sergei Fedorov, receives a thunderous ovation. But the biggest ovations went to The Captain and The Coach. Scotty Bowman, officially, was on a leave of absence to start the season, after a heart procedure and a knee replacement during the summer. Julian H. Gonzalez, DFP Fullscreen Buy Photo May 31, 2002: Red Wings destroy Avalanche in Game 7. Once again, the Red Wings and Avalanche were deadlocked in another gritty Western Conference playoff series. But Game 7 of this one, for a chance to play in the Stanley Cup finals, was no contest. That's because the Red Wings battered Avs star goalie Patrick Roy with six (!) goals in two periods, then rookie Pavel Datsyuk added a seventh in the third period on back-up David Aebischer when the game was all but over, leading to a 7-0 Game 7 victory. Julian H. Gonzalez, Detroit Free Press Fullscreen Buy Photo June 13, 2002: The 'Hockey Gods' win the Cup. Though the Red Wings won four Stanley Cups during the Joe Louis Arena era, the 2002 team was considered their most talented of the four. They had one of the greatest coaches of all time in Hall-of-Famer Scotty Bowman and 9 Hall-of-Fame players, including Steve Yzerman, Sergei Fedorov, Igor Larionov, Nicklas Lidstrom, Luc Robitaille, Brett Hull, Brendan Shanahan, Chris Chelios and Dominik Hasek. Pavel Datsyuk, an eventual Hall of Fame candidate, also was on the team as a rookie. Kirthmon F. Dozier, Detroit Free Press Fullscreen Buy Photo The team went on to win the Central Division. Then it won the President's Trophy. Then it won the Western Conference ... and it culminated in Game 5, when the Wings beat the Carolina Hurricanes 3-1 at The Joe to win their third Stanley Cup in six seasons. J Kyle Keener, Detroit Free Press Fullscreen Buy Photo Nov. 21, 2005: Jiri Fischer collapses. In one of the scariest moments in Joe Louis Arena history, 25-year-old Red Wings defenseman Jiri Fischer collapsed on the bench due to a cardiac arrest during a game against the Nashville Predators. He was unconscious for six minutes before being resuscitated by the Wings' medical team, saving his life. Julian H. Gonzalez, Detroit Free Press Fullscreen Buy Photo The game was postponed due to the incident, marking the first time an NHL game was halted due to a medical incident. Though Fischer was released from the hospital two days later, he eventually had to retire. General manager Ken Holland hired him into the Wings' front office, where he currently serves as director of player development. KIRTHMON F. DOZIER, Detroit Free Press Fullscreen Buy Photo Jan. 2, 2007: Yzerman's No. 19 heads to the rafters. Though the Red Wings couldn't win a Stanley Cup in Steve Yzerman's final season -- 2005-06, when they won the Presidents' Trophy -- they honored their longtime Captain with a ceremony he'll never forget before a game against the Anaheim Ducks (a 2-1 Wings win, by the way). WILLIAM ARCHIE, Detroit Free Press Fullscreen Buy Photo Steve Yzerman, fittingly, spent 19 seasons as the Wings\u2019 captain, the longest tenure in NHL history. The banner bearing his name and number, fittingly, includes a \u201cC\u201d in the right corner. He scored 692 goals and tallied 1,063 assists in his NHL career. JULIAN H. GONZALEZ, Detroit Free Press Fullscreen March 6, 2014: Lidstrom's No. 5 heads to the rafters. Seven years after \"The Captain\" joined the rafters at The Joe, it was \"The Perfect Human\"'s turn. Nicklas Lidstrom retired following the 2011-12 season, capping a sparkling Red Wings career that included four Stanley Cups, seven Norris Trophies as the league's top defenseman and a Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoff MVP in 2008. Duane Burleson, AP Fullscreen Buy Photo Two years later -- delayed due to the NHL's lockout-shortened 2012-13 season -- Lidstrom's No. 5 went up to the rafters at Joe Louis Arena. Diane Weiss, Detroit Free Press Fullscreen June 14, 2016: The Gordie Howe visitation. It was a fitting tribute to the man we know as \"Mr. Hockey.\" Gordie Howe, the longtime Red Wings legend who touches hockey fans across many generations, passed away June 10 of this year. And though he never played at The Joe as a Red Wing, his visitation took place there, allowing fans young and old to pay tribute to one of the greatest hockey players who ever lived. Bill Pugliano, Getty Images About 15,000 people attended the 12-hour visitation, according to the Red Wings. Scotty Bowman, Wayne Gretzky and Al Kaline attended as pallbearers. And it was an amazing way for fans to say goodbye to one of the best. Eric Seals Like this topic?

Last year in Baltimore we started attacking a little bit more and I had my best year, so it\u2019s going to be exciting.\u201d \nAmong the other things Jernigan has noticed about the Eagles already is the presence of Fletcher Cox at defensive tackle. Opposing offenses pay a lot of attention to Cox as well, something that should give Jernigan chances to win one-on-one battles over the course of the season. \nJernigan is set to be a free agent after the 2017 season, something he said he\u2019s not thinking about at this point but winning those battles should pay off with a nice new deal in Philly or somewhere else by the time April 2018 rolls around.

the Selangor government and Paws Animal Welfare Association (PAWS).\nThrough Paws, the state will be giving a RM100 subsidy for dogs and RM60 for cats neutered at registered vet clinics across Selangor, in a bid to increase awareness of responsible pet ownership among pet owners.\n\n\u201cWe have gotten the approval for RM150,000 and we are now working out the final kinks before we can implement this new programme,\u201d said Paws shelter manager Edward Lim.\n\nPaws, who will also be the project\u2019s facilitator is expecting this programme to kick off some time by end of April.\n\nTo qualify for this subsidy, pet owners or animal rescuers must be Selangor born citizen and all neutering must only be done at vets in the state.\n\u201cThis project is strictly for Selangor born only and as much as we want to make this available for everyone, we cannot provide 100% and just do as best we can with the funds,\u201d he said.\n\nLim further explained that this funding is from the Selangor government and it is only appropriate if the money goes back to Selangor born residents.\nHowever, he hopes that other states will follow suit and implement this neutering subsidy programme to help reduce strays on the streets.\nFor a start, Lim is expecting to subsidise neutering for about 1,500 cats and dogs with the funds and will apply for more once the initial RM150,000 runs out.\n\n\u201cWe are hoping that this will not be a one off project and that it will be carried on for five or 10 years to come.\n\u201cIt is impossible to expect the number of strays to decrease overnight from neutering as this is more of a five to 10 year project,\u201d he said.\nOnce launched, a claim form will be made available on their website for download and those interested to get the subsidy will have to submit a photocopy of their MyKad.\n\nAlso to ensure that the claim is genuine, applicants will have to submit a before and after photo of the cat or dog with the neutering surgical wound.\nThe vet who performed the surgery will also have to sign an acknowledgement in the claim form and the original receipt will also be needed.\n\u201cWe will only allow a grace period of two weeks from the date of receipt for owners and rescuers to submit the claim form,\u201d he said.\n\nCurrently, Paws is still working out the money disbursement methods with the state.\nPaws has previously been informed that the money will only be released once the necessary paperwork is submitted to them.\nHowever, Lim argued that this process is tedious and will take too long as it might take three to four months before applicants get their subsidy.\n\n\u201cWe cannot expect animal rescuers who neuter five to 10 strays a week to wait three to four months for their money.\n\u201cThis process should be more effective and we believe that the money should be released immediately for this programme to work better,\u201d he said, adding that talks are still ongoing and should be finalised soon.\nApart from encouraging people to neuter their animals and strays, this programme is also to educate pet owners on the importance and benefits of neutering.\n\n\u201cSome people might think that this is a cruel act but what is more cruel, letting them reproduce and either end up being roadkill or abused by people who find them a nuisance or stop them from reproducing unnecessarily,\u201d he said adding that this is a project which has been proven effective.\nIn fact, this whole model and idea was drawn from Animal Care, a charitable organisation which raises funds to help animal rescuers carry out neutering since eight years ago.\n\n\u201cI cannot say that the stray population has decreased for the whole of Malaysia but I can say that its working for those of us who do neutering in our respective neighbourhoods.\n\n\u201cOnce I neutered six cats and took care of them on the street at my previous home and for as long as we lived there, no other new cats came so yes it does work,\u201d said its founder Dr Chan Kah Yein when contacted.\nSince they started in May 2009, Chan has disbursed over RM86,000 to animal rescuers to carry out neutering for 6,301 animals and 2,218 medical treatments nationwide.\n\nChan added that the main reason why the stray population is increasing especially at public places like markets or on the street, is due to irresponsible dumping by pet owners.\n\nTheir pets which are not neutered will continue reproducing and this vicious cycle will never end.\n\u201cNeutering really needs to be emphasised and encouraged, or even made compulsory for pet owners,\u201d she added.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "title": "Selangor's neuter programme to begin this month - Community | The Star Online", "external_links":

player by a considerable margin (Photo: Getty Images Europe) Share Get football   \nManchester City's defenders don\u2019t need telling how good David Silva is - their failure to lay a hand on him in training is evidence enough. \nAccording to Fabian Delph, the Spanish star - who made his 300th appearance for the club at the weekend - has his own ball at the training ground because no one can get it off him. \nAnd the midfielder believes that makes Silva the best in English football by far. \n\u201cI have played against David and been at the club for almost two years. I do like to tackle and press, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve tackled him in two years,\u201d Delph explained. \n\u201cHe is phenomenal, and a great guy on and off the pitch - for me he\u2019s the best player in the Premier League by a country mile and him getting his 300th appearance is amazing.

The Spaniard has often captained City this term (Photo: Stu Forster) \n\u201cI can\u2019t put my finger on why that is,\u201d the midfielder said of the lack of awards. \u201cFootball is about opinions, and that is mine, and maybe a few others. \n\u201cBut it\u2019s surprising that he is not in the team of the year every single season as he is a dream to play with and to have around the place. \n\u201cHe is 30, 31 now, and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he played another 200-300 games. He seems to be very fit, very strong, recovers very well - a very professional guy.\u201d Delph has played both with and against the Spaniard (Photo: Getty) Read More Pep Guardiola needs big summer shake up according to Alan Shearer \nDelph would love to get even half the game time Silva enjoys, and after finally coming in from the Etihad cold and appearing in City\u2019s last two games, he believes his patience and hard work could yet be rewarded. \n\u201cI\u2019m a really positive person and all through my life and career I have been a hard worker and a believer that hard work will get repaid,\u201d he explained. \n\u201cThere isn\u2019t a day I have not worked hard and in the last couple of games the manager has repaid me. I had the opportunity to play two games and have done OK in both. \n\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating not to be playing but you have to keep going. It\u2019s an unbelievable squad, where everyone is very talented.

(Photo: Comedy Central) CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nOn Tuesday night, \"Detroiters\" concludes its first season on Comedy Central with an episode that exemplifies its winning strategy: Embrace the ridiculous and the Detroit-specific. \nJason Sudeikis is returning for the main story line. It involves his Chrysler marketing executive character, who was last seen in the hospital after being accidentally run down by Sam and Tim, dragged into the woods and left unconscious with a Better Made potato chip bag shoved over his head. \nIn the subplot, Rick Mahorn, the Detroit Pistons basketball star from the Bad Boys era, guests as a car dealer. As Quick Rick Mahorn from Dearborn, he appears in a spoof of one of the best-known TV commercials in Detroit history, the Mel Farr, Superstar ads that featured the late Detroit Lions running back as a flying, red-caped character. \nRead more: 'Detroiters' takes on Dream Cruise, brings on 'SNL' stars \n\"My parents were killed in an alley, so I became a superhero who can run fast,\" says Mahorn in the parody. \nHow goofy, how pure Motor City. No wonder \"Detroiters\" was able to break the Detroit-filmed TV series curse \u2014 the one that means shows set here and made here never get a chance at a second season. \nFor a decade now, the curse has persisted. A network pilot shot in 2008 for an automotive family drama, \"The Prince of the Motor City,\" wasn't picked up to series. Two other shows made it through one season: ABC's \"Detroit 1-8-7\" in 2010-11 and AMC's \"Low Winter Sun\" in 2013. Both were sincere attempts to co-opt Detroit's grittiness, but they left critics and viewers lukewarm. \n\"Detroiters\" creators and stars Sam Richardson and Tim Robinson have reversed the course. Their 30-minute comedy, renewed in March, is now in the writing process for season two. The production will film new episodes here this summer that are expected to debut in early 2108. \nSam Richardson and Tim Robinson of 'Detroiters.' (Photo: Dave Krieger) \nHow did they succeed where others failed? Some of the credit goes to the D, the city that Comedy Central President Kent Alterman says adds a huge element to \"Detroiters.\" \n\"There's so much character that comes through because Detroit has a lot of character,\" Alterman told the Free Press after the renewal was announced. \nThe ratings have been promising for a show that's a newcomer on a niche cable network. According to Comedy Central, \"Detroiters\" has averaged nearly 500,000 viewers per episode, a total that includes delayed viewing. As Alterman explained last month: \"The ratings pretty much doubled in terms of playback, from live in comparison to the playback numbers, and that's always a good sign that it's resonating for people.\" \nThe series has passed muster with hometown viewers. The metro Detroit region is the No. 1 market for \"Detroiters\" among the key advertising demographic of adults 18-49. The credit for that should go to Richardson, who's from Detroit, and Robinson, who's from Clarkston. \nThe two became close friends while working at the now-defunct Second City Detroit and Planet Ant in Hamtramck before scoring high-profile jobs elsewhere. (Richardson costars on HBO's \"Veep\"; Robertson became a \"Saturday Night Live\" featured player and writer.) They consider the show a love letter to Detroit and lace the scripts with authentic nods to local people, places, snack foods and trends. \nFor instance, they recently poked fun at the Detroit-themed T-shirt craze by introducing their version with the awkward slogan \"De2roiters\" \u2014 pronounced \"Dee-too-roiters\" (and not even a near miss). Among the topics they've mined for laughs: the influx of high-tech companies from other cities, the vowel-bending weirdness of the Michigan accent, an old political spat between Monica Conyers and Ken Cockrel Jr., the Woodward Dream Cruise. \nOne of the best running gags is the reinvention of former WDIV-TV (Channel 4) anchor Mort Crim. The dignified broadcast journalist plays a wild-card anchor who's seen on TV spouting wrap-ups of bizarre crime stories and teasing a segment called \"Chump of the Week.\" \nRichardson and Robinson's brand of smart-dumb humor also has clicked with the majority of TV critics. A New York Times review called their show \u201c 'Dumb and Dumber' meets 'Mad Men' \u2014 if Don Draper was wildly goofy and handled accounts for D.U.I. lawyers and hot-tub shops.\" Variety's review summed it up as \"a nice place to visit and stay awhile, to enjoy the world in a completely different headspace.\" \n\"Detroiters\" has an 87% positive average at the Rotten Tomatoes website, which aggregates reviews to determine its rating. \"That's a pretty good number. That's definitely in the upper tiers of premiering series,\" says Rotten Tomatoes editor-in-chief Matt Atchity. \"The critics have definitely responded to that show. They really like it.\" \nA score like that can help put a lesser-known show on people's radar, Atchity says. \"If we get someone to take a chance on the show and then they decide, 'Hey, I'm glad I checked this show out,' ultimately, that's a big part of why we're around.\" \nAllison Keene, senior editor and TV critic for Collider, is among those who like \"Detroiters.\" She says she was pleasantly surprised at its renewal. \"Not that it isn't great, but it's so hard to get noticed these days. It's so easy for a show like this to fly under the radar.\" \nA small gem like \"Detroiters\" is up against a glut of viewing choices. According to research done by FX, there were 409 original scripted television series in 2015 when you add up broadcast, cable and online streaming platforms. \n\"Detroiters\" packed a few attention-getting secret weapons, such as the star-studded friends and colleagues of Richardson and Robinson who dropped by for the first season. \nJason Sudeikis of 'Detroiters.' (Photo: Dave Krieger) \nBesides Mahorn and Sudeikis (who plays a recurring character and is also an executive producer), the list of guest stars includes Keegan-Michael Key, Cecily Strong and Michael Che of \"Saturday Night Live,\" rapper Trick Trick, pro wrestling great Kevin Nash, \"Tonight Show\" announcer Steve Higgins, Marc Evan Jackson of \"Brooklyn Nine-Nine,\" \"Home Improvement\" costar Richard Karn and Larry Joe Campbell of \"According to Jim.\" \nBut what resonated with critics was the bromance between Sam Duvet and Tim Cramblin, the longtime friends and partners in a struggling ad agency played by Richardson and Robinson. For all of their male obliviousness, Sam and Tim are actually quite progressive about their emotional bond as BFFs forever. \n\"It's really that brotherhood and friendship that Sam and Tim have on-screen and in real life,\" says Keene. \"It's so sweet. I think what stands out is that their characters actually love each other.\" \nKeene notes that there is also is a certain fatigue toward shows set in the location trifecta of New York, Los Angeles and Chicago (as in \"Chicago P.D.,\" \"Chicago Fire,\" \"Chicago Med,\" and \"Chicago Justice\"). \n\"('Detroiters') isn't afraid to be specific and to make a lot of references that people who live there would understand,\" says Keene, At the same time, \"there's sort of a truth about an urban center that Detroit gets right.\" \nLike \"Atlanta,\" the cutting-edge FX comedy with a much different mood, \"Detroiters\" counts on fans to roll with the localized content. Take last week's scene in which Tim's dad, Big Hank Cramblin (played by Kevin Nash), reeled off a litany of places that were either closed or repurposed: the Lindell AC eatery, Boblo Island, the Pontiac Silverdome and so on \n\"Even though I didn't get the references to the particular bars and restaurants, I got the point of it,\" says Keene. \nLocal cast member Andre Belue, who plays Cramblin-Duvet agency assistant Tommy Pencils, thinks \"Detroiters\" is helping to improve the city's image nationally. \n\"People are really excited to see a different aspect of Detroit when they hear these references of the city,\" says Belue, who works in marketing for Carhartt, the clothing company headquartered in Dearborn. \"It gets people more interested in something they (may have only) heard negatively about. They really haven't heard the story of the city revitalizing. I have friends calling me from out of state saying: 'I'm coming to get a coney dog. I want to see what this is all about.' \" \nThe local sprinkles, however, don't overwhelm the creative recipe. Detroit actress Shawntay Dalon, who plays Tim's wife and Sam's sister, credits much of the show's success to its writing and its ability to create relatable slices of life. \nThe episode about a big birthday party for Sam's dad, for example, had a character who baked a bunch of pies for the gathering. \"She reminded me of every cousin that comes to the family gathering and is like: 'My pies are the bomb.' You dare not speak against her pies in any way. It's things people can relate to,\" says Dalon with a laugh. \nThe thumbs-up response to \"Detroiters\" has been a relief, says Richardson during a brief break for a phone interview. \n\"You're working so hard on something, you're like, 'I hope I'm not the only one who likes it.' You're never sure if it's going to be well-received or if everybody is going to get the same things you were going for.\" \nRichardson counts the birthday party episode and Tuesday's finale as among his favorites. Both capture the blend of silliness and real feeling that has begun to define the series. \n\"We were kind of playing around with tone in the first season,\" says Richardson. \"I think moving forward, we're going to try to solidify that a little bit more.\" \nThis week, Richardson and Robinson attended a finale screening for the local cast and crew at the Madison Building in Detroit. Richardson said most of the first-season team is reuniting for the second. \"We're getting back as many people as we can that we haven't lost to Atlanta (a filming hub) or other jobs. They're like family. It's a really fun working set, so I think and I hope and am pretty sure they're excited about coming back.\" \nWhat about the big question. Will Mort Crim return for those deliciously absurd news clips? \n\"Mort Crim is in the script, so yes,\" says Richardson. \"Chump of the Week\" lives! \nContact Julie Hinds: 313-222-6427 or

agreed to visit the New York Times\u2019 basement on a spring afternoon. But, once he dug into the newspaper\u2019s archival photos of Canada, he was smitten, he said.\n\u201cIt was just fascinating to see the history of Canada unfold.\u201d\nBratty, a GTA real estate executive, ended up buying the Times\u2019 Canadian photo collection. In the coming months, he will donate the nearly-25,000 images to Ryerson University\u2019s photography collection. \n\u201cIt\u2019s an incredible improvement of our collection and an incredible resource for studying Canadian history,\u201d said Paul Roth, director of the Ryerson Image Centre.\n  The photos span nearly the entire 20th Century, from the years leading up to the First World War through the 1990s. \nEach frame captures a specific time and place in Canadian history, as seen through an American newspaper\u2019s lens. There\u2019s William Lyon Mackenzie King, the Avro Aero, Mary Pickford, Trudeaumania and so much more. \nBratty said he considered donating the images to the Art Gallery of Ontario or the National Gallery in Ottawa, but the idea of giving them to a university appealed to him. \n\u201cIt was very educational going through the photos (and) I thought there\u2019s got to be a way this can serve a purpose to inform,\u201d Bratty said. \u201cI thought, \u2018Give it to the university and let them expose young minds to it.\u2019\u201d\nOpened in 2012, the Ryerson Image Centre has, to date, been based primarily around the Black Star collection, over 290,000 black and white photos from the archives of New York-based Black Star photo agency. \nRoth called the collection an \u201cextraordinary resource,\u201d which has stocked the Ryerson Image Centre\u2019s exhibitions on everything from U.S. prohibition to the American Civil Rights movement. But Black Star falls a little short on its portrayal of Canada, Roth said.\n\u201cWe wanted a resource (of Canadian images) that would be equally strong and equally appealing to outside scholars,\u201d he added.\nThe Ryerson Image Centre will exhibit a selection of the New York Times photos from Sept. 13 to Dec. 10. After that, the images will be sorted and added to the Centre\u2019s permanent collection, where they can be viewed by appointment by any member of the public. \nTitled \u201cThe Faraway Nearby,\u201d it will delve into the \u201cspecial relationship between an American newspaper and (Canada), this big unruly subject which is too large for any one newspaper or certainly any one exhibition or book to cover,\u201d said Roth.\nA handful of Times shots will also be incorporated into the exterior design. \nCurrently, the building\u2019s fa\u00e7ade is adorned with Black Star portraits of non-Canadian luminaries like Muhammad Ali, John F. Kennedy and Gloria Steinem.\nThis spring, they will be replaced with Bratty-donated photos of Pierre Trudeau, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Marshall McLuhan and others \u2014 figures who, Roth said, \u201crepresent what we think of as the very best of Canadian life and history in the 20th century.\u201d\nBratty said the photos are a glimpse at all that Canada has to be proud of. \n\u201cWe never toot our own horn in Canada, and when you look at (the photos) you think it\u2019s probably un-Canadian to be anything but humble about what we\u2019ve accomplished,\u201d Bratty said. \u201cBut we should be proud of the stuff we\u2019ve done....

News 10 Apr 2017, 17:47 IST FIFA 17 will be followed with the launch of FIFA 18 in September 2017 What\u2019s the story? \nIt\u2019s definitely not a cake-walk to allot the correct ratings to a whole pool of players for FIFA 18. The current version of FIFA, FIFA 17, has around 700 clubs with more than 18000 players and the next instalment will for sure have as many players if not more. \nThus, in order to ensure that ratings are precise for each of them, EA will rely on a host of verticals, including primary guesswork, data collection and to top it off, statistical analysis. This entire process will take place under the careful guidance of Michael Mueller-Moehring, who is a producer with the company. In case you didn\u2019t know... \nFIFA 18 will be powered by the same engine as FIFA 17, but improvements for the gamers will come forth in the form of greater detail in terms of player movement and a sharper animation including the crowd details. The heart of the matter \nMichael Mueller-Moehring will head a team of 9000 data reviewers as a part of the setup for player ratings which will comprise scouts, coaches and season ticket-holders who will be expected to watch the maximum number of matches possible. \nPost this, they will have to provide a subjective evaluation of each of the players on a secure site. This feedback would then be collated into 300 different data fields alongside 35 specific attribute categories in order to determine the overall rating. \nAlso read: What to expect from FIFA 18 \nThe reasoning behind such an evaluation is the fact that one cannot rely on mere stats to infer a player\u2019s rating, it\u2019s more important to analyse their mental make-up alongside other factors like in which team, league and under what type of manager they are playing. \n\u201cWe have many leagues in the game; no stats provider could offer us data for all these leagues, teams and players.This is also the reason why we use this online database because it\u2019s not possible to buy this data some way \u2014 it just doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Mueller-Moehring was quoted as saying to ESPN . \nHe further went on to add, \u201cThe stats are, in most cases, not taking into account very specific circumstances. When you play for Bayern Munich or if you play for Manchester City or if you play for Pep Guardiola, if your system is based on possession, you will have more successful passes than other players, but this doesn\u2019t necessarily make you a better passer. There is data, but the data never gives you the specific situations.\u201d What\u2019s next? \nFans of the game will have to wait until September this year when FIFA 18 will officially be launched in order to review the player ratings and the quality of the upgrade. It is being speculated that Portuguese star Cristiano Ronaldo will remain the game\u2019s best player and also feature as the cover star. Author\u2019s Take \nIt\u2019s heartening to see the efforts that go into building this popular game. Such steps ensure that the user\u2019s overall experience is enhanced and the developers slowly expand their already huge fan base.

But sometimes, winning means more. \nThat was certainly the case for D'Angelo Russell on Sunday night when he hit a game-winning 3-pointer the same day after the unexpected death of his grandmother. \n\"I just wanted to win,\" Russell said after beating the Timberwolves. \"Win the game, and winning shot, it's just God putting the cherry on top. The win would have been good enough.\" \nThe young guard was close to not playing Sunday night and instead almost chose to travel back home to Louisville.

Our sense of loss is too profound for words. \u201d   \nIt was around 1:00 p.m. Saturday when 33-year-old bodybuilder Abeku Wilson walked into the gym and shot his two former co-workers . Witnesses at the gym said he seemed to know exactly where he was going. Police said he had a target. \n\u201cHe didn\u2019t go inside of where everyone was training,\u201d said a woman who was at the juice bar with her husband. \u201cHe went to the back door, where the staff and manager office are.\u201d \nPolice sources confirmed Wilson was fired earlier Saturday, went home, got a semi-automatic handgun and returned to the gym looking for Ackerman. \nHortis was shot multiple times, according to witnesses. \n\u201cHe was really behind the counter,\u201d the woman said. \u201c(Wilson) was holding the gun, so the guy has no chance. I mean, it was less than a meter away.\u201d \nPolice sources said Wilson had recently returned to work after vacationing in Ghana, where his family is originally from. \nWilson was fired earlier in the day for \u201c work place violence \u201d and was escorted off the premises. \nThose who knew Wilson, a bodybuilding enthusiast, said he was a popular personal trainer. When asked about anger issues, co-workers told CBS4 there were no signs. \nThe shooting sent everyone running. The commotion got the attention of a Coral Gables officer, who ran into the gym. Sources said Wilson saw the officer, ran into a bathroom and shot himself. \nManagement at The Shops at Merrick Park activated their alert system and the mall was evacuated. Some were sheltered inside stores and the entire mall was shut down for hours. \nEquinox staff described Ackerman as a \u201ckind and caring soul.\u201d She was a graduate of FIU where she earned a Master\u2019s degree from the Chaplin School of Hospitality and Tourism Management, and worked for the gym for two years. She was promoted to GM last August. \nHortis was with the gym for six years. \u201cHis generous spirit and warm demeanor made him an always welcome presence in our world,\u201d said an Equinox statement. \n\u201cOur love, prayers and condolences are with both families during this terrible time.

Masters Tournament: Scores | Live blog: Day 3 | Full coverage \nWith a 2-under-par 70, Garcia seemed to finally break the Saturday curse plaguing him at Augusta National. He moved into a share of the 54-hole lead with Justin Rose and will go off with him in Sunday\u2019s final pairing. \n\u201cAt the end of the day, it comes down to me making sure that I keep doing the things that I've been doing all week and just believe that I can do it,\u201d Garcia said. \nOnce the can\u2019t-miss kid, the gifted prodigy who seemed destined to win multiple majors, even Garcia seemed to give up on himself and any chance he would finally break through. \nWasn\u2019t it here that we all gave up on him winning one? \nThis is where Garcia practically shook his fist at the heavens and cursed the golf gods. \nIt\u2019s where he declared he wasn\u2019t good enough to win a major. \n\u201cI don\u2019t have the thing I need to have,\u201d he said here five years ago. \u201cThe conclusion is I need to play for second or third place.\u201d \nMaybe this is where he finally makes his peace with the golf gods. Or maybe where they break his heart again. They certainly smiled on him Saturday with the gift they gave him down at Amen Corner. \nThat\u2019s where Garcia rocketed a 4-iron that slammed into the grassy bank in front of the 13 th green. That ball looked doomed to roll back down into the tributary of Rae\u2019s Creek there, but it seemed to defy gravity, much like Fred Couples \u2019 ball did when it stayed up on the bank above Rae\u2019s Creek at the 12 th when Couples won in 1992. \n\u201cI've definitely had some good breaks throughout all three rounds,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThe 13 th was obviously was one of them. \u201d \nInstead of bogey or maybe worse there, Garcia took advantage. He chipped up to a few inches and made birdie. \nGarcia finished strong, holing a pivotal 6-foot putt for par at the last to secure his share of the lead. \nGarcia looks like a different man than he was five years ago, when he ranted at the Masters over another lost opportunity in a major. He\u2019s engaged to be married to Angela Akins in July. He says there\u2019s more balance and perspective in his life and game now. \n\u201cMy mentality has kind of changed a little bit, the way I\u2019m thinking things, particularly this week at Augusta,\u201d Garcia said. \nGarcia says his once rocky relationship with the Masters is different, too. \n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely improved,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThere's no doubt about that. Nothing wrong with Augusta. It's the kind of place that if you are trying to fight against it, it's going to beat you down. So you've just got to roll with it and realize that sometimes you're going to get good breaks, like has happened to me a few times this week, and sometimes you're going to get not\u2011so\u2011good breaks. But at the end of the day, that's part of the game.\u201d \nGarcia came into Saturday with the worst third-round scoring average of any player over the last 30 Masters. He was cumulatively 38 over par for his career in the third round of this event. \n\u201cI\u2019m glad I took the scoring average down a little bit,\u201d Garcia cracked. \nGarcia idolized Ballesteros, and he will draw inspiration trying to win the Masters on what would have been his idol\u2019s birthday. \nAmen Corner looked like it was jumping with spiritual activity Saturday. \nThat\u2019s where Jordan Spieth invoked the name of Arnold Palmer after he drove into the trees and pine straw at the 13 th . It\u2019s where Spieth shrugged off his caddie\u2019s advice. \n\u201cWhat would Arnold do?\u201d Spieth told caddie Michael Greller before lasering a shot into 30 feet that would set up a two-putt birdie. \nGarcia could ask a similarly inspiring question throughout Sunday. He could ask \u201cWhat would Seve do?\u201d Ballesteros won the Masters in 1980 and \u201983. Garcia\u2019s other idol, Jose Maria Olazabal , also won the Masters twice (1994 and \u201999). \n\u201cI don't want to get ahead of myself,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cI don't even know how much it would mean to be able to join both of my idols as a Masters winner.\u201d Article Tags: ", "ord_in_thread": 0, "title": "Will things finally align for Sergio in a major? | Golf Channel", "external_links": [], "entities": {"organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "augusta national"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "augusta"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "augusta"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ga."}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "rae\u2019s creek"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "creek"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "amen corner"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "augusta"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "neutral", "name": "sergio"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ballesteros"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "arnold palmer"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "rae"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "angela akins"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "fred couples"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "garcia"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "michael greller"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "spieth"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "seve ballesteros"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "sergio garcia"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "jordan spieth"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "jose maria olazabal"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "arnold"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "justin rose"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-09T11:16:19.380+03:00", "published": "2017-04-08T08:00:00.000+03:00"}, {"url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8M6oP54MIiF4v8u8pHfv6AeqYRC8b24YRtDGkpX_6KvLDNrZ2eveyn3GYzZ6v0yu0lWXCr.RNCo9iTHHvqCkjl_mm6rVkCGZfVIglDI7NlQjAqxAvE9Zso_7H7C6yKob.tbpsyVl7WXOOqIgj.OaA31pBobVT1wKvoqTtqpZxEiA--", "uuid": "aebfa876c412d9c721693f3182e389eb403c9430", "thread": {"country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.052, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg8M6oP54MIiF4v8u8pHfv6AeqYRC8b24YRtDGkpX_6KvLDNrZ2eveyn3GYzZ6v0yu0lWXCr.RNCo9iTHHvqCkjl_mm6rVkCGZfVIglDI7NlQjAqxAvE9Zso_7H7C6yKob.tbpsyVl7WXOOqIgj.OaA31pBobVT1wKvoqTtqpZxEiA--", "uuid": "aebfa876c412d9c721693f3182e389eb403c9430", "title_full": "Birmingham EDL protest photo: Woman in viral image was 'not scared in the slightest' | London Evening Standard", "replies_count": 0, "site_section": "", "site": "standard.co.uk", "performance_score": 9, "site_full": "www.standard.co.uk", "site_type": "news", "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 1}, "facebook": {"likes": 922, "shares": 922, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}}, "participants_count": 0, "site_categories": ["news", "entertainment", "sports", "education"], "section_title": "", "title": "Birmingham EDL protest photo: Woman in viral image was 'not scared in the slightest' | London Evening Standard", "domain_rank": 5829, "main_image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/10/06/edl-rally.jpg", "published": "2017-04-10T10:55:36.036+03:00"}, "highlightText": "", "rating": null, "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "author": "Chloe Chaplain", "text": "\nWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

The driver of the No. 48 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet led only those final 17 laps, but that was all that mattered. \nKyle Larson finished second for the fourth time this season, with Logano, Kevin Harvick and Dale Earnhardt Jr. rounding out the top five. \nThere was early trouble for a handful of drivers, but nothing like what many had feared after several of NASCAR\u2019s top wheelmen had encountered trouble with the newly repaved, reconfigured track in the two days leading up to the event. \nAustin Dillon was the first to encounter a problem, but it had nothing to do with the track. His No. 3 Richard Childress Racing Chevrolet somehow suffered a broken tracking arm before the race even went green and had to go to the garage for repairs. \nBy the time Dillon returned, he was 12 laps down. \nShortly thereafter, on Lap 11, the cars of Jeffrey Earnhardt, Reed Sorenson and Gray Gaulding tangled coming out of reconfigured Turn 2, bringing out a caution. \nBut other than those two incidents, Stage 1 went off pretty cleanly. Blaney won it by four car lengths over Martin Truex Jr. \u2013 but the most entertaining racing was done by Kyle Larson, who started 32nd, raced up to 11th, then fell back to 30th when he was assessed a penalty for going through too many pit boxes on the way to his stall during a stop. \nLarson raced his way back up to sixth by the end of Stage 1, then used a solid pit stop in between stages to move up to fourth for the restart that marked the beginning of Stage 2. \nNo one had anything for Blaney in the second 85-lap stage, however. He led 146 of the first 170 laps over the first two stages overall, taking the second incident-free segment as well. \nIt marked the first time a Wood Brothers Racing car had led 100 or more laps in Cup Series race since Neil Bonnett accomplished it at Rockingham in October of 1982. \nBut Sunday\u2019s field took on a different look at the beginning of Stage 3, as 18 drivers who pitted toward the end of the second stage did not come in when Blaney, Larson and others did in between stages. That meant Larson had to start in 19th and Blaney in 20th as the third and final stage, constituted of 164 laps, commenced. \nJimmie Johnson restarted the third stage in 22nd, but his No. 48 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet was fast, too. By the time he came in for a pit stop with 61 laps remaining in the race, he was all the way up to second \u2013 trailing only Martin Truex Jr., who also came in and gave up the lead in doing so. \nBy the time a caution came out for debris, setting up a restart with 33 to go, Johnson again was in second, this time behind Kevin Harvick. \nHarvick\u2019s No. 4 Stewart-Haas Racing team won the race off pit road, followed by Johnson, Truex, Larson and Dale Earnhardt Jr. \u2014 all of whom took on two fresh Goodyear tires. Joey Logano did not pit and inherited the lead by staying out. \nAlthough Logano did a masterful job of holding Johnson off for a total of 13 laps after the ensuing restart, it was only a matter of time until Johnson passed him on the fresher tires. He finally executed that pass with 17 to go. \nBlaney restarted in 16th after overshooting his pit stall on the stop with 33 to go, taking him out of contention after he had dominated the first two stages. It was all he could do to drive back up to 12th by the end.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "title": "Jimmie Johnson wins record seventh race at Texas Motor Speedway", "external_links": [], "entities": {"organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "texas motor speedway"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "goodyear"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "nascar"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "hendrick motorsports chevrolet"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "tms"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "richard childress racing chevrolet"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "stewart-haas racing"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "fort worth"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "texas"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "rockingham"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "jimmie johnson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "joey logano"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "logano"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "larson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kyle larson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dillon"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "gray gaulding"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "dale earnhardt jr."}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "truex"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "neil bonnett"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "austin dillon"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "johnson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "blaney"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "reed sorenson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "kevin harvick"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "jeffrey earnhardt"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "harvick"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "martin truex jr."}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-10T00:30:47.661+03:00", "published": "2017-04-10T00:30:47.661+03:00"}, {"url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS_z3bhhMmPWxAc1znpwxowb6I0PMr0PdO1_Rn_9r6TxGKXB5x34rpYbWT68KiKk3OCZFAjKZ3.5AscTz.z2EkF_teQuZxBqpGtr2gkoQEwfncEl6rsfeFvTj_vv7V1FqhRYtyzFd57vQ--", "uuid": "30b9124555fdaaa6b23ff12a9763ee2934fa8d36", "thread": {"country": "US", "spam_score": 0.0, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/.wHSUbtEfZS_z3bhhMmPWxAc1znpwxowb6I0PMr0PdO1_Rn_9r6TxGKXB5x34rpYbWT68KiKk3OCZFAjKZ3.5AscTz.z2EkF_teQuZxBqpGtr2gkoQEwfncEl6rsfeFvTj_vv7V1FqhRYtyzFd57vQ--", "uuid": "30b9124555fdaaa6b23ff12a9763ee2934fa8d36", "title_full": "Red Sox rally with 4 in 8th inning, beat Tigers 7-5", "replies_count": 0, "site_section": "https://www.boston.com/", "site": "boston.com", "performance_score": 9, "site_full": "www.boston.com", "site_type": "news", "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 992, "shares": 992, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}}, "participants_count": 1, "site_categories": ["news", "sports"], "section_title": "Boston.com - Local breaking news, sports, and culture", "title": "Red Sox rally with 4 in 8th inning, beat Tigers 7-5", "domain_rank": 2430, "main_image": "https://www.boston.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Red_Sox_Tigers_Baseball_59604-850x478.jpg", "published": "2017-04-09T03:00:00.000+03:00"}, "highlightText": "", "rating": null, "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "author": "NOAH TRISTER", "text": "DETROIT (AP) \u2014 Even if the Boston Red Sox hadn\u2019t been short-handed, this would have been a gratifying win.\nSandy Leon broke an eighth-inning tie with a two-run single, part of a four-run rally that lifted Boston to a 7-5 victory over the Detroit Tigers on Sunday.\nThe Red Sox, depleted recently by injury and illness, rallied four times from one-run deficits.\n\u201cThe one thing that hasn\u2019t emerged was anyone talking about any excuses,\u201d manager John Farrell said. \u201cWe know what\u2019s in front of us. We know how people feel.

After an intentional walk, Kyle Ryan came in and walked pinch-hitter Brock Holt to force in the tying run.\nLeon followed with a line drive to center , and Boston led 6-4.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just got to find someone that can pitch the seventh and eighth inning,\u201d Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said. \u201cJustin Wilson was unavailable tonight \u2014 he\u2019d be a guy you could pitch in the eighth inning, but he\u2019d pitched two days in a row, and we didn\u2019t want to use him.\u201d\nMatt Barnes (1-0) got the win in relief for Boston. He\u2019d just come off the bereavement list before the game.\nCraig Kimbrel allowed a run in the ninth but recovered for his second save of the season. He\u2019s converted 21 chances in a row.\nThe Red Sox led 7-4 when Kimbrel walked the first two Detroit hitters in the ninth. The Boston closer then struck out Miguel Cabrera. Victor Martinez nearly tied it with a drive to right, but it went foul, and he ended up settling for an RBI single.\nKimbrel then struck out Upton and Tyler Collins to end it.\nBoston right-hander Rick Porcello allowed four runs \u2014 three earned \u2014 and 11 hits in six-plus innings against his former team. Last year\u2019s AL Cy Young Award winner walked one and struck out eight.\nPorcello looked briefly hobbled at one point when he brushed against Detroit third base coach Dave Clark while going to back up the base.\n\u201cI just kind of landed awkwardly,\u201d Porcello said. \u201cI was watching the ball, and didn\u2019t see him. I heard him say something, and then I tried to move, and I just kind of landed awkwardly. It scared me more than anything, but I\u2019m good to go.\u201d\nPorcello reached 1,000 strikeouts when he fanned Martinez in the first.\nUpton put the Tigers up 1-0 with an RBI single in the first. After Marco Hernandez tied it with a run-scoring single in the second, Ian Kinsler drove in a run with a single in the bottom of the inning.\nMitch Moreland hit an RBI double in the third for the Red Sox, but Detroit took a 3-2 lead on Kinsler\u2019s run-scoring single in the fourth.\nThe Red Sox tied it again in the seventh on an RBI single by Andrew Benintendi. Nicholas Castellanos put the Tigers up 4-3 with a homer in the seventh, but that lead \u2014 like all their others \u2014 was short-lived.\nDaniel Norris allowed three runs and seven hits in 6 1/3 innings for Detroit.\nCRUCIAL OVERTURN\nThe Red Sox appeared to have hit into a double play in the seventh, but a call at second base was overturned after a replay review . It turned out Kinsler had come off the bag an instant before making the catch-and-throw to first.\nThat reversal gave Boston a runner on second with two outs, and Benintendi\u2019s hit tied the game at 3.\nTRAINER\u2019S ROOM\nRed Sox: Before the game, Farrell said Bradley was dealing with some soreness and swelling in his knee.

(David Cannon/Getty Images) \nAUGUSTA, Ga. -- Sergio Garcia tugged the lapel of his Green Jacket with both hands, proud of his prize and how he earned it. \nHis hopes were fading Sunday in the Masters Tournament -- Garcia was two shots behind with six holes to play -- when his tee shot bounced off a tree and into an azalea bush, the kind of bad luck he had come to expect in the majors. Instead of pouting, he figured out how to make par. \nFive feet away from winning, his birdie putt peeled off to the right. Usually resigned to fail, Garcia proved to be more resilient than ever. \nHe was a new man with a new title: Masters champion. \nMajor champion. \n\"It's been an amazing week,\" Garcia said, \"and I'm going to enjoy it for the rest of my life.\" \nAfter nearly two decades of heartache in the tournaments that define careers, Garcia finally showed the mettle to win a major. He overcame a two-shot deficit against Justin Rose and won on the first hole of a sudden-death playoff. \nNo one ever played more majors as a pro (70) before winning one for the first time. \nGarcia got rid of the demons and the doubts with two big moments on the par 5s -- one a par, the other an eagle -- in closing with a 3-under 69. It was never easy until the end, when Rose sent his drive into the trees on the 18th hole in the playoff, punched out and failed to save par from 15 feet. \nThat gave the 37-year-old Spaniard two putts from 12 feet for the victory, and his first putt swirled into the cup for a birdie. \nHe crouched in disbelief, both fists clenched and shaking, and he shouted above the loudest roar of the day. \nRose, who also closed with a 69, graciously patted Garcia's cheek before they embraced. Rose then tapped Garcia on the heart, which turned out to be a lot bigger than anyone realized. \n\"Ser-gee-oh! Ser-gee-oh!\" the delirious gallery chanted to Garcia. He turned with his arms to his side, blew a kiss to the crowd and then crouched again and slammed his fist into the turf of the green. \nAll that Spanish passion was on display, raw as ever, this time sheer joy. \n\"Justin wasn't making it easy. He was playing extremely well,\" Garcia said. \"But I knew what I was capable of doing, and I believe that I could do it.\" \nGarcia became the third Spaniard in a Green Jacket, winning on what would have been the 60th birthday of the late Seve Ballesteros. And it was Jose Maria Olazabal, who won the Masters in 1994 and 1999, who sent him a text on the eve of the Masters telling Garcia to believe and \"to not let things get to me like I've done in the past.\" \nHe didn't get down after missing a 6-foot putt on the 16th hole to fall out of the lead, or missing a 5-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole that would have won in regulation. \nHis chin was up. He battled to the end. \n\"If there's anyone to lose to, it's Sergio. He deserves it,\" Rose said. \"He's had his fair share of heartbreak.\" \nThis was shaping up as another, especially after Garcia watched a three-shot lead disappear as quickly as it took Rose to run off three straight birdies on the front nine. \nTied going to the back nine, Garcia immediately fell two shots behind with wild shots into the pine straw bed under the trees. Rose was poised to deliver a knockout on the par-5 13th when Garcia went left beyond the creek and into the bush. He had to take a penalty shot to get out and hit his third shot 89 yards short of the green. Rose was just over the back of the green in two, in position to turn a two-shot lead into four. \nEveryone figured this was coming, right? If there's anyone to lose to, it's Sergio. He deserves it. He's had his fair share of heartbreak. - Justin Rose \nGarcia himself had said, in a moment of self-pity, that he didn't have what it takes to win a major. Four times he was runner-up. This was his third time playing in the final group. But right when it looked to be over, momentum shifted to Garcia. \nHe hit wedge to 7 feet and escaped with par. Rose rolled his chip down to 5 feet and missed the birdie putt. The lead stayed at two shots, and the game was on. \nGarcia birdied the 14th to get within one. His 8-iron into the par-5 15th -- \"One of the best shots I hit all week,\" he said -- landed inches in front of the hole and nicked the pin, and he holed the 14-foot eagle putt to tie for the lead. \nRose took the lead with an 8-foot birdie on the 16th and gave it back by missing a 7-foot par putt on the 18th. \nNot since 1998 have the last two players on the course gone to the 18th tied for the lead, and both had their chances to win. Rose's approach hit off the side of the bunker and kicked onto the green, stopping 7 feet away. Garcia answered with a wedge that covered the flag and settled 5 feet away. \nBoth missed. \nThe playoff didn't last long. Rose was in trouble from the start with a tee shot that sailed right, leaving him blocked by a Magnolia tree. He chipped out under the tree, hit his third shot to 15 feet and missed the par putt. \nFormer Masters champion Charl Schwartzel birdied the 18th for a 68 to finish third. Matt Kuchar made a hole-in-one on the 16th that gave him hope but not for very long. He tied for fourth with Thomas Pieters, who ran off four birdies on the back nine. \nJordan Spieth, starting the final round only two shots behind, put another tee shot into the water on No. 12 long after it mattered. He had to birdie three of his last four holes for a 75. Also an afterthought was Rickie Fowler, who started one shot behind and shot 76. \nAll that mattered was Garcia and Rose, who delivered a final hour as compelling as any at the Masters and a champion who began to wonder if he would ever win a major. \nGarcia says he has learned to accept bad bounces. He realized he has a \"beautiful life\" even if he never won a major. \n\"If it, for whatever reason, didn't happen, my life is still going to go on. It's not going to be a disaster,\" Garcia said. \nAnd then smiling, he added, \"But it happened.\" MORE FROM PGA TOUR", "ord_in_thread": 0, "title": "Garcia gets first major, wins the Masters in playoff", "external_links": [], "entities": {"organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "augusta national"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "green jacket"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "augusta"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ga."}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "neutral", "name": "sergio g"}, {"sentiment": "neutral", "name": "garcia"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "david"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "sergio"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "rickie fowler"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "justin rose  garcia"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "charl schwartzel"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "thomas pieters"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "justin"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "seve ballesteros"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "matt kuchar"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "sergio garcia"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "jordan spieth"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "rose"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "jose maria olazabal"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "justin rose"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-10T08:54:54.656+03:00", "published": "2017-04-10T07:35:00.000+03:00"}, {"url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Pd3VBJ3zdLJeHHCuDng8d5kD26RoCDnuBdqeHMUoWrVxR9OkT3YnxQ.auwe5iOIsk9u9F1Xf8ZPrmwq7Gt.ACUHa2fUP_cGiudSu0mDe2en_hjcowDnfcfZ_mWJ0hbw0fsbhF.PLsF.itPjXZOVYc", "uuid": "ef6637238a32d0c57c0a49182e0b44aecf58dfc1", "thread": {"country": "US", "spam_score": 0.137, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.Pd3VBJ3zdLJeHHCuDng8d5kD26RoCDnuBdqeHMUoWrVxR9OkT3YnxQ.auwe5iOIsk9u9F1Xf8ZPrmwq7Gt.ACUHa2fUP_cGiudSu0mDe2en_hjcowDnfcfZ_mWJ0hbw0fsbhF.PLsF.itPjXZOVYc", "uuid": "ef6637238a32d0c57c0a49182e0b44aecf58dfc1", "title_full": "Jeep drops Hellcat engine into Grand Cherokee Trackhawk", "replies_count": 0, "site_section": "http://rssfeeds.freep.com/freep/home", "site": "freep.com", "performance_score": 9, "site_full": "www.freep.com", "site_type": "news", "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 938, "shares": 938, "comments": 10}, "linkedin": {"shares": 13}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 1}}, "participants_count": 1, "site_categories": ["news", "sports"], "section_title": "Detroit Free Press - Home", "title": "Jeep drops Hellcat engine into Grand Cherokee Trackhawk", "domain_rank": 2980, "main_image": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b8187ac2c5c7c14ba9fd0d7e3b450228acc3d522/c=0-109-2349-1436&amp;r=x633&amp;c=1200x630/local/-/media/2017/04/07/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/636271746004333743-2018-Jeep-Grand-Cherokee-21.JPG", "published": "2017-04-09T08:19:49.337+03:00"}, "highlightText": "", "rating": null, "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "author": "freep.com", "text": "MORE Jeep is taking the plunge into the deep end of the horsepower wars with the Grand Cherokee Trackhawk, a version of its midsize SUV that is equipped with a 707-horsepower Hellcat engine.\nThe Hellcat is a supercharged 6.2-liter V-8 engine that has become an icon for the Dodge brand since it was introduced in the Charger and Challenger in 2014.\nNow it will be plugged into the 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee Trackhawk that will be revealed to the media at the New York International Auto Show on Wednesday.\nRead more:\nJeep enthusiasts get an early Easter surprise\nNew Jeep Compass goes for the globe\nThe Grand Cherokee Trackhawk also becomes the latest vehicle from Fiat Chrysler to feature horsepower rather than fuel economy, safety, technology or any other attribute as its No. 1 selling point.

Hand in the dirt, working man, just throw the fries on the sandwich, etc. That stems from teams that played in a different generation, and some of the guys who played then aren\u2019t all that impressed with the current iteration. \nOne guy specifically -- Hall of Famer \u201cMean\u201d Joe Greene -- actually thinks that the Steelers are so full of preeners that they couldn\u2019t win as much in 2016 as they should have. \nGreene, speaking to Ed Bouchette of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette , called 2016 a \u201cyear lost\u201d because of some weapons they lost as well as \u201cguys who like to showboat.\u201d \n\u201cWe got guys who like to showboat. It\u2019s definitely the one [Brown], but it\u2019s more than one. And they owe themselves better than that,\u201d Greene said. \u201cYou only have so long to play this game, it\u2019s not always going to be there, you know. You have to max out. \n\u201cThis year was a year lost. I can only imagine what would have happened to this team had our receiver who was suspended for a year [ Martavis Bryant ] been playing on the field. I can only imagine what would have happened had all of our weapons been there.\u201d \nIt\u2019s easy to remember 2016 as a year where Brown aired a Facebook Live video in the playoffs that potentially distracted his team. But that sort of ignores the fact that the Steelers did make the AFC Championship Game. They were manhandled by the Patriots in New England, but they were still one win away from making the Super Bowl . \nIf that\u2019s a lost year, well, the standard is pretty freaking high. Expectations for these Steelers are probably always to win the Super Bowl; but certainly no one was embarrassed by what the Steelers did in 2016 even if the team fell short. \nThere were certainly some ... issues floating out there after the loss to New England. \nThis is also not the first time Greene has come out against Brown and the current Steelers. He previously said that he would have released Brown after the wide receiver\u2019s locker room Facebook situation. \nAnd the Hall of Famer believes that Roethlisberger\u2019s response \u201chad to be something with his disappointment with those activities\u201d according to Greene, who added that \u201c[t]hose actions were not conducive to the winning framework, the winning attitude.\u201d \nTo Greene, the guys on the field did not necessarily live up to the Steelers \u201cbrand.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m saying right now we need someone in there who epitomizes what the Steelers are about and doesn\u2019t mind picking up that gauntlet to be a Steeler and not to be out there creating -- what do they call it? -- their brand,\u201d Greene said. \u201cYou have to be a Pittsburgh Steeler first. You can\u2019t create that act.\u201d \nSo it\u2019s pretty clear where everyone in and around Pittsburgh stands on this: the Steelers have a core group of talented players. Roethlisberger, Brown and Le\u2019Veon Bell give the Steelers a window to win a championship. \nThey just need to get down to the business of football and take things a little more seriously.

So why isn\u2019t there any interest? \nHe may have priced himself out of the market. A report in the first days of free agency that he was asking for more than $10 million a year could have led teams to turn elsewhere until Hankins lowers his asking price. The one-year, $8 million contracts signed by free agent defensive tackles Dontari Poe and Bennie Logan indicate that teams just aren\u2019t looking to spend that kind of money at that position. \nHankins is a good player who started all 16 games for the Giants last year and could start for most teams. Some team will surely pay him starter money, but it may not be soon, and it may not be anything close to the money Hankins is asking for.

Some believe it\u2019s a load of nonsense and that players should celebrate passionately, while others feel it\u2019s respectful. \nOne player who certainly enjoyed scoring against his former employers this weekend was Malaga\u2019s Sandro Ramirez, who broke the deadlock against Barcelona at La Rosaleda on Saturday night. Article continues below \nSandro made 32 appearances for Bar\u00e7a during the 2014-15 and 2015-16 campaigns but was offloaded to Malaga last summer. \nThe intense competition for first-team places at the Camp Nou ultimately cost Sandro his dream of making it at Barcelona, although his move to Malaga has worked out nicely for him. Article continues below Isco sends tweet to Malaga after their 2-0 win v Barcelona and Twitter erupts Sandro's celebration v Barcelona \nThe 21-year-old has scored 10 goals in 23 appearances for the Andalusian outfit. His goal against Barcelona was his ninth in La Liga this term. \nHe celebrated enthusiastically after netting against Luis Enrique\u2019s side, although it\u2019s hard to agree with the Catalan newspaper Sport when they describe his celebrations as \u201cwild\u201d. \nSee his celebration for yourself here\u2026 \n(La Liga copyright issues may require you to click 'Watch on YouTube') Suarez had words with Sandro at half-time \nNevertheless, Sandro\u2019s celebration obviously irritated Luis Suarez because the Barcelona forward had words with his former teammate as they walked towards the tunnel at half-time. \nSuarez was spotted saying something in the Canadian player\u2019s ear - and Sport have now revealed what the Uruguayan said. \nAccording to Sandro, Suarez told him: \u201cNever forget who fed you.\u201d \nThis was clearly a message from Suarez that, in his opinion, Sandro had overstepped the mark with his celebration and should have been more respectful to his former club. Sandro: I ask for forgiveness \nThe youngster responded after the match by telling reporters it wasn\u2019t his intention to upset anyone associated with Barcelona. \n\u201cI ask forgiveness if this has happened,\u201d he said in the mixed zone. \u201cI ask forgiveness, not to Barcelona\u2019s fans but the people at La Masia, who have given me everything.\u201d Sandro didn't need to apologise \nIn truth, Sandro didn\u2019t do anything wrong and shouldn\u2019t have felt the need to apologise. \nYes, Barcelona gave him the opportunity to learn his trade, but he\u2019s a Malaga player now - so why shouldn\u2019t he celebrate scoring against one of the best teams in the world? \nBar\u00e7a\u2019s 2-0 defeat at La Rosaleda leaves their La Liga title hopes hanging by a thread. \nDefeat in the Clasico on April 23 and Real Madrid will surely win their first league title since 2012. \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?

Full Game Coverage \nTied at 3, thanks to Judge's first homer of the season -- an eighth-inning solo shot off Mychal Givens -- New York piled on Orioles reliever Darren O'Day . After a leadoff walk by Matt Holliday , pinch-runner Jacoby Ellsbury stole second and scored on Starlin Castro 's single. Judge drove in another run, and a sacrifice fly by Austin Romine combined with Jonathan Schoop 's throwing error tacked two more on.

The pair of runs, which came on Ronald Torreyes ' triple, marked the first runs of the season allowed by Baltimore's bullpen. Torreyes extended his team-lead in RBIs to seven in the process. \nBaltimore got RBIs from Mark Trumbo , Trey Mancini and J.J. Hardy , though Yankees veteran CC Sabathia did his best to keep New York in the game over his six frames. The Yanks bats couldn't say the same, as New York didn't record a hit off starter Wade Miley until the fifth inning despite getting seven walks.

He also took a needless shot at James\u2019 kids, which caused James to tell him to pipe down . \n\u201cNo regrets,\u201d Ball said. \u201cWhatever I say, I never regret it because I think about it before I say it.\u201d \nBall rejected the notion that he was saying any of these things to get attention and get people riled up. \n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing,\u201d Ball said. \u201cI say exactly what I feel.

I\u2019ll leave it at that.\u201d \nBall then claimed he had \u201ca lot of people\u201d who think Lonzo is better than Curry.

Of course, the winner of The Masters each year receives a jacket, but may take it off the Augusta National grounds only during the year in which they are the defending champion. Club members also receive a jacket with the Augusta National logo, but may not take their jacket off club grounds. \nSo how this 1950s-era green jacket ended up in a Toronto thrift store is a mystery. However, its status was no mystery to the buyer; according to the Post, the man is an avid golfer who knew exactly what he had found. \nGreen Jacket Auctions opened bidding for the jacket at $5,000.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email \nA newborn baby died after a midwife switched off a heart monitor alarm warning that his life was in danger 16 times, it has emerged. \nLittle Rupert Sanders \"would have survived\" were it not for the failure to follow basic medical procedure during his birth , a hearing heard. \nBut midwife Carol Marston - who repeatedly cancelled the alarm - has not been struck off by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). \nAnd nor has a colleague who also failed to heed the monitor's warnings. \nMeanwhile, Rupert's family claim the hospital's probe into his death was kept secret and there has been a \"cover-up\". \nThe infant would likely now be a four-year-old bundle of joy for his parents, Lauren and Robert Sanders, from Staffordshire. \nBut the life was tragically choked out of him in the womb in 2012 when the placental cord caught around his neck. Midwife Carol Marston switched off a heart monitor alarm warning that Rupert's life was in danger 16 times (Photo: central news) \nThat squeezed and narrowed the cord - depriving him of oxygenated blood. \nMidwife Carol Marston should have picked up on warnings from the bedside cardiotocograph (CTG) machine that Rupert was struggling and called an obstetrician for help, the NMC was told. \nInstead, she repeatedly cancelled the machine's alarm at former Stafford Hospital in the mistaken belief there was nothing wrong. \nFellow midwife, Anne Mather, also failed to spot the looming catastrophe. Read More Parents thought baby's habit of sticking out his tongue was adorable - but it was a sign of something awful \nRupert was born in an extremely poor state at the scandal-hit hospital five years ago. He sadly died three days later. \nHis death occurred at the height of the Mid Staffs inquiry into hundreds of deaths of patients at the hospital that were covered up. \nHis midwives have been sanctioned by the NMC - but only after a concerted campaign by the little boy's grieving family. \nMr and Mrs Sanders, of Stoke on Trent, remain so traumatised by the loss of their child they do not want to talk publicly. The infant's parents, Lauren and Robert Sanders, remain so traumatised they do not want to talk publicly about their loss (Photo: central news) \nBut Mrs Sanders's mum, retired teacher Andrea O'Rafferty said: \"From the beginning to end, the whole thing smacks of a great big cover-up. \n\"They all hoped it would just disappear. The NMC is meant to uphold public confidence in the profession. \n\"But who would look at what's happened here and think the midwife's been told off and that's enough? \n\"I can't believe anybody could fail so extraordinarily in their care, and be allowed to continue to practise.\" Read More \nMrs Sanders, then 27 and a midwife herself, was admitted to the hospital's labour ward at 2.25pm on December 23, 2012. \nThe first-time mum's waters had broken the previous day. \nThat evening, Mrs Marston, now 46, and Mrs Mather started their shifts. \nMrs Mather, now 60, was meant to be Mrs Marston's 'buddy', checking her decisions, the panel was told. \nEverything was progressing normally, but at 10.30pm, Mrs Marston neglected to check the CTG machine, as she was meant to do. (Photo: central news) \nFifteen minutes later, Rupert's heartbeat dipped - the first sign of trouble. \nAt 11.30pm the midwife checked the machine's paper \"trace\", classifying it as \"suspicious\". Mrs Mather confirmed her analysis. \nAt that moment, they should have called a doctor, as protocols dictate. \nHowever, neither did. \nMrs Sanders told the NMC: \"The alarm sounded 16 times but it was silenced and no doctor was called. I will forever bear so much guilt that I did nothing to stop this from happening, but I did not know it was happening.\" Read More \nAn obstetrician told the panel that if a timely caesarean had been carried out - at around 11.40pm - then Rupert \"would have survived\". \nInstead, the infant was born shortly after 1am on Christmas Eve that year. \nHe passed away on December 27 of multiple organ failure, leaving his parents devastated the Express & Star reports. \nFifteen months later, following the happy birth of daughter Betsy by caesarean, Mrs Sanders asked Stafford Hospital for Rupert's birthing notes. \nBesides the errors themselves, the family said she learned the hospital had 'quietly' carried out a Serious Incident Review. The little boy was born in an extremely poor state at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital (file picture) \nIt then reportedly passed the matter to senior midwife Wendy Carroll, a local midwifery 'supervisor'- who was \"friends\" with Mrs Marston. \nShe did not involve the NMC, instead recommending both women underwent remedial training, the family claim. \nMrs O'Rafferty, 58, said: \"They had a friend investigating a friend. \n\"You can't have that! If it hadn't been for Lauren asking for her notes, all this would never have come to light.\" Read More \nAfter learning of the internal reviews, Lauren swiftly referred both Mrs Marston and Mrs Mather to the NMC. \nAfter the NMC hearings two weeks ago, Mrs Marston was given a five-year caution. \nShe was given credit for being 'open and honest' about her mistakes and taking responsibility for them. \nMrs Mather, meanwhile, received an 18-month interim suspension. \nMedical negligence lawyer Emma Rush, of Irwin Mitchell, said the experience had left Rupert's parents \"questioning the transparency\" of the internal hospital review process.

Listen, Joe, thanks for everything. However, I'm selling you to Stoke City. PAUL ELLIS/Getty Images Featured Columnist April 9, 2017 Don't let the smile fool you\u2014Jurgen Klopp is a ruthless manager. The German's arrival at Anfield in October 2015 left him working with someone else's squad. Over the remainder of the season, he took the chance not only to instil his philosophy but also assess the players former boss Brendan Rodgers had left behind. When the summer arrived, however, Klopp turned into football's version of Edward Scissorhands . He chopped away at the roster like Johnny Depp's character going at a privet hedge. Some of his decisions were straightforward; there was no desire to have Mario Balotelli lingering around any longer than necessary, it was just a matter of finding a club willing to take on the Italian. Martin Skrtel, meanwhile, had outstayed his welcome and was rightly shipped out to Fenerbahce . Others, however, were tougher calls. In allowing so many players to leave ( TransferMarkt lists 18 departures\u2014including those sent out on loan\u2014since the end of last season), Liverpool were going to be left with a smaller squad, one that Klopp opted not to add to in the January window this year. But while they say absence makes the heart grow fonder, have the Reds really missed any of the old boys? Bleacher Report put the question to you, the reader, via a Twitter poll: Rob Lancaster @RobLancs79 Jurgen Klopp has allowed A LOT of players to leave Anfield, but who have Liverpool missed the most this season? @br_uk 4/6/2017, 1:59:24 PM While it was no surprise to see Mamadou Sakho come on top, perhaps 52 per cent was a surprisingly low number for the defender. Still, we took a greater look at the three main options offered, listing them in reverse order of how they finished in the vote and asked how they could have aided Liverpool in 2016/17. Christian Benteke: The Missing Piece that Didn't Fit Benteke seems far happier in a leading role for Crystal Palace. Matthew Lewis/Getty Images From the outset, Christian Benteke looked a strange signing by Liverpool. It wasn't just a question of price. The Belgian was hardly a bargain at \u00a339.53 million, yet Aston Villa will feel they could have asked for more were it not for a release clause set into his contract. It wasn't a question of pedigree either. Certainly not in terms of goals\u2014Benteke had scored 49 in 101 games for his previous club, an impressive record considering Villa's struggles to retain their top-flight status. No, the doubts were there from the outset because the Reds, apparently, were choosing substance over style. Here was Benteke, a big, strong striker who feasted on service from out wide, joining a Reds squad that had just lost their leading winger, Raheem Sterling, to Manchester City . For Brendan Rodgers, it felt like the last act of a desperate manager. Still, Benteke played just six times before the Northern Irishman lost his job. Klopp continued to use him after taking charge, albeit 22 of his 36 appearances under the German came off the bench. \"I did not fit the tactical system of the new coach,\" the forward said after leaving Liverpool last summer, per James Gray of the Express . \"That was not easy mentally because I was left to fight a losing battle.\" At Crystal Palace , however, the Belgian has prospered as the centrepiece of the team's forward line. He's scored 11 Premier League goals, including four headers and two penalties. Notably, he's only failed to complete 90 minutes in four of his 28 starts in the league. Even during a scoreless seven-game run that stretched from the middle of December to the end of January, Benteke continued to be a key cog for the Eagles. He was never going to be afforded such patience at Liverpool, though, particularly as he hardly fitted the mould of a Klopp striker. Could you see him pressing and harrying opposing defences in the same manner as Roberto Firmino? No is the correct answer. While the 26-year-old could still have served a purpose in certain situations, there is little to suggest Liverpool are worse off for his absence. If someone as talented as Daniel Sturridge struggles to get minutes when fit, Benteke would surely have festered even longer on the sidelines, had he stuck around. A move away suited all parties (as is also likely to be the case for Sturridge this summer). Joe Allen: The Welsh Xavi Joe Allen has prospered when pushed further forward by Stoke City boss Mark Hughes. Richard Heathcote/Getty Images Hampered by the above nickname handed down to him by Rodgers, the manager he followed from Swansea City , Allen's Liverpool career was book-ended by a sticky start and a late lease of life. Famously dubbed the Welsh Xavi after joining, he looked unable to cope with the pressure of expectation. Yet towards the end of his time on Merseyside, the player went from overrated and underappreciated to something akin to cult-hero status. Maybe it was because of the long hair, but something changed and the cold-hearted haters thawed a little towards him. Klopp didn't take long to warm to Allen, who was involved throughout the 2015/16 season and became a regular off the bench in the club's unlikely run to the UEFA Europa League final. Yet there was no denying he was stuck down the midfield pecking order. A starring role for Wales at Euro 2016 was followed by a move to Stoke (who paid \u00a313.18 million). Like Benteke's exit, the deal made sense for all involved, and Allen has blossomed away from the limelight of Liverpool thanks to regular minutes. That doesn't mean Klopp doesn't still think about his little super sub, according to quotes he gave to James Pearce of the Liverpool Echo ahead of the 4-1 win over Stoke last December: \nDo we miss Joe Allen? Yes. He\u2019s a nice guy, unbelievably strong player. \nBut it was a kind of joint decision. We had a clear conversation and it was about what I could kind of guarantee. \nIt wasn't that he asked me how many games he would start but for the past one or two years he hadn't been a fixed line up player. Sometimes injuries were the reason. At a time when the Reds are without injured skipper Jordan Henderson, the presence of Allen\u2014who has missed just one league game so far this season\u2014would have helped. Yet he would still be no more than a plaster over a paper cut, a temporary solution that could be removed once back to full health. While tidy on the ball and industrious without it, the 27-year-old made the right move for his career. Had he stayed on at Liverpool, it is hard to see how he would have been anything more than a regular...on the bench. Mamadou Sakho: The French (Dis)Connection Michael Jones @MichaelJ1414 @RobLancs79 @br_uk Sakho has been a revelation for palace and would bring solidity and stability to Liverpool's defence 4/6/2017, 2:30:19 PM Unlike Allen and Benteke, Sakho's (temporary) departure from Merseyside wasn't down to a lack of opportunities or a failure to fit in with the side's playing style. The Frenchman was regularly used by Klopp until his 2015/16 season was cut short by a doping ban. He would have expected to be in the mix for a starting role on his return, only to rub his manager up the wrong way during the club's pre-season tour of the United States. \"It's not that serious. He missed the departure of the plane, he missed a session and then was late for a meal... I have to build a group here, I have to start anew, so I thought it maybe made sense that he flew home to Liverpool and after eight days, when we come back, we can talk about it,\" a bemused Klopp said . Sakho has helped steer Crystal Palace away from the relegation zone. GLYN KIRK/Getty Images However, it turns out the former Borussia Dortmund coach holds a grudge. Sakho spent the first half of the season stuck in purgatory/playing for the under-21 team. Thankfully, Crystal Palace rode in to rescue him from Klopp's doghouse with a loan deal in the January window. While the centre-back started life at Selhurst Park by helping his new team keep three successive clean sheets, some Liverpool supporters questioned whether Klopp should bury the hatchet and bring the player back into the fold. The Reds have the leakiest defence in the top six, with their tally of 40 goals against three more than even second-from-bottom/surely doomed Middlesbrough have conceded. Joel Matip and Dejan Lovren are a steady enough pairing. Ragnar Klavan, however, only looks the part if you want him to represent you at a facial hair convention, while Lucas Leiva's occasional appearances at the heart of the defence remind you that slow, under-sized square pegs cannot be jammed into round holes. With exciting prospect Joe Gomez slowly making his way back after two injury-plagued seasons, you can easily see how there is space in the first-team squad to include the larger-than-life Sakho. However, you often become a better player when you're not in the team. Fans have a way of blurring out the bad moments from their memories, and Sakho's performances for Palace don't necessarily suggest he would immediately shore up Liverpool's leaky rearguard. \"He will defend resolutely, he obviously gives his all in games. But he\u2019s a bit erratic and rash to play at the top level, and that's why Liverpool let him go,\" pundit Gary Neville told Sky Sports (h/t James Cambridge of the Express ). Liverpool also let Sakho leave because he wouldn't adhere to the standards expected off the field. Klopp saves his hugs for those who buy into being part of his ethos. Those who play by their own rules just get the cold shoulder instead. Per Neil Jones of the Liverpool Echo , Sakho's Palace spell is less about repairing old wounds and more a case of appearing in the shop window. Eventually he will be sold to the highest bidder. Thanks But No Thanks PaulMcC @PaulMcC185 @RobLancs79 @karlmatchett @br_uk None. Allen isn't better than anyone we have, midfield now better, Benteke didn't fit, we conceded around 50 a season when Sakho was here 4/6/2017, 5:35:52 PM It was noticeable that when asking for alternative names in the poll, a number of responses stated how Liverpool did not need any of their recent departures back. Having Allen, Benteke and Sakho would have been particularly helpful during a busy January when the wheels came off Liverpool's trophy-chasing bandwagon in spectacular fashion, but it's hard to believe the Reds would now be hot on the heels of leaders Chelsea if any of the trio were still around. And what about any other names suggested? Olivier S. @HungrySkull 4/6/2017, 2:28:48 PM Bring up Jon Flanagan\u2014AKA the Red Cafu\u2014and you're living too far in the past (an unhealthy thing Liverpool supporters tend to do). The Flanagan we saw in 2013/14 would have helped this season, possibly even squeezing out James Milner to start on the left side of the defence. But injuries have hampered the full-back's career in the last two years. Sent out on loan to get games, the 24-year-old has barely featured for Premier League rivals Burnley . Mwaita12 @mwaitagordon 4/6/2017, 2:43:46 PM Unlike Flanagan, Lazar Markovic is performing during his temporary spell with Hull City . The speedy Serbian caught the eye of the Tigers, who took him in January after his season-long deal at Sporting Lisbon was cut short. Still, his situation feels similar to Sakho's. Liverpool will be pleased he's playing now but not necessarily because he's coming back to Anfield to be part of their long-term plans. According to Simon Jones of the MailOnline, West Ham United are ready to pay as much as \u00a316 million for Markovic in the summer. Yes, that's right. \u00a316 whole million. That money will come in handy because after a major pruning job during the last off-season, Liverpool should be more concerned with additions than subtractions this coming summer.

during Sunday's 4-2 win over Leicester City. \nWhile the Englishman only recorded an assist, he was superb in the No.10 role and produced one of the game's best moments to set up Romelu Lukaku. \nFrom the right flank, Barkley whipped an inch-perfect David Beckham-esque cross into the box for Lukaku to power a header past Kasper Schmeichel. Article continues below \nNow 23-years-old, Barkley has become a pivotal figure for Everton, yet there's an air of uncertainty about his future at the club. \nHis current deal expires in 2018 and with the clock ticking on signing a new contract, Ronald Koeman has threatened to sell Barkley in the summer. Article continues below What happened on Barcelona bus after surprise Malaga defeat \n\"We offer him a new contract, and then [there are] two possibilities,\" Koeman said after the game, per Sky Sports . \n\"One, he signs that contract, if he doesn't sign that contract then we need to sell the player. It's simple - it's not so difficult in my opinion.\" \nLosing Barkley would come as a huge blow to Everton who, armed with the young talents of Lukaku and Tom Davies, continue to improve with every season. \nHowever, questions remain over Barkley's behaviour off the pitch and that notion was reinforced following the emphatic win over Leicester. \nShocking CCTV footage has emerged showing what appears to be Barkley getting punched in a nightclub in the early hours of Monday morning (see below). BARKLEY INVOLVED IN FIGHT \nIn the video, which shows the date April 10 towards the end, Barkley can be seen talking to a man before getting floored with one punch. Onlookers then separate the pair. \nIt's unclear exactly what prompted the man to hit Barkley, but you can be sure Everton will issue an immediate response. \nThe attacking midfielder has always been prone to criticism but according to Phil Neville, he can't understand how anyone has a bad word to say about him. \n\"I hope he stays, as an Everton supporter and former player,\" Neville said on Sky Sports , per the Daily Mail . \"I hate the people who don't rate Ross Barkley. \n\"It absolutely kills me every time I see someone write or speak badly about him. \n\"I think you have got to look at the ability of the boy. As an English footballing nation, we should be supporting someone with that talent.\" \nDo YOU want to write for GiveMeSport?

I know that my team owner (Rick Hendrick) is at least okay with me being out there. \n\u201cI look at the video I posted recently and I\u2019m on a very low pitch, very wide-open, powder snow. I mean it\u2019s the best conditions. \u2026 and nobody around. It was in this private area of the mountain. We were riding in this CAT to get out to it. I felt like I was managing my risk pretty damn well to go into that environment.\u201d \nJohnson\u2019s contention, as with many athletes before him who like to dabble in other adrenaline-driven adventures while away from their real jobs, is that anyone can get hurt doing just about anything at any time in this world. \nPlus, you can\u2019t change who you are \u2013 and to stay mentally and physically sharp, sometimes you have to do the things that you believe help that process. \n\u201cYou could get run over by a car cycling, running, you could step off the curb in front of a bus,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cAgain, I feel like every driver is willing to take a certain risk for their fitness and to live their life. Me being on those skis, it\u2019s more about living my life and doing something I enjoy.\u201d \nOnce arriving in Texas, Johnson put in 100 miles riding a bike on Friday and Saturday. He even got his Hendrick Motorsports teammate, Dale Earnhardt Jr., to put in 20 miles each of those days on a bike. \n\u201cSure, there are a lot of drivers right now getting fit,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cA lot of guys are choosing to ride the bike, and somebody is going to fall and get hurt. It just happens. \n\u201cWhen it does, I hope that everybody in this (media) room and I hope our fans don\u2019t overreact. We have to live our lives. We didn\u2019t develop these out-of-control tendencies in a race car by sitting in a rubber room playing chess. We\u2019ve got to live our lives. I say all that because at some point somebody will get hurt and I just don\u2019t want there to be an overreaction.\u201d \nWhile someone somewhere is still likely to do exactly that when and if a driver gets hurt doing something out of the box away from the track, there is one thing you can\u2019t argue with after Sunday. \nWhatever Johnson is doing is working, as proven by his record seventh career win at Texas.

So is Rose for being a good sport. Rec Sergio Garcia\u2019s career-long major championship dry spell is over. He beat Justin Rose in a tantalizing playoff at the Masters on Sunday, finally closing the deal on a major Sunday after years and years of close calls but narrow misses. One of the coolest moments of the championship came just before Garcia sealed the green jacket by putting out. Rose had a poor tee shot and second shot on the first playoff hole, and Garcia stuck his second shot inside of Rose\u2019s third shot. Because it\u2019s a sudden-death playoff, Garcia was clearly in the driver\u2019s seat. Rose must\u2019ve known that, because he did a really cool thing. Garcia was the sport\u2019s poster boy for major championship futility, not having won one in more than a decade at the top of the sport. So Rose decided to let Garcia walk ahead of him to the green, taking in the adulation of Augusta National\u2019s patrons all to himself. Watch Rose, gamely hanging behind as Garcia soaks up the scene: Golf has many ways of sucking people into its romance. Rose letting Garcia walk to the green himself before the biggest moment of his career is one of those ways. Congratulations to Garcia on his first major title, and thanks to Rose for making a cool moment just a little bit cooler.

Last summer, he spent many nights on the grass, his backpack clutched to his chest.\nWhen it rained he would lie on cardboard on an elevated grate so water wouldn\u2019t collect beneath him. On it, someone had written in black marker: \u201cI am high. I am low. I am cold with nowhere to go.\u201d\nA few months later, Ribble, 52, did have somewhere to go: a publicly subsidized basement apartment on Coxwell Ave. that cost $950 a month and which he tried to make his home. He found the place through a city-run program designed to get vulnerable people into housing.\nFor four months, Ribble lived in the damp, dirty, graffiti-covered basement punctured with cracks and holes, many sloppily patched with crumbling spray foam.\n \u201cI left that place to be homeless again,\u201d he says.\nRibble is one of thousands of people who struggle to find a place to live in Toronto, where for many even the worst apartments are too expensive. The Star followed his case for four months, to understand how, despite city programs, support workers and help paying rent, he ended up back on the street.\nOn Dec. 30, he packed up his turquoise-and-purple backpack, picked up his green duffel. It was minus 2C and snow covered the ground.\n\u201cI\u2019ll manage,\u201d Ribble says, heading for the door. \u201cLike I said, I am only taking what I can carry. Even that is too much, but I\u2019ll get by.\u201d\nRibble spent the next three months in city shelters and drop-ins, at Out of the Cold programs, or with friends.\n\u201cI just prefer to stay outside, because I don\u2019t have the temperament to deal with some of these guys anymore,\u201d in shelters, he says, behind the library in March.\nRibble grew up in Regent Park and lived in Toronto for most of his life. He once worked as a unionized drywall taper, earning $80,000 a year, he says, and often enjoyed an after-work martini.\nHe suffers from clinical depression and says he ended up in the system after his skull was \u201csplit in half\u201d during an attack with a pipe in Regent Park, some 20 years back.\nDrug addiction, he says, has helped keep him on the street. When he\u2019s been high, he\u2019s stolen things, or threatened a family member. When he\u2019s been caught, he\u2019s pleaded guilty. He\u2019s entered rehabilitation. He\u2019s been sent to rooming houses, which are ridden with drugs and crime. The cycle repeats. Frustration fuels his temper. He has yelled at staff at the Scott Mission. They have kicked him out temporarily, several times.\nNo matter what a person has done or where they have been, he says, everybody deserves a clean and safe place to live, to recover.\nRibble says everybody asks, if the apartment was so bad why did he move in?\nFor him, the question is why was the landlord allowed to rent it out in the first place?\nJames Ribble stands in the bedroom of his basement apartment. He says he had to pull out mould-filled carpet, baseboards and pieces of drywall. ( Steve Russell ) Last summer, Ribble slept outside until a rainy spell forced him indoors.\n\u201cIt\u2019s cold, I\u2019m soaking wet, I have to walk around in wet clothes all day, because stuff in my bag is wet,\u201d says Ribble.\nHe went to a city-run, multi-service hub at Peter and Richmond Sts. where people get help finding a shelter or housing. There, he says, he was connected to Streets to Homes , who sent him to the house on Coxwell.\nThe program has helped 5,500 people find homes since 2005. Almost 90 per cent of clients stay for more than a year and everybody is offered additional supports to help them stay housed, said Patricia Anderson, with the city\u2019s Shelter, Support and Housing Administration division, in an email. Those follow-up services were audited in 2014, and they are working to implement the recommendations, she says.\nHousing workers help identify affordable units and educate tenants on their rights and responsibilities. Workers recommend they go with people to view apartments, but the decision to rent is entirely up to the tenant, although caseworkers will help with disputes, she says. There is no formal relationship with landlords, she adds.\n\u201cStreets to Homes does not vet landlords, does not check into records of landlords, does not refer clients to landlords, does not sign leases, does not make decisions for clients, and does not have a list of \u2018vetted\u2019 landlords,\u201d Anderson says. It is not uncommon for people to decide to leave a place and seek another, she says.\nNobody from the city would discuss Ribble\u2019s case, even though he gave permission.\nRibble says he opted to go alone to see the apartment. It was filled with desks, chairs and desktop computers. Property manager Waqar Alam was painting and promised to fix it up, he says. In September, on moving day, nothing had been done, Ribble says, and it took three days to clean it out and get a look at the place.\nHe thought he could handle the repairs and says he asked many times for the right supplies to fix and clean it up, but only got bits of what was needed and spent hundreds on materials, cleaners and tools.\nRibble says his housing worker spoke with Alam, but that didn\u2019t fix the issues. He has lashed out at support and housing workers. Police were called.\nAlam insists he told Ribble he would make the repairs before he moved in, but he says Ribble wanted the place as is, promised to fix it up and was given supplies and money to do so. He says Ribble pulled doors off the kitchen cabinets, damaged a toilet seat and the walls, wouldn\u2019t let him in to do work and did drugs in the apartment.\nIf asked, says Alam, he will do whatever a tenant needs.\nJames Ribble waits for the landlord as he prepares to move out of his basement apartment. ( Steve Russell ) The basement apartment is at the bottom of crumbling concrete steps.\nA tour on Dec. 23, revealed a dingy rectangle, with white tile floors, covered in cracks and holes, around door frames, behind the stove, across the ceiling and in the closet, between the sink and the mirror and inside the bathtub.\nMany were overfilled with spray foam, bulging and discoloured with age. Pieces of carpet poked through the ceiling.\nWriting on every wall bled through a thin coat of paint.\nScrawling black words framed the door, \u201cDid you notice this door is always open . . . I am trying to train my mind . . . The body has house in ruin.\u201d\nIn the back bedroom, Ribble\u2019s sleeping bag was on bare concrete. He says he pulled out mould-covered fabric, baseboards and drywall.\nHe kept the window open to air out the mouldy smell, but no screen meant raccoons \u2014 their paw prints visible on the walls \u2014 would creep in. He slept with a knife.\n\u201cI give them a chance to get out, but they can be nasty.\u201d\nWhen it rained, or snow melted, water ran down the walls. A flood from upstairs ruined his mattress, he says.\nThe tub was so dirty he showered at hostels and only one burner worked on the stove, he says, so he found his meals elsewhere.\nAt home the only way to be comfortable was to use, Ribble says.\n\u201cI know in the long run drugs and alcohol aren\u2019t going to do that for me, aren\u2019t going to take away the problems, but it is just to try and kill it for a little bit.\u201d\nA home, he says, should be a refuge.\n\u201cEspecially if you had a bad day and you do want to use. You can go home, you can sit down, you can eat . . . I couldn\u2019t use the stove.\u201d\nJames Ribble says the bathroom in his basement apartment was so dingy and damaged that he rarely showered at home. ( Steve Russell ) Alam says he has provided good homes to people who otherwise couldn\u2019t get housing for more than a decade, most through city housing workers.\nHis nephew is the owner and landlord, says Alam, who wouldn\u2019t provide a phone number, insisting he handle questions.\nIn Ribble\u2019s case there was no lease and $550 of the rent was from Ontario disability support payments and $400 from the Investment in Affordable Housing for Ontario program, a federal-provincial fund, used for a range of housing programs.\nToronto used $79.2 million from that fund, for 4,945 housing allowances, between 2011 and 2016, said a spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing.\nCouncillor Janet Davis says she has sought but has yet to receive a satisfactory report on all city-run supportive housing programs, including Streets to Homes. When shown photos she described the unit as \u201cappalling\u201d and \u201ctotally unacceptable in terms of the standard of cleanliness and repair.\u201d\nIt is doubly concerning, she says, that the unit was paid for by public dollars and says rigorous inspections, involving Municipal Licensing and Standards staff, should be done before units are rented to people trying to move off the streets and into better lives.\n\u201cClearly no one inspected this before it got recommended to a person who was vulnerable. This is a ticket to homelessness,\u201d she said.\nA new city bylaw approved in March will require the owners of buildings with three or more floors and 10 or more units to register with the city and should mean more oversight and faster repairs at bad buildings.\nBut those new rules won\u2019t apply to three-storey houses with basement apartments, like the place Ribble lived.\nAlam, when asked if he would live in the basement, says yes.\nHe encouraged a Star reporter and photographer to tour a unit on the second floor, with a water-damaged ceiling and where a light fixture dangles from a kitchen wall.\nDead cockroaches form a ring around the fridge.\nIs there a pest problem? \u201cNo, no, this is not pests,\u201d insists Alam.\nWhat is the block of green poison for?\nA tenant pipes up: \u201cRats.\u201d\nJames Ribble packs up his belongings, including a jug of laundry detergent, before vacating the basement apartment he lived in for four months. ( Steve Russell ) The day Ribble moved out, on Dec. 30, the last thing he packed was a bottle of Tide laundry soap.\nThe song \u201cDrive\u201d by the Cars played on a radio he was leaving behind, along with a dresser, mattress, television, DVDs and a pair of ill-fitting work boots given to him by a friend.\nAfter handing over his keys he signed a handwritten contract to end the tenancy. He was reimbursed $700 in cash for January\u2019s rent, minus $250 for missing tools. Ribble says he didn\u2019t take them and doesn\u2019t know who did.\nAlam counted out the $20s, $50s and a $100 bill and another tenant acted as witness.", "ord_in_thread": 0, "title": "Why this man would rather be homeless than live in \u2018appalling\u2019 apartment", "external_links": [], "entities": {"organizations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "municipal licensing"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "star"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ministry of housing"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "support and housing administration"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "toronto"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "richmond sts"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "coxwell ave."}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "regent park"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ribble"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ontario"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "james ribble"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "steve russell"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "patricia anderson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "waqar alam"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "alam"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "anderson"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "coxwell"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "peter"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "ribble"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "janet davis"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-10T14:39:13.792+03:00", "published": "2017-04-10T03:00:00.000+03:00"}, {"url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.4snjSUV.tkGFD_3yflZe4YfE5ia2zSeS_5gHWDbIB3.EH.QTBPgQ.CsCq1LMFkmkzwgOF53SEbNLheBjI9xnNIwWkbjnp2z8e.9QzxUvrJg--", "uuid": "52ad4d7ec414229a2c46ab16a9c78eba5bd8171f", "thread": {"country": "GB", "spam_score": 0.147, "url": "http://omgili.com/ri/jHIAmI4hxg.4snjSUV.tkGFD_3yflZe4YfE5ia2zSeS_5gHWDbIB3.EH.QTBPgQ.CsCq1LMFkmkzwgOF53SEbNLheBjI9xnNIwWkbjnp2z8e.9QzxUvrJg--", "uuid": "52ad4d7ec414229a2c46ab16a9c78eba5bd8171f", "title_full": "Aldi shoppers queue for hours to buy bargain hot tubs and are left fuming - Mirror Online", "replies_count": 0, "site_section": "http://www.mirror.co.uk/play/crosswords/", "site": "mirror.co.uk", "performance_score": 8, "site_full": "www.mirror.co.uk", "site_type": "news", "social": {"stumbledupon": {"shares": 0}, "pinterest": {"shares": 0}, "facebook": {"likes": 838, "shares": 838, "comments": 0}, "linkedin": {"shares": 0}, "vk": {"shares": 0}, "gplus": {"shares": 0}}, "participants_count": 1, "site_categories": ["news", "entertainment", "sports"], "section_title": "Daily crosswords online: quick, easy &amp; cryptic - Mirror Online", "title": "Aldi shoppers queue for hours to buy bargain hot tubs and are left fuming", "domain_rank": 804, "main_image": "http://i3.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article10195953.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/SOCIAL-Aldi-Hot-Tub-26.jpg", "published": "2017-04-10T15:57:00.000+03:00"}, "highlightText": "", "rating": null, "language": "english", "highlightTitle": "", "author": "mirror.co.uk", "text": "Aldi shoppers queue for hours to buy bargain hot tubs and are left fuming It ruined the weekend for quite a few who had their heart set on a cheap spa pool Share Comments By Nicola Oakley 14:57, 10 APR 2017 Updated 15:06, 10 APR 2017 Money Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now Watch Next Beer hotel opening with boozy treatments and full Watch this video again Watch Next ISS astronauts return to Earth in parachute landi 1:33 Shocking cctv shows Ross Barkley getting knocked 0:22 Video will play in This is the hot tub you can pick up in Aldi Share this video Watch Next Share Comments Get money updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing! Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email For weeks people across the country waited for this day to arrive and, yesterday, those bargain Aldi hot tubs finally went on sale.\nAfter being advertised at an already-cheap price of \u00a3399, the budget supermarket spoiled us even more and knocked \u00a3100 off the price.\nOn Thursday the online stock sold out in minutes, so it's no surprise that people couldn't wait to get their hands on the inflatable spa pools when they hit stores across the UK yesterday.\nPeople were reportedly queueing as early as 6.30am. Given that most stores don't open on Sundays until 10am or 11am, that's pretty early.\nThe tub sold out online within hours on Thursday (Photo: PA) It ruined most people's Sundays. One woman tweeted: \"I am so unbelievably hungover with a huge headache and mums dragging me to f***ing Aldi to try and buy a cheap hot tub\"\nBut, alas, most people were left disappointed. And they weren't shy about telling everyone.\nMany found that they had sold out Some claimed they had queued for hours only to be told the store only had two or three in stock or that staff had already sold\nPeople were devastated Angry shoppers even accused staff of buying them first Which obviously isn't the case. Stock is always limited on these Specialbuy items so they do sell out fast if they're popular.\nThen there were those who didn't even want a hot tub and got caught up in the crowds.\nSome people were successful Naturally, anyone who bought a hot tub probably spent the rest of the day inflating it and warming up the water ahead of the lovely summery evening we had last night.\nDid you get your hands on an Aldi hot tub? We'd love to hear what you think of it. E-mail nicola.oakley@yourmirror.co.uk.\nAldi replied to customers to say the Specialbuys range has limited availability and are only available while stocks last.\nWe did say \"once they're gone, they're gone!\" Hopefully Aldi will treat us to another great Specialbuy soon.\nLike us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Money Newsletter Follow @MirrorMoney Subscribe to our Money newsletter Enter email Subscribe Comments Show more comments More On Aldi Viral", "ord_in_thread": 0, "title": "Aldi shoppers queue for hours to buy bargain hot tubs and are left fuming", "external_links": ["https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/trinity-images/logos/mirror.png", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201704/3742/4221396001_5392490529001_5392484469001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/&quot;}", "https://comm-proxy.tm-awx.com/api/publications/mirror/subscriptions/", "http://brightcove01.brightcove.com/24/4221396001/201703/2339/4221396001_5346490744001_5346489863001-vs.jpg?pubId=4221396001", "http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/watch-horror-moment-everton-england-10195873", "https://twitter.com/intent/follow?screen_name=MirrorMoney", "https://www.facebook.com/mirrormoneysaving"], "entities": {"organizations": [{"sentiment": "negative", "name": "aldi"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "facebook follow us on twitter money newsletter follow @mirrormoney subscribe"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "aldi share"}], "locations": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "earth"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "specialbuy"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "uk"}], "persons": [{"sentiment": "none", "name": "ross barkley"}, {"sentiment": "none", "name": "nicola oakley"}]}, "crawled": "2017-04-10T17:24:26.940+03:00", "published": "2017-04-10T15:57:00.000+03:00"}], "totalResults": 438, "requestsLeft": 966, "moreResultsAvailable": 338, "next": "/search?token=b1f36fd9-527a-4fba-aa07-e87606333561&format=json&ts=1491696643490&q=language%3A%28english%29+performance_score%3A%3E4+%28site_type%3Anews%29+site_category%3Asports&sort=performance_score&from=100&sort=desc"}
